During my recent company trip to our Tempe office, I had the chance to stay at Courtyard Marriott. Upon walking in, I could tell that this hotel had been recently renovated and it looked quite nice. The lobby was spacious and had plenty of seating, while the outdoor pool and fitness center were added bonuses. One of the biggest perks was the proximity to the airport and several restaurants within walking distance. As someone who needs their daily caffeine fix, I was pleased to see a Starbucks in the lobby as well as a bistro with basic breakfast and dinner options. Although it's not a full bar, they still offer wine and beer, which was a nice touch. The rooms were pretty standard with the usual amenities, such as a flat screen TV and desk. Overall, this is a decent place to stay, but it didn't really stand out to me. While I don't necessarily have any complaints, there wasn't anything about my stay that really wowed me. It served its purpose as a comfortable place to rest during my business trip, but I don't think I would specifically seek out this hotel for future travels."

After hearing about Pauly D from Jersey Shore DJing at this club, I couldn't wait to check it out. However, upon arriving, the experience was not what I had hoped for. The venue itself was packed, with a line stretching out the door. It was clear that this was a popular spot, but unfortunately, the crowd was not my cup of tea. The dancers and bartenders were all attractive and friendly, but the constant rap music was not my preferred genre. It felt like the same songs were being played on repeat. And to top it off, there was a long line to get a drink at the bar. \nThe VIP aspect of the night was also a letdown. While it was supposed to be a free-roll/VIP event, it felt more like a money-making venture for the club. I even heard that Pauly D was not going to be there that night, despite it being advertised. \nOverall, my experience at this club was underwhelming. It may be your cup of tea if you enjoy a packed club with constant rap music and attractive staff. But for me, it was not worth the wait in line and the inflated prices. I can only imagine what it would be like on a legitimate weekend. Not my scene."

I had high hopes for this restaurant based on the reviews and recommendations I had heard. However, my visit left me feeling extremely disappointed and frustrated. First off, the diet coke I ordered tasted more like water than soda - a clear sign of low quality. Then came the garlic cheese bread, which had a plastic-like taste and left an unpleasant aftertaste. We tried to give the restaurant a chance by informing the staff about the issue, but the replacement bread was just as bad. It seemed like it was straight from a store-bought package. As for our main courses, my fianc√©'s chicken parmesan was a joke - a tiny piece of chicken tucked away to the side of a pile of spaghetti. And let's talk about spaghetti - mine was a complete mess. The meatballs were so hard that I could barely cut through them and they were cold and lacking in flavor. It was clear that they were either store-bought or left to sit for too long. The pasta itself was hard and had no flavor as well, and the marinara sauce tasted like straight canned tomatoes. No garnishes or seasoning in sight. Even the Italian sausage was a disaster - cold and unappetizing. Not to mention, our host mentioned how ""surprisingly busy"" the restaurant was, and I believe that may have been the root of the issue. The kitchen seemed overwhelmed and understaffed, leading to poorly cooked and lackluster food. When we brought our concerns to our server, she apologized and even comped our entire bill - a kind gesture, but not enough to make up for the disastrous meal. The manager, Adam, also apologized and explained that the kitchen was afraid of getting in trouble, which only made matters worse. We ended up leaving without even taking a bite of our food and went somewhere else for dinner. Overall, a huge disappointment and a waste of time and money. I will not be returning to this restaurant and would not recommend it to anyone looking for a quality dining experience."
4,"We experienced overpriced and underwhelming entrees that included the smallest portioned and most watery Seafood Rissoto with the tiniest of muscles and clams we've ever encountered. The Sea Bass was dominated by the taste of olive oil, although a quality piece of fish, and was too small for the price. Our appetizers, Tomato salad and Endive and Beets salad, were pretty good - especially the former. It took too long for entres to arrive while we had to remind the server about our second and side dish. Don't expect to see a wide beer selection. We won't go back."

The windows from this company are definitely a step up from our old ones. My family and I wanted to upgrade our home's appearance and energy efficiency and AVW delivered on both counts. The saleswoman we worked with was knowledgeable and took her time to walk us through all of our options, without ever pressuring us to make a decision. We ended up deciding to replace all of our windows and we're glad we did. Not only do they look beautiful from both the inside and outside, but the wood grain frame perfectly complements our hardwood floors. Plus, we've noticed a significant decrease in heat coming through the windows, which is a huge relief during those hot summer days. The installation process was smooth and the installers were friendly and professional. They even made sure to clean up after themselves, which we appreciated. Overall, we're happy with our decision to choose AVW for our new windows and we're considering them for solar installation as well."
6,"This place was packed and gave me the impression that we were in for a treat. However, the folks eating there must have been heavy smokers because their taste buds had to gone. That's right this place was a solid OK. I can't believe the yelp team couldn't identify average food! The salad was something you buy at the grocery store in a bag. As for the meatballs, it tasted as though they had been made 3 days ago and simply heated. They tasted old and manufactured like something you would eat at a potluck for retired people. The best part of the dinner was the wine. Bottom line, if you want a place that isn't going to break the bank and you are craving Fazoli's, go to Nora's on W. Flamingo. If you are looking for a good Italian meal on the west side . . . try Mastrioni's."

This restaurant is definitely a must-try for those looking for unique and delicious food. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, perfect for a night out with friends. And let's not forget about the amazing service! Our waitress Amy was a delight and really went above and beyond to make our dining experience enjoyable. She gave great recommendations and was full of personality, making us feel like we were dining at a friend's house. The food itself was pretty good, with the foie gras standing out as the star dish. However, I did have a small issue when an employee took an item from the clearance section that I was planning to buy. I believe that customers should have priority over merchandise, especially when it comes to sales items. But overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its tasty food and top-notch service. Can't wait to come back again!"
8,"Yelp map is incorrect.  Location is on the West side of the 101 at Union Hills, and literally overlooks the southbound exit ramp from the 101.  \n\nWhat the hell is it with the stupid Kokopelli theme?  This was somewhat cool for home and restaurant design maybe... 15 years ago or so.  But no, Arizona pizza has resurrected it.\n\nPizza is rather average, as are the appetizers.  Seems to attract the after work happy hour crowd and otherwise isn't really a place that you yearn to visit in any other context.  There are too many other good pizza options."
9," Cannot recommend this place enough.

This hair salon is definitely a gem! I have been going to Sue for years and was excited to hear that she had moved to this new location. The salon is spacious and has a relaxing vibe, perfect for a ""spa day"". During my bachelorette weekend, my friends and I indulged in various services including pedicures, spray tans, massages, and facials. We were all thoroughly pleased with our services and the staff was extremely accommodating. In fact, some of my friends were so impressed that they are planning to come back to the salon to get pampered before my wedding, even flying in from out of state! Overall, this salon exceeded our expectations and we had a great experience. However, I do have to say that the prices were a bit steep and that may influence our decision to return. But, for a special occasion, this salon is definitely worth checking out."
10,"I went with some friends to watch some sunday football. Here's the long & short of it: The wings are fine, not fantastic. That was actually kind of disappointing. I know a lot of people like boneless wings, so if that is your fancy, you will probably be happy! I was impressed by how many beers they had on tap. \n\nThe service wasn't seamless, but I know this is a new location. I'm not eager to return, but if you're in the area or want to watch & football games at once - this is a good place to do it!"

After stepping into this hidden gem, I was pleasantly surprised by the unique and delicious cocktails they serve at this joint. Located just a quick walk from the chaos of Fremont street, this place offers a much-needed respite from the usual Vegas scene. I highly recommend stopping by during happy hour, when their signature drinks are only $7. And let me tell you, those drinks are definitely worth the price. The staff here is top-notch, always willing to explain the ingredients and make recommendations. And let me tell you, they definitely have some interesting and rare ingredients that you won't find at your local liquor store. Overall, this is a great spot to unwind, try something new, and escape the craziness of Sin City. Don't pass up the opportunity to check it out."
12,"4 stars for the ambiance, 2 stars for the food. I loved the fact that the games here are free and the place has a cool vibe. I ordered the teriyaki chicken wings.  It didn't seem very fresh even though they used a good quality product. The wings were also caked in a very thick, ultra sweet sauce. The drinks are reasonably priced and served cold. The music here is a little bit weird, kinda like stuff they play at Pure or The Bank. What is really great is that all the games here are free. If I was 10 years old I would probably be peeing in my pants. I mean, I am able to beat the ol school X-men game! If I tried to do that at a regular arcade, it would probably cost me 20 dollars in quarters! I might return here for the games and drinks but wouldn't come back here for the food."

My first time at Hot n Juicy Crawfish was a bit of a mixed experience. Walking in, I was excited to try out their renowned seafood dishes with my family. However, things got off to a rocky start when I was completely ignored by our server, Amber. As a server myself, I know the importance of good customer service, and I was disappointed by her lack of attention and rushed attitude. It seemed as though she didn't feel the need to give us her best service since the gratuity was already included. Despite her lackluster service, the food itself was delicious. The fries were a bit soggy, but the seafood dishes more than made up for it. However, our drinks were a different story. After having to refill my boyfriend's soda twice, we were dismayed when our raspberry iced tea showed up with a splash of coke in it. Not the most appetizing combination. Despite Amber's careless attitude and unpleasant demeanor, her coworkers were quick to point out her shortcomings. Overall, while the food was tasty, the service left much to be desired. Hopefully, my next visit will be a bit more enjoyable."

The food at this restaurant left much to be desired. We were excited to try the dishes from their extensive menu, only to find out that the portions were underwhelming for the price. Even the take-out we ordered lacked proper serving sizes, leaving us feeling unsatisfied and still hungry. And to top it off, a good portion of our order was missing. It's safe to say we won't be returning anytime soon, especially when there are plenty of other dining options available. Such a shame, given the inviting atmosphere and modern decor. A word of advice - make sure to have a backup plan before choosing this spot as your dining destination."
15,"No. No. No.\n\nCame in a few days ago for a full set of acrylics. Sat down at a manicure station and the chic proceeded to finish polishing her toes before starting my treatment. Didn't even wash her hands. When I asked her if she minded to wash her hands first she rolled her eyes and did as i asked. I should have run then...\nI asked for them super short. being a bartender i cant have long nails. it took her 3 tries to actually finally get them where i wanted them.\nI put in my head phones and relaxed. They came out decent. not the best def not the worst... until the following day\nI wake up only to find my nails had already lifted. When i showered that morning my hair kept getting stuck in them. This isn't supposed to happen for at least 2-3 weeks after... not then next day.\nWhen i went back the \""manager\"" just said no refunds and that was that. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! \nI have yet to find a great nail salon in the mountains edge area. If you have any suggestions please send them my way :)"
16,"went last friday with a friend. bartender was very rude. my friend asked for a black and tan. then he asked her if she knew how to make one. she stopped in her tracks and looked at him and said, you've got to be kidding me. then i asked her if their corned beef was good, and she said, well this is an irish bar, so of course it's good. corned beef was too salty, cabbage was bland, and so were the potatoes. when we asked for the check, we gave her a bogo entree coupon. she looked at us and said, you can't use that now because it's happy hour. i said, well, the entrees are full price and we did have several drinks. she said, i have been in this business for 15 years and that's the way it is. i wish i knew her name, but she is short, with black eyeliner. she was so rude and surely doesn't know about customer service. my friend went into the men's room and he said they had an attendant, shocking. it's a bar, not an upscale hotel. we will never go back. if you want great Irish fare, skeptical chemyst is the place to go, and they know how to treat their customers. AND the black and tan was not made correctly. what she made was a half and half. you can't make a black and tan with Harp beer. so sad that she didn't know that. oh but wait, SHE has been in the business for 15 years, so I guess, this 100% Irish patron doesn't know anything. Get it together McFadden's...you should tell your servers that they are there for the customers, not the other way around."

My experience at this dealership was less than satisfactory. While the location is convenient, the service and quality of cars left much to be desired. The salesmen seemed to lack knowledge and were not reliable in providing accurate information. I did test drive a car with a lower retail price, but the payments were significantly higher than at another dealership. When I asked if they could match the deal, the salesman replied with a rude remark and suggested I go elsewhere. And so I did. I ended up finding a better car with a better deal at another dealership. I would recommend avoiding this dealership and their associates, who seem to have an attitude problem. It's a shame that even basic spelling skills, like the word ""electronics,"" seemed to be lacking in their vocabulary. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience. "
18,"The Good: The food here is really good and unique. We had some really good fish dishes, including octopus, the barbounya and tuna. They all tasted really fresh and were very nicely presented. We ordered 9 dishes (see \""The Ugly\"" below) and I thought that perhaps 6/9 were very delicious.\n\nThe Bad: The setup is very strange. We reserved a table for 3 and we were seated at a bar like table. My friend was seated at the corner so it made it awkward for her to talk to both of us. I much prefer sitting at a table where I can talk to my friends face to face.\n\nThe Ugly: The price!!! As you can tell from the pictures, these dishes are teeny tiny! This restaurant is tapas style, which means you need to order at least 2-3 dishes/person to feel even remotely satisfied. Yet the price here for one dish is comparable to other regular restaurants. We were three girls last night and we ordered 9 tapas to split among us. We each had perhaps 2-3 glasses of wine and we shared two desserts. At the end, the bill for each was $100 (including tip)! \n\nI had a fun time, but I will not be back."
19,"The Orange Chicken I ordered arrived swimming in sauce, and it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  It appears they have resolved any issues with their rice, and overall I would recommend this restaurant to someone wanting to find Chinese/American food in Surprise.  Not entirely authentic Chinese by any means, but probably as good as any out here in the far NW valley.  Good if you want to stick close to home, and ample parking."

I've been to Paris Envy a few times now and I have to say, the merchandise here is hit or miss. While the concept and aesthetic of the boutique is charming, the actual items for sale are just not up to par. During my last visit, I picked out a few unique gifts for friends, but when I got home and unwrapped them, I was pretty underwhelmed. The quality just didn't match the price point. However, I will say that Laurie, the owner, was extremely friendly and helpful in assisting me with my purchases. The atmosphere of the boutique is also inviting and calming, making it a great place to browse. Maybe next time I'll stick to the jewelry or home decor items, as I've had better luck with those in the past. Overall, while Paris Envy is worth checking out, I wouldn't rely on it as my go-to for finding gifts or home goods."
21,"Mediocre at best.  This place is a wonderful example of American cuisine gone wrong.  When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile, the food is well, boring (i.e. Chipotle Mayo).\n\nRed Robin is a burgers and fries type place, fried everything.  Fried everything should be DELICIOUS!  What is missing?\n\nThe presentation of all the dishes is fine, it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing.  Had a burger and onion rings, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, it was completely forgettable.\n\nThe atmosphere is very corporate.\n\nThe service is designed to be good, but falls flat, again too corporate (waiter virtually up your ass when you don't need him, and not around when you do).\n\nIn summary, there are way better places to spend your time, money and calories.  We gave it a shot, and it wasn't our cup of tea.  If you like it, more power to you.  \n\nI usually do not review restaurants until I have given them several chances and tried different items, but I won't be returning.  I just can't bring myself to eat here.  The food is edible, but while I was eating, I actually wondered to myself why I was eating it."

I've visited this salon a handful of times for pedicures and although I've been mostly satisfied with the end result, I can't help but feel a bit put off by the front desk staff. It's a shame that their lack of friendliness leaves a sour taste in my mouth and ultimately affects my overall experience. I've never received a warm greeting or a smile, which makes me question if they truly appreciate their customers. Despite the cute aesthetic and emphasis on cleanliness, I refuse to give my business to a place that lacks basic hospitality. It's time for the management to address this issue and train their staff to be more welcoming and hospitable to their paying customers. Until then, I'll be taking my business elsewhere."
23,"A decent spot to eat at. Our waitress wasn't as fast as she could have been considering it wasn't packed. Most of the food was tasty especially the molcajete but we had three complaints that kept coming up around the table. The fish was very sub-par, over cooked, and over seasoned. The rice was a little soggy and it was very tasteless, it was almost hard to eat to be honest. To finish it off the salsa was very watery and it felt like it was missing something. All In all, it was an alright spot I doubt we will be going back considering the long drive but I wouldn't count it out for good."
24,I used to come here all the time with friends for the ufc ppv and before it was always packed and the service and drinks were great. Now a few months later I came here and the place has completely gone downhill. The food has changed and I ordered a margherita and I got some fruity drink that has a rotten lime in it. New management or something ruined it. Never again will I come here.
25,"I feel mixed about writing this review. With all I will document below, I still will stop in again for some hot-and-readys in the future. So, initially I was super excited to realize that there was a Little Caesar's on Center close to home- though I hate that shopping area because the traffic is always terrible and it's a nightmare getting in and out of. I planned a pizza night with a friend and timed it perfectly to stop in here for hot-and-ready pizzas after work to bring home. I even called in earlier to make sure that I could stop straight in, buy pizzas, and walk out.  I realize that it was right after work when they are probably at their busiest, but I walked in and there were no hot-and-ready pizzas there! Plus, there were only two people working! It upsets me when businesses advertise specials or deals and can't guarantee or follow through with them. I didn't have to wait long (maybe 10-15 min), but I implore Little Caesar's to ONLY promise hot-and-ready pizzas when they are both hot AND ready. On the other hand, the woman behind the counter was intent on getting the pizzas out as soon as possible and was incredibly nice- it's possible that they were simply understaffed for the day. And in their defense, the pizzas were hot and still tasted great- and you can't beat the price! The other items on their menu are a great deal two (i.e., only $3 for crazy bread sticks). With that said, I will definitely be stopping in again for those deals."
26,"The food was great, the service was to amazing, drinks even better. So I suppose you're wondering why I'm giving 2 stars? The poor staff is stretched so damn thin there it's disgusting. My friend and I went many times when we were there because of their vegan menu. It was tough a couple of times service wise. But one time our waitress (who was such a sweetheart! I don't remember her name but she was a lovely, thin yoga teaching girl) was trying so hard to make sure we got our food and drink in a timely matter. The bartender was too busy not paying attention to the orders, and then they ran out of margarita stuff! We were there for punk rock bowling, and I guess the manager (who you could tell was there wearing some hideous lilac colored shirt, really dude?), was too busy sitting on his phone to notice his staff was running around trying to do the work of 5 people per person. \n\nLong story short, food is awesome, drinks... awesome. The waitstaff, fantastic. But man, I hope they're more prepared next year so I don't have to wait 30 minutes for my food and or margarita."
27,"

Unfortunately, our experience at this restaurant was quite disappointing. Despite the appealing variety on the menu, the service was incredibly slow and disorganized. It took us nearly two hours to receive our meals, and we were constantly reminding our server for even the simplest things like a hummus plate. To make matters worse, there was no apology or explanation for the delay.

While the food was average, it was not worth the long wait. The Philly cheese pita we ordered was lacking in both quantity and quality. In fact, it seemed like there were only a few measly slices of green pepper and onion on the entire dish. Additionally, we were served diet pepsi instead of diet coke, with no acknowledgement or effort to correct the mistake.

We were eventually able to overlook the issues with the food and beverage, as we knew it would take ages for a correction. However, the lack of communication and poor service left a sour taste in our mouths. It's a shame because the ambiance of the restaurant was actually quite pleasant, resembling the old Tambellini's. But unfortunately, our overall experience fell short due to the inadequate service."

It was my first time flying with USAIR and unfortunately, I had a layover in Phoenix on my way to Las Vegas. Let me just say, I would never choose to go through that airport again, especially not with USAIR. The customer service was beyond horrible, and it was all thanks to a certain young woman named Jade. I have never encountered someone so on a power trip in my life.

From the moment I stepped foot at the airport, Jade was already giving off an unpleasant vibe. And it only went downhill from there. Instead of being helpful and accommodating, she seemed more interested in threatening my ability to get on the plane. Every time I asked a question or raised a concern, she would just bluntly say, ""I can un-seat you. That means you won't be taking the plane."" Excuse me? Is this how USAIR trains their employees to handle customers?

But it wasn't just Jade that was the problem. The whole experience at the Phoenix airport was a nightmare. I had trouble finding my gate, and when I asked for directions, the staff were uninterested and seemed more focused on their own personal conversations. And when I finally made it onto the plane, I was greeted by attendants who were clearly unfamiliar with customer service. It seemed like they were just going through the motions, and I was just another passenger to them.

Honestly, I wish I had just flown with Virgin instead. I've heard great things about their customer service and now I truly regret not choosing them. The only saving grace was my quick layover and plane change in Las Vegas, where the USAIR staff were actually kind and helpful. But that doesn't make up for the terrible experience I had in Phoenix.

My advice to anyone considering flying with USAIR, especially through Phoenix, is to be prepared for a lack of customer service and a lot of empty threats. It's a shame because the experience at the Las Vegas airport was so different. But unfortunately, one bad apple like Jade can really ruin the whole bunch. I don't think I'll be risking it with USAIR again anytime soon. "
29,"The food was good, but the reason of the low stars was because of the slow service, we ordered food which came timely, but after dinner we wanted to order dessert, but the server paid no attention to us, and we waited for 30 minutes for the dessert menu. Nice food, but not sure if will come again due to service"

I was excited to try this place out with some friends, as I had heard good things about their burgers. The restaurant had a classic drive-in vibe, which was fun and nostalgic. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when it took a good half hour to get our food. I understand that good food takes time, but this was a bit excessive.

When our food finally arrived, I was satisfied with my garden burger. It was decent, but nothing special. The seasoned fries were definitely the highlight of the meal - crispy and flavorful. My friends who ordered burgers said they were fresh and tasty, but nothing too exceptional. And while it was nice that they offered tater tots, I couldn't help but feel annoyed by the long wait.

Overall, the food was decent but nothing outstanding. What really brought down my experience was the wait time. In a bustling city like this, I expect quick and efficient service, especially for a simple meal like burgers and fries. Next time, I'll probably opt for a more reliable spot for a quick and tasty lunch. "

Despite being a regular at Sandwich Culture, my recent experience at this sandwich spot left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. My usual quick and easy lunch stop was anything but when I encountered some major issues.

To start off, their online check-in system did make the process of getting my food a breeze, which was a plus considering the chaos on the streets due to the ongoing tram works. However, the positives stopped there. As soon as I stepped into the bathroom, the overwhelming stench of sewage hit me, making my appetite disappear. And to top it off, the closet door in my room was completely unhinged and just laying on its side. I couldn't believe the state of my room, and even attached a picture to prove my point.

I called guest services, hoping they would send someone to address these problems, but all they did was send a cleaning crew who merely sprayed a bunch of chemicals in the room to mask the smell. And as for the closet door, no engineer ever came to fix it. To make matters worse, my request for the sheets to be changed due to the chemical smell was also ignored. I am seven months pregnant and I did not want to expose myself or my unborn child to those harmful fumes. But when I returned from dinner, the sheets were still unchanged, and all they did was give me two extra pillows, which were also stained.

Despite its convenient location and friendly staff, I cannot recommend Sandwich Culture based on my recent experience. The lack of cleanliness and maintenance in my room was unacceptable and left a bad taste in my mouth (both figuratively and literally). I hope this review serves as a warning to others, especially those who may be lured in by the chain shops around the area. Don't be fooled, this place may be cheap, but the quality is not worth it."
32,I've been screwed twice on sessions I bought from this place! I've trained at this gym off and on for a year and use to love the workouts but apparently the gym is under new ownership and now my sessions that I bought are no longer good. I can't blame that on the new owner but this is ridiculous and I won't be returning or recommending anybody to go here.

I was really excited to try this place out based on the recommendations I had heard from friends. However, my experience was far from pleasant. The service was slow and the staff seemed uninterested in making our dining experience enjoyable. Our waitress was no exception. She was not welcoming or friendly at all. 

To make matters worse, the food was disappointing. I ordered the Florentine omelette and was horrified to find that it was oozing with raw egg and overflowing with garlic. It was hardly appetizing and I couldn't even finish it. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito, which was just okay. It tasted like something you would find on a dollar menu at a fast food joint. 

The atmosphere, while cozy and intimate, was overshadowed by the mediocre food and lackluster service. I expected more from this place, especially considering the variety of options they offer on their menu. Sadly, my expectations were not met and I left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."

Honestly, I wanted to love Sushi Eye. The concept of a rotating sushi belt sounded so cool and unique. But unfortunately, our experience fell flat. When we arrived, the place was nearly empty and yet we still had to wait for a waiter to take our drink orders. And let's talk about the appetizers. We ordered fries but they arrived at our table after our main dishes. And speaking of our dishes, they all seemed to be cooked at the same temperature, regardless of how we ordered them. It's a shame because the food itself was actually pretty tasty, but the slow and inattentive service really put a damper on our meal. Plus, the prices were not reflective of the quality of service we received. I was really hoping for better from a place that seems to pride itself on a modern and hip atmosphere. Maybe if they focused a bit more on their service training and read some of their own reviews, they could really step up their game. But for now, I think I'll stick to my regular sushi spots."

As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry and frequented clubs in Vegas, I have to say that this place is a disaster. The prices are exorbitant, with no justification for charging such high prices for drinks and cover. And don't even get me started on the bathrooms - co-ed? Seriously? Who thought that was a good idea? The music is mediocre at best, the crowd is a mishmash of tourists and drunk locals, and the atmosphere is far from exclusive. This isn't the place to see and be seen, it's the place to be bored and overcharged. And let's not forget the blatant favoritism towards those who know the ""right"" people. Good luck getting in without waiting in an endless line if you don't have your own personal connection. Save your money and your dignity and head somewhere else for a Vegas night out. Trust me, you'll thank me later."
36,"I had saw handmade burger for the past two years and FINALLY went last night! Got taken to a table by a very friendly staff. The restaurant was quite busy. We got given our menus, sitting there like a good 10-15 minutes trying to decide what to get. A decided to get the small chicken classic burger with Greek Feta. I have to say I'm not a big fan of burger but i have had better burger than this! The chicken was dry with no taste, the burger had chutney in it which it wasn't meant to have. Other than all that the service was very good and the staff were very friendly!"
37,Very nice atmosphere almost upscale.  Nice ambience.  The service is very good and fast.  Here at 700 and only 3 tables.  Unfortunately the food IMHO doesn't measure to the restaurant is just average.  The pad Thai was just average the pa nang just ok the beef salad was good.  I give 3 stars cause the staff and ambiance are great but food is just average Vegas has some tough Thai competition
38,"The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, \""I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity.\"" \n\nI was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.\n\nFurthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that \""You whites have been stealing from us for years.\""  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...\n\nSir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business. \n\nIf you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place. \n\nIf you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look."

I visited this restaurant multiple times during my stay in AZ, and each time, I was left extremely disappointed. The service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. Despite asking for rice multiple times, it never came. And to make matters worse, the water was never refilled, even though there were only four tables occupied and two ladies working. It's unfathomable to me how they could forget a requested item three times and something as basic as water. Even when we asked for the check, we had to remind them twice, and it wasn't until the next shift came that we finally received it.

I don't recommend anyone eating here, as the service is slow and forgetful. The food may be cheap, but it's definitely not worth it for the poor service you'll receive. Trust me, I've learned my lesson and won't be returning for a fourth time. Instead, I suggest heading to Honey Pig for a much better dining experience. The food and service there are way superior. Don't waste your time or money at this disappointing establishment."
40,"Not bad....\n\nThink Postino's, Vig, Tuck Shop, and St. Francis in terms of design, ambience, parking, and lighting.  The Windsor's menu is a little different and considerably more sandwich-oriented than the foregoing restaurants, and the servers are a tad more 'edgy' looking, but the Windsor can more or less stand as a lunchtime equal with them.\n\nBut I did suffer with a rather serious problem during my visit - strictly related to the food itself.\n\nI ordered the Crab BLT, an intriguing idea on paper, and a very attractive plate once it is set before your eyes.  I selected Jo Church's potatoes as my side dish.  My wife ordered the Schreiner's sausage with cole slaw.\n\nThe good:  The Schreiner's sausage was amazingly flavorful and quite well dressed with peppers and the like.  The thick 'Tenderbelly Bacon' crumbled throughout my Crab BLT was perfectly cooked with a slight char.  And the BUNS, oh those delicious toasted, buttered buns!!!\n\nThe not-so-good:  They seemed to really just phone-it-in on the side dishes.  The cole slaw my wife ordered seemed right out of a Basha's bag or something in terms of appearance and flavor, and the Jo Church's potatoes (creamy, shredded hash browns) were cold, undercooked, and underseasoned.  Indeed, the potatoes were on the threshold of being simply \""bad and bland\"" which is quite a sad feat considering the taters looked so good.  Also, the music did seem a tad bit on the loud side for a place like this.\n\nThe downright FOUL:  I can't help it, I wish I didn't have to say it, but I do....the crab in my crab cakes was absolutely, positively foul.  It was well breaded, well cooked, and well seasoned, so the fault did not lie in the execution, but rather in the senile old grandpa of a crab they used for my cakes.  For such a flaw to be so apparent in what is supposed to be the star of my dish, I must issue the dreaded punitive star rating.  :( \n\nI suspect I will be revising this review in the future, and in an upward direction in terms of stars.  There was quite a bit of good things in the air and on the plate that warrants a second visit, and if I order just right, I suspect I will come away with a very happy, four star experience."
41,"Great concept but just doesn't work well here.  The employees just are NOT with the program. Been here three times and the film was late each time. Employees didn't seem to care nor did the mgr when I complained.  Theatre was dirty twice  and sound was way too low the other. This is how it might get after ten years, not three months. FAIL!"
42," The service was also pretty slow and unattentive. Drinks were not refilled in a timely manner and we had to continuously flag down the server for anything we needed. \n\n3 stars because of the clean atmosphere and decent prices, but wouldn't recommend for the food. \n- lackluster entrees \n- slow and inattentive service \n- greasy and tasteless side dishes \n\n Unfortunately, AJK Chinese Cusine was a let down for me. I had heard good things about it, but my experience was not great. I probably won't be returning. Don't waste your time and money on this place, you can find better Chinese food elsewhere."

I was really hoping for a great pizza experience, but unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The pizza itself was pretty good, but the crust was just too thick for my liking. It was practically a whole inch on the bottom! And to top it off, my salad was nothing special - I'm pretty sure it was just iceberg lettuce. Not to mention, their delivery area is limited, so if you're not within their range, you're out of luck. And don't even get me started on the silverware situation. I had to pay an extra $0.10 per piece for plastic silverware because they don't deliver to my location, which is only 1.5 miles away! Trust me, I'll be saving that plastic cutlery for the next time I order from them. My hope is that my experience was just a fluke due to it being winter break, but overall, I was pretty disappointed. On the bright side, the delivery driver was friendly and the hostess was welcoming when I picked up my order. All in all, they have some work to do before I would consider ordering from them again."

I was looking for a hotel with a prime location and reasonable price, and this one caught my attention. The lobby was well organized and the check-in process was smooth and quick. I was disappointed to find out that they charge for wi-fi, which seems a bit outdated in this day and age. Additionally, the lack of a microwave and refrigerator in the suites was inconvenient, especially for longer stays. I had to resort to dining at the hotel's restaurants, which ended up being a bit pricey. On top of that, the noise from the room above was noticeable and disrupted my sleep at times. 
Despite these setbacks, the hotel's location was perfect for me. It was only a short 15-minute drive from the strip, making it convenient to explore all that the city has to offer. The cleanliness and organization of the hotel were also commendable. The room was well-maintained and the housekeeping service was prompt and efficient. The staff were also friendly and provided good service. 
Overall, I would recommend this hotel for its location, cleanliness, and service, but be prepared to pay for wi-fi and make do without a microwave and refrigerator in the suites. It may not be perfect, but it's still a good option for those on a budget."
45,"This place is actually pretty fun to go to at night. In the daytime, it is a really chill place to hang out with friends and drink beer. The food (tacos) are not bad. They are on the small side but taste pretty good. \n\nThe only problem that I have with this place is that it does not smell very good. It's not extremely dirty (it is as clean as it can be with a ton of drunk people around all the time) but it just smells like bathroom."

After hearing about Fajitas on Fire from a friend, I had been looking forward to trying it out. Unfortunately, my experience did not quite live up to the hype. While the chips and salsa were good and the margaritas were excellent, the rest of the food left much to be desired. My partner and I ordered the fajitas for two with steak and shrimp, and while the portion size was generous, the quality did not match up. The meat was tough and lacked flavor, and the lack of traditional Mexican dishes like gyros was disappointing. To make matters worse, we felt pressured by our server to order certain items, which did not contribute to an enjoyable dining experience. Overall, we left feeling underwhelmed and probably won't be returning anytime soon, especially with so many other great restaurants like Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy just a stone's throw away. While the flaming fajitas and mariachi band were nice touches, it wasn't enough to make up for the lackluster food and pushy service. I would recommend checking out one of the nearby options for a more satisfying dining experience."
47,"My experience with Seksun was just ok. It was Friday night at 6pm the place was dead. I saw the conveyor belt, probably a 2 minutes loop compared with what we had before a 6 minutes loop in Oregon this belt felt short. The same 10 dishes were going around and around. I ordered some hamachi sashimi, fried veggie spring rolls and 2 spicy hand rolls because the belt selection was very limited."

My friends and I were looking for a quick breakfast spot before our hike and decided to try out Einsteins at the Richmond location. The exterior of the restaurant was a bit run-down and the parking lot was crowded, but we had high hopes for the food since we have always had positive experiences at other Einsteins locations. \n\nUpon entering, we were disappointed to find the overall atmosphere of the restaurant to be a bit dingy and unclean. The tables were sticky and the floor had crumbs scattered around. However, we brushed it off and went to place our order at the counter. The employees were not very welcoming or friendly, which was a stark contrast to the usual upbeat and cheerful service we are used to at Einsteins. We were also surprised to see one employee's shirt stained with food. \n\nDespite the subpar customer service, the bagels and coffee were still delicious. The cream cheese was thick and flavorful, and the bagels were perfectly toasted. We were also grateful that our order was served quickly so we could be on our way to our hike. However, the unprofessionalism and lack of upkeep of the restaurant left us with a disappointing experience. \n\nWhile I will still continue to be a loyal Einsteins customer, I will definitely not be returning to this particular location again. I hope they can improve the cleanliness and customer service to match the quality of their food. "

We were excited to try 40th St Cafe, a place that holds so many sentimental memories for my family. However, our recent visit left us disappointed and disillusioned. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that the staff was understaffed and inexperienced. It's a shame because the space could accommodate so many more tables, but instead, we were left with slow and inadequate service. To make matters worse, the food was subpar. The muffins looked enticing, but were unfortunately dry and flavorless. The omelet and potatoes were greasy and tasted like they were straight out of a can. Needless to say, our stomachs were not happy with the outcome. Even the salad dressing, which is usually a safe bet, was disgustingly unappetizing. To top it all off, we ended up spending quite a bit for a meal that we could barely stomach. It pains me to give a negative review to a place that has such a special place in my heart, but our experience was a complete miss."
50,"I had never been to CG and decided to indulge myself a little while out of town on business. After a brief conversation with a foodie friend, I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience. \n\nFood: 1 Star \n\nFor fancy steakhouses, I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce. \n\nI've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it. I did order some bleu cheese crumbles to go with it but it didn't mix well either. I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit! \n\nBut to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal. I am assuming my problem was remote and hopefully only a local problem but it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next time I goto a nice steakhouse. \n\nService: 4 Star \n\nService was great, but obviously, who cares if you get crap at your plate?"

I visited this restaurant on a whim with my boyfriend after having a craving for a Banh Mi. As soon as we walked in, we were not impressed. The lack of customers was a clear sign that something may not be right here. But we decided to give it a chance anyway. 
We were seated next to a fish tank, which I will admit was a unique touch, but the rest of the decor was just plain cheesy. The whole underwater theme was a bit much for me. 
We ordered the spring rolls and a sliced pork Banh Mi, while my boyfriend opted for a pho. The spring rolls were decent, but the pho was a complete disappointment. The broth was flat and lacked any real flavor, no matter how many condiments we added to it. 
However, I do have to give credit where credit is due. The bread used for the Banh Mi was simply amazing. It was buttery and had the perfect amount of crunch. It was definitely the highlight of our meal. I may just come back for a baguette in the future. 
The staff was efficient in seating us and attending to our needs, so I will give them that. But unfortunately, their bread and service were not enough to make up for the overall mediocre experience. I would think twice before returning to this place."
52,"I've been here a couple times, and the food is alright. Nothing special about it, but I might be biased since I usually have homemade Filipino food.\n\nWe ordered beef calderetta, pork adobo, grilled bangus, and halo halo for dessert. The beef calderetta was actually pretty good. I think I'd have to say it was my favorite dish of the night. It kind of tasted sweet, not typical of any calderetta I've ever had but I'm not complaining. The pork adobo was also a little sweeter than any adobo I'm used to. As for the grilled bangus, it was...really bland. And the halo halo didn't even have buko in it! While the food was okay, it didn't taste authentically Filipino to me.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. There would be times where the waiters and waitresses would always check up on us, followed by periods of neglect. Also, the waiting time for the food was really long, considering it wasn't that busy.\n\nOverall, this was place alright. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone was going to take me here."
53,"This is a great hotel if you don't plan on gambling.  However, I like to play blackjack in Vegas and the Palazzo has lowered the black jack payout from 3- 2 to 6 - 5.  In other words they more than doubled the casino's take/ how much you are expected to lose.  I think this is a very scummy move and there are plenty of other great hotels to chose from."
54,"What an unbelievable disappointment. The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left.\n\nWe had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.  \n\nImagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of \""cracker-like\"" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.\n\nNow, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.\n\nAfter my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.\n\nThe pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.\n\n20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. \n\nThe high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck."
55,"We had the pine nut/chicken salad, very good, just the right amount of dressing. Pizza was pepperoni and mushroom again not to much sauce, (no pun intended ;) Overall, I can see this as a 'go to place' . \n\nSide note: I will say the service impressed me, even though the busboy was working it, every time he passed our table, he asked if we needed anything and took care of whatever."

My friends and I decided to try out the lunch buffet at L & B Inn during our visit to Prisonville. We were excited to discover this spot, as there aren't many Mexican buffets in the area. The buffet had a small selection of only 14 items, but we were willing to give it a try since other restaurants have successfully pulled off a small buffet. However, we were disappointed with the overall experience.

I started off with the potato soup, which would have been good if it had meatballs in it like I had seen at other buffets. The salad was just okay, and I was disappointed to see there was no beef for the tacos. My plate ended up being filled with just cheese enchiladas, beans, rice, and a few other toppings. The chips and salsa were good, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of options.

The price was also a bit steep at $8.49 per person, which only included one trip to the buffet line. Compared to my previous experience at True Foods, this just didn't measure up. The food was mediocre and the buffet options were limited. The only upside was the friendly staff, but that alone couldn't save this dining experience for me.

Overall, I would not recommend the lunch buffet at L & B Inn. It just wasn't worth the price and there are much better options available in the area. Maybe try out their regular menu instead. Meh."
57,"We ordered 3 bedroom sets and 2 mattresses from this place.  We were told we would have our furniture within 7-10 days. The delivery guys have been here 3 separate times now, to drop off random pieces.  The first time they came, they brought the wrong sized beds.  Now, almost 3 months after we bought our furniture, we are STILL waiting on a dresser.  90 days is a far cry from 7-10 days.  \nBUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Although this restaurant has been open for a while, our recent dining experience here was extremely disappointing. We were excited to try a new Mexican spot in the area, especially since the last restaurant in this space seemed to struggle. However, from the moment we walked in, we could tell that this place was not going to live up to our expectations. The atmosphere was lackluster and we noticed a few servers running around trying to keep up with a full house. Despite the chaos, we were optimistic and decided to give it a try.

Sadly, our optimism quickly faded as we waited for our food for what seemed like an eternity. We felt like we were barely acknowledged by our server, who was too busy with other tables and seemed annoyed whenever we asked about our order. The dishes finally arrived, one by one, and each one was more lackluster than the last. The portions were small and uninspiring, and the flavors were bland. We couldn't help but feel disappointed and unsatisfied with our experience.

To make matters worse, the service never improved throughout the night. Our server never checked on us or apologized for the long wait, and we were left feeling neglected. At the end of our mediocre meal, we were simply handed the check and our server vanished without another word. It was clear that this restaurant still has a lot of room for improvement, and we won't be returning anytime soon. Disappointing food, lackluster service, and an overall unimpressive experience - I can't recommend this place to anyone."

Too Good to be True: Let me start by saying, this dental office truly lives up to its name. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with the most genuine and friendly customer service. And this was just the beginning of my stellar experience here.

The office itself is equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, making my appointment quick and efficient. In fact, I was amazed at how thorough and knowledgeable my hygienist, Michelle Hayes, was. She even taught me how to properly floss - game changer! But what really stood out to me was her honesty and upfront approach. I felt like I was in good hands the entire time.

Now, I must admit, I am not one to eagerly anticipate my next dental appointment. But after experiencing the level of care and expertise here, I am actually looking forward to my next visit in a few months. That's how great this place is!

The only reason I am not giving it a 5-star rating is because I did have a bit of trouble following the storyline of the Cirque du Soleil show, Le Reve. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a spectacle with hot men and amazing acrobatics. But 75 minutes of it was a bit too much for me. And let's just say, the ""splash zone"" seats didn't really live up to their name. But overall, it was still an enjoyable experience.

In conclusion, Elegant Smile Dentistry may not be as flashy as a Cirque du Soleil show, but it definitely exceeds expectations in terms of customer service, efficiency, and expertise. Don't be fooled by the lack of reviews, this place truly deserves Yelp's highest honor for medical facilities. Trust me, you won't regret making an appointment here. It's just too good to be true."

As a regular at this specific Crazy Mocha location, I can confidently say that it's the perfect spot to fuel up for my morning commute. It's clean, always smells of freshly brewed coffee, and the staff is always friendly and efficient. Unlike other coffee shops where baristas can come off as dismissive and uninterested, the employee at this location is always welcoming and ready to help. 

The ambiance is modern and sleek, making it a great place to work or catch up with friends. And let's not forget about the drinks - they definitely hit the spot. I'm a fan of their iced coffee and I always make sure to add an extra shot to keep me going throughout the day. And it's always consistently good, which is something I value as a regular customer.

However, I do have to knock off a star because of the occasional overcrowding issue. It seems like this place is a popular spot for the homeless population in the area, and they tend to congregate around the Internet computer section. It can be a bit distracting and off-putting, but I try to just focus on my work and mind my own business.

Overall, this Crazy Mocha location is a solid choice for a cup of Joe. It may not be the largest or most high-tech establishment, but it's conveniently located and consistently delivers on quality drinks and friendly service. Just make sure to keep those interruptions to a minimum, and you'll have a great experience. "

Although we had high hopes for this place, we were ultimately disappointed with our experience. The wait time was reasonable and the price was decent, but the food fell short of our expectations. My husband's pastrami burger was the only redeeming dish, with a generous amount of pastrami. My daughter's avocado burger, on the other hand, barely lasted five minutes on her plate. Both my youngest daughter and son enjoyed their Jr. cheeseburgers, but for the price we paid, we were expecting more than just a decent burger. The bacon on my bacon burger was thankfully not fatty, but overall it was a lackluster meal. The fries were under-seasoned for some, and over-salted for others. However, the portion size was satisfactory and the fried zucchini was a highlight. We left feeling unsatisfied and wishing we had gone to our usual spot in Phoenix. Perhaps with quicker service, this place could improve, but for now, we'll be taking our business elsewhere. "

This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to in my life. I'm a regular so I know bad chipotle when I see one. They don't pay attention to your request, so you have to repeat you order over and over. That's the third time this has happened in a month. I'm done personally, save your time and avoid this location. Drive to the camelback location or go downtown. Trust me!"

I have to say, the service at this place is top-notch. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and friendly. She even gave us a free drink when we bought show tickets! And let me tell you, those drinks are no joke - they come in a cool collector glass that lights up. My husband and I loved it so much that we went back just to get another cup. As for the food, they have a good selection of appetizers that are perfect for a light snack. Plus, the prices are very reasonable. It's definitely a great spot to rest your feet and grab a bite to eat. However, I have to admit that the food itself was just okay. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. We've had better appetizers elsewhere. But all in all, I would recommend this place if you're looking for a decent spot to relax and grab a drink. Just don't expect to be blown away by the food."

I was excited to try out this hotel after hearing about its great location on the strip. And the discounted rate for an upgraded room was a bonus. However, my stay was not without its faults. The construction going on during my stay was a bit annoying, but I understand that these things happen. What was more frustrating was the room cleaning staff walking in at 11am while I was trying to get dressed for lunch. But, I did appreciate the classic and beautiful pool and the convenience of being within walking distance to other popular hotels on the strip.

On the positive side, the service at the roulette table was top-notch and definitely made up for the penny slot that broke on me. The staff was friendly and attentive, making the gaming experience enjoyable. And despite the loud construction noise, the restrooms were surprisingly clean. Also, the classic theme of the hotel added a charming touch.

However, my biggest disappointment was with the quality of the mozzarella in my caprese salad. It was some of the worst I've ever had at a restaurant, and for an Italian-themed hotel, that's just unacceptable. It made me question the daily checks on ingredients by the chef. But, I will say that the location and some of the positive aspects of my stay make me hesitant to completely write off this hotel. It's worth giving it a try and forming your own opinion."

She lacked energy and it doesn't appear that she's in shape to work the crowd.\n\nAdd to that the insane lines at the bars (we waited 42 minutes and got our drinks as the show began), the unusually rude security guards, and the fact that the backup band didn't even seem to be live and it just wasn't worth it. \n\nI wanted to like it!"

I recently visited this place for breakfast and was disappointed by my overall experience. The menu was extensive, offering 20 sandwiches, 15 burgers, and 30 dinner entrees, which immediately raised some red flags for me. How can a kitchen possibly prepare and serve so many dishes well? It's no surprise then, that the breakfast wrap I ordered was lackluster and unappetizing. The cheese inside tasted like processed nacho cheese and lacked any real flavor. And let's not even talk about the presentation, which looked like something straight out of a cafeteria. The tiny, cheap plates only added to the disappointment.

To make matters worse, our server never checked on us for coffee refills. At breakfast. Yikes. And don't even get me started on the owner, Phil. He never seems to be in a good mood and his unfriendly demeanor makes it clear that he doesn't care about his customers. I couldn't believe he actually had the audacity to serve food while wearing a scowl on his face.

In my opinion, there are much better breakfast options out there. You would be better off going to The Good Egg, Chompies, or Flapjack's. Anywhere but here, really. The only redeeming quality about this place is the variety of dishes on the menu, but unfortunately, quantity does not necessarily equal quality. Oh, and don't even bother with the Wi-Fi, it's not worth the frustration."
67,"My companion and I used a Groupon at this place on the first day of our 12-day National  Parks road trip.  We spent the first two nights in Vegas,  so we conveniently had dinner here.  Our evening got off to a rocky start, as we were seated and not acknowledged by any of the wait staff for at least 10 minutes.  Finally we flagged down a waitress, who did not have our table in her rotation, but being that we were rather irate, she waited on us for our meal.  There was apparently some confusion as to who had us, and later in the meal when our original waiter was serving us too, Roger and I didn't know what to make of this haphazard arrangement.  It was nice that we could use part of our Groupon on the dinner specials, so I had the prime rib.  Roger had the short ribs.  The side dishes were quite good, and our mixed drinks were good, too.  The prime rib wasn't the best I ever tasted, but it was a good dish anyway.  The desserts were delicious: a blueberry cheesecake for Roger, and a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for me.   We tipped our waittress fairly well for making  good for the staff's initial lapse in service.  Don't think we would dine here again, but it was fun to enjoy a meal in one of the old-school casinos we had never visited before."
68,"We came in here to walk off our food coma from Sushi Mon, and this place is super huge and carries quite a variety of merchandise. We came before Christmas, so they had a section of items that would make pretty cool gifts like a hot pink Blu-Ray player for $60. There were some good deals too, like a bag of Clementine oranges for $3 with card. The employees I had encountered here were some of the friendliest in the grocery store business, so that alone, would be worth 4 stars."

As a group of four, we stopped by this restaurant for a quick bite to eat. We all ordered something different, but I decided to go for the tuna sandwich. Boy, was I surprised when it came out smothered in pepper! I'm not a fan of spicy food, so this was definitely not what I was expecting. However, the staff was very accommodating and quickly replaced my sandwich with a chicken salad sandwich. Kudos to the guy working behind the counter for being so friendly and helpful. The sandwich itself was nothing special, just your average chicken salad on bread. But the exceptional customer service definitely made up for it. Although the food didn't blow me away, I have to give credit to the staff for their fantastic service. Two stars for the food, but four stars for the service."

I had heard great things about Kellogg Dog Park and couldn't wait to bring my furry friend for a playdate. The park definitely lived up to its reputation - the size was perfect for both small and large dogs, and the fact that they can play together is a bonus. The lights are a huge plus for those evening visits, and it was reassuring to see many other dog owners around.

However, there is one major issue that brought my rating down. Despite the friendly atmosphere, there were a few Dog Park Nazis roaming around. You know, those nosy and judgmental individuals who love to point out every little ""flaw"" in your dog's behavior. But let's not let them spoil the fun - just brush them off and carry on enjoying the park.

The real problem lies with the irresponsible dog owners who don't clean up after their pets. The back side of the hill is a prime example of this - it's disgusting and definitely not a sight you want to see while enjoying a peaceful walk with your pup. It's such a shame that the park has to suffer because of a few inconsiderate individuals.

Overall, Kellogg Dog Park is a great spot for some quality playtime with your furry friend. Just make sure to watch where you step and ignore the Dog Park Nazis - trust me, it's worth it. And don't forget to bring some bags to clean up after your dog - let's keep this park clean and enjoyable for everyone!"

This hotel is definitely luxurious and modernized, making for a great first impression. During our stay, we opted for a suite and a studio to take advantage of the different room layouts. The suite was huge, almost too spacious as I struggled to find my boyfriend in another part of the room. The living room was equipped with an L-shaped couch and single chairs, perfect for lounging and watching TV. The desk area was convenient for any work that needed to be done. We were impressed by the full kitchen and large fridge/freezer combination. And let's not forget about the bathroom - the shower had not one, not two, but three shower heads! The bedroom was cozy and the bed was incredibly comfortable. And to top it off, there was a jacuzzi tub in front of the balcony, which extended around the entire suite. We loved how the suite was designed in a way where each area could be closed off for more privacy. The studio was perfect for me, with a cozy bedroom and a sectioned off living area. Though it was smaller in size, it still had everything I needed. Overall, a great stay at this hotel!"

I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, my experience fell short in every aspect. First off, let me emphasize that the only reason I am giving this establishment one star is because of their bottomless mimosas. Other than that, don't waste your time or money. \n\nI made the mistake of choosing this place for my birthday brunch. I called the day before to make a reservation but was told they don't do that. Okay, fair enough. Then I called the day of and asked to put my name on the waitlist, but again, they don't do that either. When my friends and I finally arrived, we were told it would be a two hour wait. At 10:30 in the morning. Ridiculous, I know. It's popular, I get it, but then why not offer reservations or call ahead seating? \n\nAs if the long wait wasn't bad enough, the entire place was a chaotic mess. People were packed in like sardines and it was nearly impossible to move around without a 'security' guy telling you to get out of the way or not to lean on the railing. Meanwhile, there were 6-top tables available but apparently, those were reserved for a select few. \n\nTo make matters worse, I was seated in the sun and when I tried to switch seats for some relief, I was reprimanded by the 'security' guy for ""sleeping"" even though I was clearly wide awake and just trying to cool down. It was like being in detention. \n\nThe only redeeming quality of this place was their bottomless mimosas, but even that came with a catch. You have to get there when they open, snag a table, and not even think about ordering until 10 am. Talk about a buzzkill for a birthday celebration. \n\nBased on my experience, it's clear that this place is understaffed and unprepared for busy days, like football season. Unless you enjoy cramped spaces and being treated like a prisoner, I would not recommend wasting your time or money at this establishment. Trust me, there are plenty of other options in the area."
74,"Decided to check out this pho place after some drinking and gambling.  The pho is just ok, probably average by SJ standard.  The broth could be hotter as mine was just warm.  Frankly, I get suspicious when the broth isn't steaming hot.   Anyhow, I just ate it and thought to myself, these out of towners just don't know what good pho tastes like.  I probably won't return, but I can now say I've been here and it's way over-rated."
75,"I haven't been to Thee Pitts again in a while, but I wanted to give it a review now as I intend to return soon.\n\nHad I reviewed this place a few years ago, upon my first couple of visits, I would have rated it a 4 or 5 but based on my last experience I'm going to have to take it down to a 3.  What many recent reviewers have shared was my experience too; dry and/or cold ribs (beef and pork) and brisket.  The pulled pork sandwich has always been a real pleaser, but as of late all of the barbecue I've eaten has lacked the smokiness all good barbecue should convey.\n\nFrom my most recent experience and the most recent reviews, I fear the proprietors may have either stopped caring or are resting on the laurels of their exposure on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives.  I'll be returning sometime in the not too distant future for a final verdict."
76,"Should not have the word Phoenix in it's name, because it is nowhere near Phoenix!  It's a fucking hour away!  Also had very bad luck with Allegiant Airlines, as both my flight in and out were 90 minutes late.  I also experienced a gate agent who, in the spirit of spring training, was a major league bitch.  No carry-on food available inside the security area either, only dine in.  I won't fly back into Mesa unless it's absolutely necessary."

I was highly disappointed with my experience at this establishment. Despite coming in during happy hour, the service was far from happy. The bartender seemed to have an arrogant attitude and was completely uninterested in serving me. After finally getting his attention, I asked if they had champagne and his response was nothing short of snarky. This type of behavior continued throughout my time at the bar, making it an unpleasant and uncomfortable experience. I can confidently say that I will never be returning to this establishment. The lack of customer service and unwelcoming atmosphere is enough to drive anyone away. I would highly recommend finding another place to grab a drink. Trust me, it's not worth the hassle."
78,"We have traveled the world and this has to be the most bizarre hotel we have ever stayed at!!!\nIf you are 21-25 and only interested in looking at boobs, butts and spandex then you will think this is a great party hotel.......when you are in your fifties and over the \""valley girl\"" stage or have something other to discuss than last nights conquests this is NOT the place for you. The hotel is filled with rich little kids that can afford to throw money away......everyone parades around the hotel in their bathing suit or spandex that is tighter than a wetsuit with all bodily parts hanging out. They come out of the taxi or limo like this rolling a suitcase behind them. Limos advertising \""Larry Flint\"" pull through the hotel and drop off girls......the rest look like paid escorts or hookers or they wouldn't have been hanging out with the guys they were with. I got drinks spilled on my feet in the elevator........the air conditioning in the room would never cool it down with one tiny vent on the far side of the room and 105 degree weather outside.....come Sunday at checkout time and you are on a high floor you can't get any elevator...had to go up to go down.......drinks are ridiculous prices.......I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. But if you are just wanting to go to get drunk and \""hook up\"" for the weekend, then this is the RIGHT place for you!! And then to top it off, watch your bill......they will add on things from the mini bar that you never even looked at!!!  If you are a real adult GO elsewhere. I will say the staff with polite and the interior decorations were nice. I have no desire to ever stay at a 5-star hotel again."

My friends and I decided to check out this spot for some chicken wings, as we heard they had pretty good ones. However, our excitement quickly turned to disappointment when we experienced the less-than-stellar service. The server, who initially sounded cheerful when I called to place a take-out order, suddenly became uninterested when I mentioned the order was for take-out. And when I asked about the sides that came with the wings, she replied with a lackluster ""I guess..."". Um, shouldn't you be more knowledgeable about the menu? Or at least ask someone who is? But it didn't stop there. When I went to pick up my order, they had somehow lost it and I had to wait another 15 minutes. Needless to say, by the time I received my food, my appetite had vanished, both for the food and the service. It's a shame because the wings were actually pretty good, but the subpar service definitely puts a damper on the dining experience. Here's hoping they work on improving their customer service skills.

80,"DO NOT COME HERE! You're risking your health!\n\nI had been here before about a year ago and everything was fine. It's close to my place so I didn't drive to my normal nail place and now I wish I had. At first, everything seemed fine. \n\nThen I noticed the woman doing my nails was on the phone. She picked up the phone twice during my pedicure and talked for at least five minutes each time. That's rude, but what will make me never come here again is what happened next. \n\nI was reading a magazine when she started scrapping my feet for rough spots. Everything seemed normal until I looked up and realized she was using a CHEESE GRATER to scrape my feet. I was in such disbelief I even asked her if that was a cheese grater. She laughed and said something in another language. By then, she was already done and there was nothing I could do. \n\nTo top it off, I saw her put it away in drawer without sterilizing it, which can only lead me to believe she didn't disinfect it before using it on me. \n\nI took pictures of the cheese grater and am filing a compliant with Nevada State Board of Cosmetology."
81,"You can get good happy hour specials here. Only spent about $20 for four draft beers, a platter of wings and some pretzel bites. Service was really good. Food was just ok. Good place to watch a game. They will change just about any tv you want to something you wanna watch."
82,"Things have gone from bad to worse at this gym.  Several cardio machines are against a huge window, and are impossible to use in the afternoon due to the searing sun.  Windowshade anyone?

Yet they continue to sell memberships and bring in more people...\nI would not recommend that anyone join this gym - too expensive for a place with no basketball court, no racquetball courts, and limited weight machines."

My friends and I were in the mood for some sushi, so we decided to check out this highly rated spot. After hearing all the hype, I had high expectations for the food. However, I have to say, I was a bit let down. Yes, the food was definitely good, but it wasn't mind-blowing. And for the price we paid, I expected to leave feeling more than just slightly satisfied.

Let's start with the positives - the service was great. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. The food was beautifully presented and tasted fresh. The sashimi and shrimp were standout dishes, and the lettuce wrapped black cod was truly melt-in-your-mouth delicious. And let's not forget about the dessert - the rhubarb molten love was to die for.

But here's where things took a turn. The prices. Sticker shock is an understatement. And while I didn't personally pay for the meal, I couldn't help but feel a little guilty knowing how much my friends had to shell out for this dinner. And for what? We left feeling a bit hungry. So much for a satisfying meal.

While the food quality was definitely there, I can't justify paying such high prices for what is essentially a basic sushi restaurant. The decor also left something to be desired - yes, it's classy but a bit too dark for my taste. And can we talk about how they could really use some live fish tanks in there? That would add some much-needed color to the place.

In short, while the food was good, it was not worth the steep prices. I would much rather go to a cheaper sushi spot and get my money's worth. So unless you're willing to splurge for a decent meal and don't mind a bland dining room, I suggest looking elsewhere for your sushi fix. "

We decided to check out this dive bar and were excited to try some of their infamous ""ass juice"" shots. The ambiance of the bar definitely lived up to its dive bar reputation, but unfortunately, the drink did not. It was definitely ass-y, just as the name suggests, but not in a good way. Thankfully, we were able to wash it down with some PBR and the chaotic atmosphere of a game of pool and live entertainment. Surprisingly, the bar was not as smoky as we thought it would be, thanks to the open door and fans.

As for the food, we ordered some buffalo wings as an appetizer and they were just okay. But things took a turn for the worse with our main dishes. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were accompanied by beans and salsa, but it was nothing special. My partner tried their teriyaki burger and was not impressed. The bread was soggy and difficult to eat, forcing him to use a fork and knife. The one saving grace was the endless supply of thick and fresh potato fries, which we thoroughly enjoyed.

In the end, we decided to splurge on dessert and tried the mudslide. The combination of mocha and chocolate ice cream pie was a definite yum. But unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the mediocre food and drinks. Overall, if you're just looking for a cheap and chaotic night out, this dive bar is perfect for you. But if you're expecting anything more, you might want to lower your expectations."
85,Stopped by yesterday (9/30) on the way hope from a long trip.  Wished we'd have kept going.  The place was literally empty so we figured the service would be good and the food tasty.  I ordered a bacon avacado cheese burger which was a huge dissapointment.  Seemed to take a while to get to the table (even with a near empty restaurant) and when it did the fries that accompanied it were burnt (some even black) and shrivelled up.  In other words the dregs that had been setting around for a while and they were cold.  The server seemed embarrased and said he was going to bring fresh fries but he never returned with them.  If he was that embarrassed he should have never brought them in the first place!!!!  The burger was somewhat tastless and it wasn't even luke warm.  Have been to other Mimi's so this should have been a good bet.  NOT!  Doubt I'll never return.
86,"\n\nThe staff was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. The only downside was that it was a bit noisy because it's a popular spot. Definitely will be coming back!

I stumbled upon this little gem on a Saturday night when most places were closed. The convenience of the late hours was a plus, and I quickly saw that the friendly staff and enchanting atmosphere were also major selling points. But let's get to the food - the pizza was incredible! I couldn't resist and ended up devouring the whole pie by myself. The crepes also looked amazing, but unfortunately, I was already too full. The only downside to this popular spot was the noise level, but that's to be expected. Overall, I would definitely come back for another visit."
87,"Our party of three arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and we were promptly seated... when the greeter managed to look up and actually greet us.\n\nHowever, our waitress was wonderful; engaging and knowledgeable.  She was able to talk about the wine we selected in a way that was helpful and pretty accurate.  She shared with us that she had lived in Spain (we ordered a Spanish wine) and her recommendations were appreciated.  It was nice rapport without feeling forced.\n\nWe ordered the cheese curds in the vodka batter and they were pretty good; light and crispy and greasy.  We also ordered the soft pretzel with three different kinds of mustard and Widmer's cheese spread.  The cheese was to die for, the mustards were great.\n\nI ordered the Pork3:  chili braised pork shoulder, pickled vegetables, rice, and leaf lettuce;  Udon noodle bowl with glazed pork belly and sugar snap peas;  smoked pork spare ribs with Korean mustard sauce, cucumber salad.  Pretty good.  The spare ribs were... well, spare.  Very small meat cuts on the ribs, very hard to bite into.  The pork belly was good.  The small ramen bowl was gone much too quickly and there were no promised peas in my bowl.  The braised pork shoulder tasted delicious but I think some sort of sauce could have helped texturally; it was too much like eating a Big League Chew wad of shredded pork.  The pickled veggies were great.\n\nMy dining partners ordered the gnocchi and the Graze burger.\n\nSide note:  It would be nice if there was a way to tell by looking at the menu exactly where the food is coming from.  Are the mussels actually local?\n\nThe reviews about the noise level in this restaurant are accurate.  We had to leave eventually in order to hear each other talk.  I do not think the Graze/L'etoile comparison is necessarily a fair one.  I had one of the most amazing meals of my life at L'etoile and Graze has a totally different menu and technique.\n\nLastly, I wish there was an easy way to let Graze know that their domain name is missing the letter \""E\"" when you search for them on Google.  Drives me nuts. ;-)"
88,"Wife and I haven't been to this restaurant for over 10+ years --- as I remember, it was because the food was mediocre and there are better Cantonese restaurants in the area.  But we had a restaurant.com certificate -- $25 worth of food for $3.00 so we decided to try again.  I cannot figure out how this restaurant.com thing works for the establishments.....maybe hoping for repeat business?  But what if you keep buying the coupons?  Oh well, it must work or restaurants wouldn't participate now, would they?\n\nWell this trip the restaurant probably did not lose money on us.  We spent over $60 on food and a couple of beers.  With tax and tip the bill was slightly over $80 and with the $25 coupon, I paid $55.\n\nWe had half a roast duck (mediocre-dry and not crispy); mapo tofu (good); salt and pepper shrimps and salt and pepper pork chops (both dishes prepared in the same fashion-good sized serving but the batter was a little thick and chewy); Hong Kong style pork chow mein (this was very good); and finally Mongolian beef (average at best-spice level was low and not very tasty).  The dishes were all probably priced at least $1.00 each higher than other comparable places.\n\nSo our conclusion is that with the coupon, the value is OK.  But without the coupon, it is not worth the price for the quality of the food.  In fact, both my wife and I agreed that we would rather pay the price to get better quality food.  Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad; just not very good.\n\nLastly, we agree with one other yelper -- the place was very cold.  They need to up the heating in the place."

Despite the hype and popularity surrounding this buffet, my experience was far from satisfactory. My friend and I went on a Saturday evening in December and had to wait in line for over an hour, only to be disappointed by the high price of $50 per person with a Total Rewards discount. While many people compare this buffet to the famous Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan, I have to say that I was unimpressed. The variety of food options was impressive, but the quality and taste fell short. As someone who always tries a little bit of everything at a buffet, I was underwhelmed by the overall flavor and presentation of the food. The decor and furniture were nice, but unfortunately, the food did not match up. I may consider returning only if a friend insists, but otherwise, I would not choose to dine here again. Even some of the highly anticipated items, like the corn on the cob and BBQ ribs, were mediocre at best. The Alaskan king crab legs were a major disappointment, as they were overcooked and tough. I found myself missing the delicious crab legs at M buffet. However, there were a few highlights, such as the well-seasoned and juicy Italian meatball and the perfectly cooked and seasoned shrimp. The desserts were also decent, but nothing compared to the ones at M buffet or Wynn buffet. Overall, this buffet may be popular, but it does not live up to the hype and definitely falls short compared to other top-notch buffets in Las Vegas."

I have been a loyal customer of this pizza joint for over a decade. The old owner, Jimmy, always provided top-notch service and the pizza was unbeatable. However, since the new owners took over, the service has gone downhill and the food is simply terrible. It's a shame to see this once beloved spot turn into a dump.

During my recent visit, I walked in with high hopes, hoping to be transported back to the days when this place was a legend. But instead, I was met with rude and inconsiderate staff. The food was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. I was so disappointed that I couldn't resist telling the owners personally how much their restaurant has deteriorated under their management.

My wife and I have decided that we will never set foot in this place again. It's really a shame to see what used to be a great business turn into such a disappointment. I would advise all potential customers to stay far, far away. Don't waste your time or money on this once beloved establishment, it's just not worth it anymore. Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else for your pizza fix."
92,"Okay, I came to this place a lot for karaoke last year. It was fun cause I could take off my shirt and stuff and no one cared. They also had bar bingo which was a sure fire way to get drunk for under $15. \nRecently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \""bar pizza\"". Pizza that is doey and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the day there is nothing special or redeeming about it. Think of Pizza Hut or frozen pizza you may purchase at a grocery store.\nI gave the pizza another try. Perhaps I was wrong. No, it was the same doey, bar pizza. Not amazing by any standards. I asked the pizza mAker about the inspiration behind their pizza, his response \""I don't know... My mom bought a lot of tombstone when we were kids\"".\nAside from this pizza with a bad personality, the beer is way over priced, they don't even serve straub or pbr. The bartender told me they \""we're trying to get rid of that crowd\"". The crowd however added to the subpar experience. The best I can describe it is Bloomfield's jersey shore. \nIn conclusion, if you wanna eat wack pizza, pay to much for beer while being surrounded by douches Caliente  is the place for you! The best thing this place can offer is they DO serve pizza till 2 pm."

My friend and I chose this hotel for our Labor Day weekend getaway, attracted by its beautiful exterior and contemporary decor. The lobby and surrounding architecture definitely lived up to our expectations. However, our stay quickly became inconvenient when we realized that neither WiFi nor continental breakfast were included in the already pricey room rate (unlike the neighboring Embassy Suites). And to make matters worse, the hotel only offers free WiFi for one hour in the lobby. As seasoned travelers, we have come to expect complimentary WiFi at all hotels, regardless of their price range. This was a major disappointment for us. 

While the rooms were clean and spacious, the inconvenience of limited WiFi and lack of breakfast options made our stay less enjoyable. We have stayed in numerous hotels across the United States, both high-end and budget, and we have never had to pay extra for basic amenities like WiFi. We ultimately felt like we were being nickel-and-dimed at this hotel.

In conclusion, while the hotel may be beautiful, the added fees for WiFi and breakfast just aren't worth it. We recommend staying elsewhere, where these amenities are included in the room rate. Don't let the attractive exterior and lobby fool you, there are better options out there."

Alright, I have some thoughts on this place. First of all, it's supposed to be a hostel, which usually means budget-friendly accommodations and amenities. So when I heard they had a restaurant, I was expecting some pretty affordable options. But let me tell you, the prices here were anything but budget-friendly. I ended up paying \u00a310 for a mediocre breakfast, and that's not exactly what I was hoping for. 

Let's start with the pancakes, shall we? I opted for a stack of three, thinking that would fill me up nicely. But these were not your average pancakes. In fact, they were more like silver dollar pancakes. And I know I'm in the UK, but I swear these cost more than 50 pence each. And don't even get me started on the syrup situation. I think they tried to pass off some honey as syrup, and even then, they didn't give me nearly enough to cover my three tiny pancakes. Disappointing to say the least.

But that's not even the half of it. When I saw the Croque Madame on the menu, I thought it would be a safe bet. I mean, how can you mess up a sandwich, right? Well, let's just say this one didn't impress me in the slightest. The bread was soggy and the ham was practically non-existent. And for what I paid, I was expecting something a little more extravagant than just two slices of bread with some cheese and ham in the middle. 

I will give the servers credit though, they were friendly and the place had a good atmosphere. And I guess I can't speak for the hostel part, but as far as the restaurant goes, I definitely won't be coming back. Sorry, but my American wallet just can't handle dropping that kind of money on a very average breakfast."

I recently dined at this restaurant for lunch and my experience was not what I had hoped for. While the Asian nachos were indeed delicious as others have raved about, the rest of our meal left much to be desired. My friend ordered the Pad Thai noodles and found them to be just okay, leaving quite a bit on her plate despite the large portion. As for my California roll, it was dry and lacked the usual tastiness I expect from sushi. In fact, I ended up leaving a few pieces on my plate, which is something I have never done before. While we were both still a bit hungry, we didn't want to take the risk of trying something else on the menu. 

Aside from the disappointing food, the service also left something to be desired. While our glasses were kept full, our waitress seemed to disappear when we needed to pay. And to top it off, she charged the wrong credit card for each of our tabs, which she did eventually correct. Overall, our experience was not up to par and I'm not sure if I would be willing to give this place another chance. The service may have been good, but the lackluster food and mishaps with the bill make me question whether this is a place I would want to dine at again. Unfortunately, I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone."

The thrift store is definitely a hidden gem in this area. I was blown away by their unbeatable prices and clean, organized store layout. It seriously reminded me of a high-end department store, but without the high-end price tags. I could spend hours here just browsing through their amazing selection. And the staff were so helpful and friendly, they really made the shopping experience even better. The dressing rooms and bathrooms were also surprisingly clean, which is a major plus. I only have one regret - not discovering this place sooner! I used to live in Arizona where there were also Deseret locations, and now I can't help but feel like I missed out on something amazing. Don't make the same mistake I did, check out this thrift store and prepare to be amazed."
97,"Decently priced, moderate wait, and tasty food.\n\nWe got the buffet around 2pm, and stayed for about 3 hours (including the 1 hour wait to be seated) wandering the sm\u00f6rgsbord of international cuisine at the Rio.\n\nI was impressed with the number of offerings, and the ones of notable mention were:\n\n- Noodle soup bar, (the udon was pretty good)\n- Gelato station\n- Assortment of desserts (mini eclairs! moussecake! red velvet cake!)\n- King crab legs station\n- Cocktail shrimp station (next to the crab)\n\nAnd the rest was decent, but forgettable.

98,I don't know why everyone is rating this buffet so low. I went for breakfast during the week and it was good. I had a little of everything but my favorite was chicken fried steak topped with gravy. This wasn't a large buffet so not much to choose from but the food is yummy and the prices are decent. I think it was $15/ea for breakfast.

During our stay at GV resort, my wife and I were excited to try out Kokomo's for dinner. We had heard good things about the restaurant and it seemed like the perfect spot to grab a bite before the Beatles Love Cirque performance. However, our experience at Kokomo's was far from satisfying. To start off, it took 20 minutes for us to receive our drinks, which were not even made properly. We decided to overlook this and hope that the food would make up for it. Unfortunately, that was not the case. My wife's order never even made it to the kitchen, and my dish was served cold. The side that we ordered, the broccoli and cauliflower au gratin, was also a disappointment. It consisted of only 4 small pieces of vegetables drowned in cheese sauce and topped with a chunk of brie cheese. And let's not forget the lobster bisque which was nothing but cream with no trace of lobster, and yet it was priced at a staggering $18! To make matters worse, my wife's steak, which was supposed to be cooked medium rare, came out well done. When we brought these issues to our server's attention, she seemed clueless and unable to handle the situation. Despite our complaints, the only thing the restaurant did was take off the steak and side from our bill. And to add insult to injury, the total still came out to be over $100! We were appalled by the overpriced and subpar food, as well as the lack of competence from our server. Needless to say, we will never be returning to Kokomo's and we do not recommend it to anyone else. What a disappointment."

Although my experience at Seksun was just average, I have some mixed feelings about it. First off, let's talk about the atmosphere. I went on a Friday night at 6pm and the place was completely empty. Usually, that's a red flag for a restaurant, but I decided to give it a chance. The conveyor belt was a unique touch, but I have to say the selection was pretty limited. The same 10 dishes kept going around and around, compared to the 6 minute loop I was used to at a similar restaurant in Oregon, this one felt a bit short.

Now, let's talk about the food. I ordered some hamachi sashimi, which was decent but not worth the price. I also got the fried veggie spring rolls, which were tasty but nothing special. To my disappointment, the selection on the conveyor belt was so limited that I ended up ordering 2 spicy hand rolls from the menu. And that's where the real problem lies - the prices are quite high for what you actually get.

On top of that, I felt a bit uncomfortable while I was there. The servers and staff were friendly enough when I first arrived, but I didn't get that same feeling when I was leaving. It's frustrating when businesses like this don't prioritize customer satisfaction. And to add insult to injury, I specifically asked for a gloss to be put on my hair, but it turns out the stylist didn't do it. When I asked about it, the front desk staff didn't seem to care at all. And to make matters worse, my hair faded within just 2 and a half weeks.

Overall, my experience at Seksun was just ok. The prices are high for what you get, the atmosphere was lacking, and the customer service left something to be desired. I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon."

Our group had a bit of an encounter with one of the employees, Jackie, during our visit to this fitness center. We were trying to retrieve a lost membership card, and she seemed disinterested as she was busy on a personal phone call. When we finally had her attention, she was rude and disrespectful, using vulgar language towards us. It was quite a disappointment to experience such unprofessional behavior. Despite this interaction, the facilities and equipment were satisfactory. Perhaps it would be best to avoid contact with Jackie if possible. On a positive note, the manager was very understanding and helpful in resolving the situation. Next time, we might consider trying out a different fitness center to avoid any unpleasant encounters."

I was excited to go back to this restaurant after having such a great experience with their fish and chips on my previous visit. However, my second time was a completely different story. I made the mistake of ordering the ""chicken"" quesadilla and was extremely disappointed to find that there was no chicken in it at all. I immediately brought it to the attention of my waitress who promised to send the manager over. But despite waiting for his arrival, he never showed. 

When it was time to pay the bill, my husband mentioned the issue to the cashier. The manager then came over and instead of apologizing, he accused us of lying about the missing chicken. He claimed that even though there wasn't much chicken in it, it was still there. But how could he know without even taking a look at it? His attitude was extremely insulting and unacceptable. 

Needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment. The food is not good enough to endure such poor service and being overcharged for food that was not even delivered. Save yourself the trouble and go to a different restaurant with better quality and customer service."
103,"I came here as part of a bachelorette VIP party deal. I didn't set up the deal, but as a part of the package, we got a chef selection meal in the lounge/bar area of Ago. \n\nIn comparison to the decor of the rest of the Hard Rock Hotel - this place was really nice. Very modern and elegant. I really liked the look and feel of the restaurant. Our group of nine sat in the lounge area, which was cozy. No complaints about the decor. \n\nOn to the food. We were served three courses - salad, pasta and pizza. And there was nothing really memorable about each meal. The salad was just your run of the meal salad with Italian dressing. The pasta was bow-tie pasta with a pink sauce. And again, it was just OK. Nothing special. I probably should have asked for some Parmesan cheese to go with it. But therein lies another problem.....why did no one ask me if I wanted some Parmesan cheese?!?! The place was not busy on Friday night. And we got there at, what 8pm. There was hardly anyone in the dining room. Maybe everyone else in Vegas eats really late. Whatever. On to the pizza - just a very generic run of the mill cheese pizza. \n\nNow reader - I know what you are thinking....had a sat down and had a regular meal, I probably would have been happy with it. Judging by the Yelp reviews, the place serves some mighty tasty sounding Italian food. But, I have to be impartial and judge on my experience and that I have experienced way better lounge/bar food. Now, the $64 dollar question - whether I would go back. Probably not - if I was in Vegas again, I don't see myself going out of my way to eat here."

My husband and I stopped by Swaddee on a whim last weekend for dinner. We used to live by their Chandler location and loved it, so we were excited to see one in our new neighborhood. However, our experience was a bit of a letdown. The pad thai was mushy and seemed like it had been sitting for awhile, and the portion size was much smaller compared to the Chandler location. Plus, they didn't include nearly enough shrimp, which was disappointing. We also ordered the Panang curry, which we always loved at the Chandler store, but this time it was loaded with onions and the beef was tough and chewy. It just didn't compare to what we were used to. We debated giving it one star, but ultimately decided on two since the staff was friendly and the overall experience wasn't horrible. However, this disappointment means we'll have to find a new Thai place to become our new ""local favorite."""
105,"Let me start by saying I'm a Travel Agent and see many hotels on site inspections so i always keep an open mind on what i see but the big thing for me is always CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The room we stayed in was in the Monaco Tower which is newly decorated and very nice. The hotel itself is yes, a little run down but that's to be expected from one of the older hotels in Vegas. \n\nThe issue I am having currently is with the Customer Service at the Riviera Hotel & Casino. My Nephew (15 yrs. old) was staying w/ us in the room and he has Juvenile Diabetes. I specifically remember him bringing his supplies (diabetic needles, insulin, etc.) which by the way he keeps in a shoe box..boys..he he...bringing it to our room and setting it on the table Friday night. Saturday Morning he ate breakfast, took a shot, and we left the room to venture out for the day. Later on when we returned to the room we noticed that when it was time to eat dinner that we could not find the \""shoebox\"" in the room. We looked everywhere!\nIt was gone so we took the next step to running around town to find a pharmacy that had the supplies we needed. After 2 hrs of running around Vegas we got the insulin and needles to give him a shot after we ate. I kept the receipts and brought it down the next morning when I went to check out. \n\nI spoke to the manager at check out and felt really bad but said that I would have to file a report at security. I did as requested and they gave me the Risk Manager's (La Cretia Evans) card and said she would call me on Monday. I never heard back from anyone at the Riviera hotel so I called them a few days later in which they had explained to me that after looking into this incident and speaking w/ the maid that they are not held responsible for this matter and there is nothing else they can do. \n\nToo bad for them as i will NEVER recommend this hotel again!"

The atmosphere at this restaurant is definitely one-of-a-kind, with colorful decor and an interesting mix of dolls and clowns scattered throughout. The customer service is also top-notch, with the staff always going above and beyond to make sure our experience is enjoyable. Our glasses are never empty, thanks to the ninja-like buss boys who are always ready to refill. Plus, who can resist tableside guacamole? It's a great touch that allows you to customize the spiciness level.

However, despite these positives, there are a few things that bring this restaurant down for me. The first is the chips, salsa, and bean dip that come out before the meal. While they are tasty, they seem to be more of a distraction than anything. And although the menu offers a variety of dishes, their fajitas are the standout for me. The homemade tortillas truly elevate the dish, but I wish there were more options for protein. Additionally, while the fideo soup is a nice touch, I find myself adding salsa to give it a little more flavor. 

And while the staff is overall great, it can get a bit uncomfortable when celebrating a birthday. The bilingual singing is a nice gesture, but it can also feel a bit forced and performative. Plus, with the already loud and bustling atmosphere, the singing can sometimes be hard to hear.

All in all, this restaurant has its pros and cons. I would recommend coming here for a fun and lively dining experience, but don't expect to be blown away by the food. And if you're craving a Harris Teeter, I suggest heading to the one further south. It definitely puts this one to shame."
107,"Works in a pinch because they're open 24 hours, but it should be a last resort type of option. If you have exhausted all other choices, if nothing is open, if you are unable to walk across the street to get a slice of pizza, or if you are generally afraid of the dark, then and only then, should you have a meal here.\n\nI'm guilty of eating here a few times cause I can skip the line with my player's status and I'm lazy. But food is pricey for what you get and they can't cook a steak properly.  I will say the bread service is the best part, but that's not a good thing.\n\nI'm not even gonna lie, I'll probably eat here again.  Probably a few times.  But I'll live with the crap, and feel good about it. Thanks, Coach Ditka."
108,"I saw this place the other day when I was at GNC next door.  Sign said it was going to open on the 21st so I went in for lunch today.\n\nI had a build your own 1/3lb burger.  Butter bun, cheddar, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle.  It was an ok burger.  The veggies were fresh and crisp.  The meat was sort of thin and cooked well and was larger in diameter than the bun.  I also had a strawberry shake which was pretty good.  Over all the food was good enough I would stop in again if I was in the area over the other options for a burger at that intersection.  But not good enough to go across town for.\n\nThey did a complete gut and remodel of the space which previously housed a deli.  They also added a railed off patio area.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  They are fast casual and the food came out fairly quick.  The sandwiches are served open with the hot stuff one 1/2 the bun and the cold stuff on the other half so everything is still fresh when you get it.  They came to check on me part way through the meal and cleared my plate almost as soon as I finished my burger.  They seemed pretty well versed in what to do for a place that has only been open 3 days.  They were not very busy but no place I ate lunch this week was."

I was so disappointed with my visit to this brunch spot. Despite hearing rave reviews, my experience was anything but enjoyable. First off, I don't mind waiting in line for a good brunch, but having to order at the counter and then awkwardly wait at a table with my silverware and order number in hand was a major turn off. Is it too much to ask for the whole experience to occur while seated? And don't even get me started on the food. The brioche french toast was not only cold, but it had a strange taste like they tried to infuse it with orange but ended up using rancid juice. Gross. And to top it off, they ran out of coffee, leaving me parched for a good half hour. The only saving grace was the duck confit hash, but let's be real, how can you go wrong with anything fried in duck fat? Overall, a huge disappointment and I can't believe they have such a good reputation. Trust me, save your money and find a better brunch spot."

My best friend and I were so excited for our long-awaited trip to Vegas and decided to stay at the Flamingo. The prices seemed reasonable and the pictures online made the hotel look great, so I went ahead and booked our stay. However, upon arrival, our experience took a turn for the worse.

The lobby was bustling with people and looked impressive, giving us high hopes for our stay. The check-in process was quick and the staff member was nice, but things quickly went downhill from there. The room we were given looked small but decent at first glance. However, upon closer inspection, we noticed that it was dirty, dusty, and overall old. The bathroom was tiny and the lights were corroded and falling apart. To make matters worse, the cover to the bathroom vanity was completely gross and fell off easily. The beds had a thin sheet over what seemed to be a worn-out fleece blanket, and another sheet on top. This was definitely not the standard of cleanliness we were expecting.

To add to our disappointment, we were charged an additional $300 that was never discussed or approved. When I brought this up to the supervisor, they said it would take 5-10 business days to get our money back. This was never mentioned during check-in and was a huge inconvenience. Our allergies were also triggered due to the amount of dust and grime in the room. We even overheard another guest complaining about their room having urine all over the bathroom seat upon arrival. It was disheartening to think we were not the only ones having a less-than-pleasant experience.

I understand that hotels can become outdated, but when they are also dirty and poorly maintained, it becomes a major issue. This was by far the most disappointing stay I have had in Vegas, and I have stayed in some budget motels that were cleaner. Overall, our stay at the Flamingo was highly underwhelming and I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and clean hotel experience."

During my last visit to this establishment, I decided to take in some of the local nightlife and ended up at this bar. The atmosphere was lively and the drinks were affordable, so I was looking forward to a fun night out. However, my experience quickly took a turn for the worse when I ordered some food. As a warning, I must say that the food here is not all that great, and it's more of just a selection of small appetizers. But what really disappointed me was when I received my seared Ahi dish and found that it was completely inedible. The quality was extremely poor and the taste was just not up to par. I was extremely disappointed, especially since I had been a regular customer for a while now. I should have known better than to order food here. Lesson learned: stick to just drinks at this place. And speaking of drinks, I also noticed that some of them were watered down. I alerted the staff and they were nice enough to rectify the issue, but still, it's not something I would expect from a bar that prides itself on cheap drinks. Overall, my most recent visit was a terrible experience. It's a shame that a bar with such potential can let its customers down with such lousy food and drinks. Don't waste your time or money here."
112,"Nitaya Thai is a good Thai restaurant. The serving staff is always incredibly friendly but the food is sort of average at best.

I recently tried out The Rusty Nail in Bellevue and I have to say, my experience was pretty average. Don't get me wrong, the service was friendly and the atmosphere was cozy, but the food was nothing special. I ordered the burger and it was decent, but definitely nothing to write home about. It seemed like they used pre-made/frozen patties instead of fresh ground beef. I also tried a bite of my friend's meatloaf and it was just okay. I could tell it was made from frozen meat and not made from scratch. \n\nThe menu had a decent variety of options, but everything seemed like it came straight from the Sysco truck. And while I appreciate the effort to make the food seem fresher, it didn't really impress me. Plus, it was a little overpriced for what we got. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice and cozy, but I couldn't help but be distracted by the multiple TVs playing sports. Can we have at least one channel that doesn't have a game on? Also, the fact that they don't take credit cards was a bit inconvenient. Good thing I had my checkbook with me. \n\nOverall, The Rusty Nail is a decent neighborhood spot for a quick bite, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. Save your money and try one of the other restaurants in the area that offer better quality food. Trust me, there are plenty of other options."
114,"What What?.?.?.... No jalapenos?!?!?!?\n \nWhat kinda joint is this. well it's flavorless, at least thats my take. The Burrittos Blah! The Tacos Blah! The Nachos Blah! All eiether had NO flavor or The Flavor was off. Its a shame to fill a thin soggy tortilla with 80 cents worth of ingredients and wrap it in such a thin piece of foil that it splits and leaks out of the bag, and charge 8 bucks for it! especially when its as sad as these!!!\n \nI tried it twice and have to pull the plug. My wallet will never again see the light of day in a place like this.\n\nI will say the staff has always been friendly though."
115,"I may have caught them on a bad day but... Overall, I have to say this place gets a tentative thumbs down from me. The food itself is decent. Nothing spectacular, but somewhat tasty (I did enjoy their fried okra).\n\nThe problem I have is their service. I think it stems from the fact that they only have ONE cash register to take orders. The person behind that register was extremely slow. In addition, I didn't even get one of the side dishes I ordered! I didn't realize until I got back to work (I took it to go). Fortunately, the place is on my way home, so I stopped by again. They did give me my side dish and I ordered an extra pulled pork sandwich; it had no BBQ sauce on it!\n\nSo for me, that's three strikes. They are kind of minor, but enough for me to leave with a figurative bad taste in my mouth."
116,"Not sure about this place. I have eaten here before and it was decent. However, tried to have lunch with the family on Sat, 3/10/12 and the place was closed at 11:30 am.

Not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed.\n\nWent accross the street to the Queen City BBQ and had a very nice lunch."

I was excited to try this place for the first time with a friend, but it left much to be desired. The food was mediocre at best, with my Alaska roll missing a crucial ingredient - avocado. To make matters worse, my friend's food took a whopping 45 minutes to come out, leaving me to eat alone while he watched. And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I found a dead beetle in my dessert. Appalled and disgusted, I had to excuse myself to the restroom while my friend brought it to the attention of the staff. But all we received was a half-hearted ""I'm sorry"" and no compensation for the revolting experience. As someone who works in the restaurant industry, I know how important it is to handle situations like this with care and understanding. But instead, we were ignored and avoided for the rest of our time there. Needless to say, I will never be returning to this establishment, and I'm disappointed to hear that even my friend, a regular, is now boycotting it as well. Save yourself the disappointment and find somewhere else to eat. Trust me, you'll thank me later."

I came to this restaurant with high hopes, after all it had a catchy name and was located in the heart of Vegas. However, my experience was nothing short of disappointing. My colleagues and I decided to call the restaurant to make sure we didn't need a reservation - a reasonable request considering it was almost 23:00 at night. The person on the phone reassured us that no reservation was needed and we headed over right away. 

Upon arrival, we were met with rude and unprofessional staff who informed us that the kitchen was closed. This was extremely frustrating as we had just spoken to someone who had assured us that we could come in. Not only did we have to waste money on a cab, but we wasted our time as well. It was clear that the staff had no respect for their customers' time. 

To make matters worse, the menu was extremely limited and disappointing. I ordered the menudo, hoping to at least salvage the night with a delicious meal. However, my hopes were shattered when I found out that the soup was practically floating in oil and fat. Before I could even take a spoonful, I had to skim out a quarter cup of grease. The tripe was not properly cleaned, with layers of fat still attached to them. It was revolting and unappetizing. 

To top it all off, the utensils provided were embarrassingly small. If you had ordered any dish with a large bone-in meat, good luck trying to eat it with the miniature utensils. And don't even get me started on the lack of cleanliness in the place. It was clear that this restaurant had no standards for hygiene or customer service. 

Needless to say, I did not return to this restaurant for the remainder of my trip. The attitude of the staff, combined with the unappetizing and poorly prepared food, left a sour taste in my mouth. I would not recommend this place to anyone, especially not to my colleagues who also had a bad experience. Save your money and your appetite, and skip this establishment."

The facility may look impressive from the outside, but my experience at World Class Driving left much to be desired. As a professional photographer, I was hired to capture the excitement of a company retreat where employees were rewarded with a day of driving exotic cars. However, my first impression of the place quickly turned sour. 

The cars may have looked stunning, but there were numerous issues with their maintenance. As a self-proclaimed ""car guy"", I know my way around exotic cars and was disappointed to find uneven tire treads, scratched paint, and even a broken side mirror on some of the vehicles. It was clear that maintenance was not a top priority for this establishment. 

When it was time for the tour of Lake Mead, I stayed back to take photos while my clients enjoyed the driving experience. However, I couldn't help but notice the lack of enthusiasm from the drivers. Many of them complained about the loud engine noises and the uncomfortable ride. And to make matters worse, one of my clients came back with a smeared arm from the gel mani that was supposed to be a relaxing treat. 

To top it off, the staff at World Class Driving was anything but helpful. They seemed annoyed by the complaints and offered no solutions or apologies. It was clear that customer satisfaction was not a top priority for them. I can confidently say that this will be my first and last visit to World Class Driving, and I will not be recommending it to anyone. Save your time and money and find a better driving experience elsewhere."

We decided to try this place out for dinner and were pleasantly surprised. The exterior may not look like much, but the food definitely made up for it. The atmosphere was laid-back and comfortable, perfect for a casual meal with friends.

As a seafood lover from San Francisco, I have high standards when it comes to seafood. But I have to say, this place did not disappoint. I was initially hesitant about trying seafood in Phoenix, but I was pleasantly surprised. The New England clam chowder was just the right amount of creamy and not too salty. And the fried shrimp dish was perfectly prepared. We all ordered seafood and were satisfied with our meals.

But the highlight of the meal was the Snickers cheesecake. It was the perfect balance of rich and sweet, and we couldn't get enough of it. The prices on the menu were on the higher side, but for fresh seafood, it was worth it.

The service was decent, although a bit slow. We found out that the servers have to manually compute split checks, which could explain the delay. Despite that, our waiter was friendly and made sure we were taken care of.

Overall, it was a good experience at this no-frills seafood restaurant. The focus is on the food, and they definitely deliver on that. I highly recommend trying their lobster mac n cheese, it was the best I've ever had at a restaurant. We will definitely be returning for more delicious seafood in the future."

I have to say, I had high hopes for Ninja since my first few experiences were pretty decent. But unfortunately, this time I was left disappointed. The sushi, which I used to rave about, was now lacking in flavor. It seems they've been too generous with the rice, as it was the only thing I could taste in every bite. Even the different types of seafood all had a similar taste. And don't get me started on the rolls, which had more rice than actual ingredients. I struggled to even get a good bite out of them. The overall atmosphere was still nice and intimate, but the noise level was a bit too loud this time around. The staff was as friendly as ever, but the sushi just didn't hit the mark for me. I hate to say it, but I might have to start searching for a new go-to sushi spot. "

This DMV location is a complete waste of time and energy. I went in for a simple license renewal that should have taken no more than 20 minutes, but instead spent over an hour and a half there. The wait times here are ridiculous and the employees seem to have no sense of urgency, as if they enjoy watching people suffer in their never-ending lines. The worst part is, this isn't my first time here and it certainly won't be the last because my work requires me to go to different DMV locations. I've had better luck at DMVs in other cities, but no matter what day or time I come here, it's always a nightmare. And don't even get me started on the drivers in this area - it's like they took a crash course on how NOT to drive. I do have to give credit to the employees for remaining somewhat pleasant amidst the chaos, but that's the only positive aspect of this place. Save yourself the stress and go elsewhere for your DMV needs. And for those of you thinking of coming here just because it's closer to your home, let me tell you now - it's not worth it. Take my advice and find another DMV location, unless you enjoy wasting your precious time sitting in line for hours on end. I'm Mel C. and I highly discourage anyone from coming here. "
126,"We will start with a positive.  Service is good.  Now the not good!  Went to use the restroom.  There was a female staff member holding the door open and a male staff member holding a soap refill.  Stood there for over 5 min for the the bathroom to clear out.  All the time I'm thinking \""they don't have a female that knows how to change to the soap refill so they are not closing off the bathroom!  Then it's the matter of cleanliness!  The sink in the bathroom was plugged and it looked like someone had vomited in the sink.  For all the time the employee stood at the door you'd think she would have noticed.  The fans on the patio are so filthy you wonder if the dust build-up is going to fall off on your food.  And lastly the floor in the restaurant is terrible.  It was only 5:00 o'clock and there were so many crumbs, straw wrappers, and other garbage on the floor I have to think nothing had been cleaned since they opened.

127,"Living in Anchorage, I miss the days of heading over to my favorite NorCal boba shop and getting some passionfruit green tea boba.  So when I saw this place on my trip to Vegas last week, you bet I abruptly turned the rental car into the parking lot to get a boba fix.  But alas, I was not impressed.  I asked for the passionfruit tea boba with half-sugar since I'm not a fan of super sweet drinks.  Even with half-sugar the tea was ridiculously sweet, so sweet I didn't even finish it.  The actual boba were tasty - chewy but a little firm, just the way I like them.  So I fished around to get all the bobas and threw the rest of the tea away. Sigh."
128,"I always love this place. It's been where I've spent new years,valentine's day & anniversaries. But last night I was disappointed. The pizza we had for an app was over cooked and undercooked at the same time. boo. Then the skirt steak I had for dinner was alright but the horse radish potato cake that it came with had the consistency of Elmer's glue. It ruined the meal. I want to know who tasted that and thought it was good enough to serve. Gross gross."

After a long day of gambling on the strip, my friends and I were looking for a low-key dinner spot away from the chaos. We stumbled upon this hidden gem and decided to give it a try. And boy, were we pleasantly surprised!

The menu was extensive, just like any other Thai restaurant, but the food was anything but ordinary. We tried the sea bass in ginger sauce, which was a unique twist on the traditional whole fish dish. The shrimp pad thai was also a hit, with my friend claiming it was the best she's had since her trip to Thailand. And let's not forget about the green curry, a flavorful and spicy dish perfect for satisfying our cravings.

But the real standout was their wine selection. Who knew a Thai restaurant would have such an impressive wine list? We took our waitress's recommendation on a glass of sauvignon blanc and it did not disappoint. And from the looks of it, the prices were reasonable enough for the table next to us to be ordering bottles of Cakebread like it was no big deal.

The only downside was the small portion sizes, but with a group of people, we could have ordered more dishes to try. Overall, this place is definitely worth a visit, especially if you're looking for a break from the crowds and tourist traps on the strip. We'll definitely be back on our next Vegas trip, and with a bigger group to try more of their delicious dishes and wine selection."

I have to say, my experience at 1OAK left much to be desired. From the moment I entered, I was met with a crowded and chaotic scene, with the door staff seeming more interested in chatting amongst themselves than actually welcoming guests. As my friends and I made our way to the bar, we were greeted with absurdly high drink prices that left us feeling like we were being ripped off. And let's not forget the main attraction - the performance by Adam Levine. Despite being a big fan, I was unimpressed and felt like I could have just listened to his music from home.

And while the door staff may have been friendly at times, the same cannot be said for the rest of the staff. Our server seemed annoyed and uninterested in helping us, and it took forever to get our orders. And when the drinks finally did arrive, they were nothing to write home about. Overall, my time at 1OAK felt like a mediocre experience - not quite a 4-star club, but definitely not a 3-star either.

In my opinion, there are much better options for a night out in Vegas. Next time, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. "

I've been a regular at this place for a year now and have always had mixed feelings about the owner. He's never been the friendliest person, but his staff has always been great so I kept going back. However, my recent experience has completely changed my opinion.

I decided to treat myself to a pedicure today and stopped by without an appointment. The owner was there and I asked if I could get my pedi done. He was incredibly rude and dismissive towards me. It felt like he was trying to talk down to me and I couldn't understand half of what he was saying. It was such a negative experience that I ended up leaving without even getting my pedicure done.

I was so taken aback by his behavior that I don't think I'll ever return to this place again. It's a shame because the staff is great and the place is always clean, but the owner's attitude just ruins the whole experience. As someone who supports small businesses, I'm disappointed to say that this owner won't be getting any more of my business. I hope others go elsewhere where they'll be treated with respect and positivity. We deserve to feel welcome when we pay for a service."

I recently had a mold issue in my ceiling and reached out to Chazal apartment complex for assistance. Steven from maintenance and Angela from management were both very responsive and willing to help. After removing some drywall and putting Kilz over the affected area, the mold seemed to be taken care of. However, upon further inspection, the mold had spread and it was clear that more extensive measures needed to be taken. While I appreciate their effort, it was not enough to fully address the problem.

In an effort to give them a chance, I reached out to Eli from AMS Landscape for a free estimate for some yard work. He was apologetic for not responding to my previous voicemails and quickly came out to give an estimate. I was impressed with the high quality pictures he provided and the quote seemed reasonable. However, when I asked if they could beat a competitor's price, Eli was unable to do so, citing a busy season of work. While I understand the demand for their services, I was disappointed that they were not willing to negotiate on price.

Overall, while I appreciate the effort from Chazal apartment complex and the customer service from AMS Landscape, I cannot recommend living here due to the persistent mold issue. And while I cannot fully judge their landscape work, I suggest potential customers be prepared to pay full price as they do not seem to negotiate."
133,"Got some lunch with a friend here last week. When we arrived, we had to wait 5 minutes for someone to seat us. It was dead in there! A couple of servers noticed us but noone came to help us.\nFinally, after being seated, we had to wait another 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. We were more than ready to order at that point. I ordered a lunch combo, which consisted of a grilled shrimp salad and the California Turkey Club. My friend got the chicken brocolli pasta. We got our food reasonably fast. \nAnyway, my salad was pretty tasty but the sandwich was BLAND. The portions were tiny. My friend said she liked the pasta but it looked kinda dry to me. \nI would recommend going somewhere else for lunch."
134,My third time getting take-out from there and getting screwed on the guac I ordered. I called and spoke to the manager and was offered a free appetizer next time I came in. Nonsense... what incentive is that... to spend more money someplace that has already screwed me 3 times. The food s good... but there is better out there in this town that delivers and gets their orders correct every time. Thought I'd give them another chance and they BLEW it. How hard can it be to put a side of guac in a bag when you're not even busy? C'mon!?!

I was greatly disappointed with my experience at this Greek restaurant. Despite a promising first impression with a friendly staff and clean restaurant, the service quickly went downhill. My friends and I were completely ignored by our server, while others around us were being served promptly. We waited patiently for 20 minutes before finally giving up and leaving. It was beyond frustrating to see others receiving their drinks and food while we were left sitting empty-handed. As we left, we made sure to express our disappointment to the bartender, who seemed to have no care or concern for our experience. This kind of poor service is completely unacceptable. I refuse to support a restaurant that clearly has no regard for their customers. There are plenty of other options for Greek food in the area, and I will definitely be taking my business elsewhere in the future. Don't waste your time at this place if you expect timely and attentive service. "

While Gold Canyon Cafe may not have the flashy ambiance or trendy menu items of other restaurants, it's a reliable spot for a good meal at a reasonable price. Their homemade dishes never disappoint and the friendly service only adds to the overall experience. However, be prepared for the occasional annoyance of loud and demanding snowbirds who may disrupt your meal. Additionally, the only downside is the limited opening hours, which can be frustrating for those looking for a late night snack. But if you're tired of the chain restaurant scene and want a taste of homemade goodness, Gold Canyon Cafe is definitely worth a visit. Just remember, don't expect anything fancy here, but you'll still get a great meal at a great value. "

Shelly at this pizza place is amazing! My son and I always love coming here because she is so welcoming and friendly. Even when we just come in to get his free pizza for reading at school, she never rushes us and takes the time to chat with my son. She really knows how to make a positive impact on young readers and make them feel special. Plus, the pizza is delicious too! We always get the pepperoni and it never disappoints. Can't wait to come back and see Shelly's smiling face again."

I needed a quick lunch option while my car was in the shop, so I decided to try this place out for the first time. I went with the baby back ribs, which had an extra charge, and unfortunately, they were dry and flavorless. The sides were also lackluster - the Mac and cheese and green beans were nothing to write home about, and the jalape√±o cornbread was dry and tasted like sawdust. As someone who isn't too picky, I was disappointed and ended up throwing most of it away. However, the delivery was surprisingly fast, which is a plus. I will say, the one saving grace was the peach cobbler I added to meet the minimum delivery - it was delicious and definitely the highlight of my meal. But overall, I won't be returning for the food. Maybe I'll give their desserts a try, but I'll stick to other options for my main course."

""I don't even know where to begin with this hotel. First of all, I booked a room for my friend and I based on the seemingly great reviews and pictures online. But as soon as we arrived, we were sorely disappointed. The lobby may have looked nice, but once we got to our room, everything went downhill. The room was small and cramped, but that was the least of our worries. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting, with mold on the vanity and a door that fell off. The beds were basically just sheets thrown on top of one another, and they felt like they hadn't been washed in months. The whole place was just dusty and dirty, giving us terrible allergies. And to top it all off, we were charged way more than we had agreed upon at check-in. It wasn't until I complained to a supervisor that they even mentioned this ""amenities fee"" that was never discussed or approved. Oh, and did I mention the urine-covered bathroom seat? We overheard another guest complaining about the same thing, so at least we weren't alone in our misery. This place was a complete letdown and I would never recommend it to anyone. Save yourself the trouble and stay somewhere else."""

I had high hopes for this food truck, especially after hearing rave reviews from other people. But, I have to say, I was very disappointed. First of all, the wait time was ridiculous. I understand that good food takes time, but over 45 minutes for a sandwich and fries? Come on. And speaking of the fries, they were soggy and lacked any flavor. Definitely not worth the long wait.

But the worst part about this place was the customer service. The staff seemed more interested in chatting with each other than actually taking orders and serving customers. And when I finally did get my food, it was cold and the sandwich was falling apart. I'm sorry, but I don't want to eat a soggy, cold sandwich while standing on a crowded street corner.

I also have to mention the salad that everyone raves about. It was nothing special. In fact, I've had better salads from a fast food chain. The dressing was bland and the vegetables were not fresh.

Overall, I left very unsatisfied and will not be returning. I can't believe this place has been named people's favorite food truck. Maybe they should spend more time improving their food and service instead of chatting and taking pictures for social media. Save your money and go somewhere else. Trust me."

I'll start off by saying that this review is not based on the rating, but rather the experience as a whole. Don't get me wrong, the food was good. But that was about the only good thing about our visit to Silverton's Blingo Bingo. And let's be real, we didn't come here for the food. We came here for a fun night out with our families, and boy were we disappointed.

Let's start with the service. Our server was not polite at all. From the moment we walked in, we could tell he was not in the best mood. He took our orders wrong and brought out the wrong dish sizes. When we tried to inform him, he took away half of the dish and said they could adjust it. At this point, we couldn't help but wonder if he was going to serve it to someone else. Talk about a lack of courtesy.

To make matters worse, we had given our server a coupon at the time of ordering (which we received as hotel guests upon check-in). However, when we received our bill, the coupon hadn't been applied. When we asked our server about it, he told us to give him the coupon now. We explained that we had already given it to him while ordering, to which he responded with a sarcastic ""really?"". He then went away and brought back the corrected bill, but not without asking for our IDs to confirm we were staying at the hotel. Again, we understand the need for verification, but the way he went about it was incredibly rude. He even started talking to other customers while my husband was trying to show him our IDs. Talk about unprofessional.

At the end of it all, we still gave a tip because it's common courtesy on our part. But let's just say, the hospitality at this place was severely lacking. If you're just looking for good food, then sure, give this place a try. But if you're expecting any kind of decent customer service or overall hospitality, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Trust us, we learned our lesson."

We finally made it to this highly recommended restaurant and were excited to try it out. The decor was stunning and gave the place a classy atmosphere. However, we were a bit disappointed by the crowd - mostly older adults who seemed more interested in admiring the decorations than mingling and having a good time.

Our waiter, on the other hand, was the highlight of our evening. I couldn't help but develop a small crush on her, even though she seemed a bit distant and preoccupied. I still wonder about her and her story, especially since I found out she got divorced at a young age of 26. But alas, she was the only thing that kept our evening from being a total bust.

The food was decent - my husband enjoyed his burger and onion rings, while my grilled chicken sandwich was surprisingly delicious. It's not often that I find a place that satisfies both my husband's love for burgers and my picky taste buds. However, we probably won't be coming back here with our close group of friends. Unless, of course, it's just for a quick bathroom break or to say hello to our gem of a waitress.

Overall, the experience was mediocre. But I can see this place being a hit for business meetings or with people who don't know any better. So, we'll probably come back here with our boss or clients, but it won't be at the top of our list for a fun night out with friends."
143,"I would like to give the Compound Grill a half star, or maybe no stars at all, but I'll have to settle for one. Last night a large group of us went to see Karl Denson's Tiny Universe, posted on their website to begin at 8pm. We purchased tickets and arrived at half past seven to find that the show had been moved to 9pm. No big deal, we thought, we'll just share a few bottles of wine and pass the time.\n\nMeanwhile, a dozen television screens fill every wall with coverage of the McDowell Mountain Music Festival. Everywhere you look there's a screen of some jam band going on and on and the volume is way too high. Okay, no big deal we thought. Karl Denson is gonna show up and they'll turn this shit off and the night will begin.\n\n9pm passes and then 10pm passes. When we discussed the matter with a few of the hostesses/waitresses, they told us that they'd spoken with Karl Denson and he was on his way. On his way? This is at about 10:20pm. And if we wanted to hang around (with a bunch of $18 tickets), the show should start pretty soon, she said. When we asked to talk with a manager one of the women said there wasn't a manager available. What? How about the owner? can we please talk to someone? She informed us that the owner was probably home and asleep by now. Brilliant. Pushing 11pm we left. They were still doing sound check.\n\nThe incompetence of this place was pretty legendary last night. A \""sorry\"" would've been good enough for us. But, there was nothing but excuses and lack of responsibility taken. Maybe next time you can hold a contract with the visiting musicians. If they don't show, don't pay them. Regardless of what you do Compound Grill, we're gonna get our refund."

Nice place, but unfortunately not a fan. I had heard good things about this restaurant, so I was excited to try it out. However, my experience was less than impressive. The service from our waitress was passable, but the kitchen seemed to be having a rough day. It took a while for our food to come out, and when it did, everything was cold. It turns out they had messed up a steak (how does one even mess up a steak?!) which threw off the timing of all our meals.

I ordered the stromboli, which was just okay. It could have been better if it had been served hot. But when something like that happens, it's hard to overlook and become a fan of the restaurant. It's a shame, because from what I could tell, the stromboli would have been decent if it was warm.

On top of that disappointment, I also noticed that the wine on their menu seemed to be on the pricier side. Maybe that's just me, but I prefer restaurants that have more reasonable prices for their drinks.

Overall, my experience at this restaurant was just okay. The service was passable, the food was just okay, and the prices were a bit high. I might try giving it another chance on a different day, but for now, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to others."

We've been loyal customers of this hidden gem for years, from when it was tucked away in the K-Mart shopping center. Despite its unassuming location, their traditional but gourmet Thai food has always exceeded our expectations. Their Tom Kha Ghai and Tom Yum soups are a must-have, but the real star of the show is their Panang curry. It's hands down the best in town with its perfectly balanced flavors. 

One thing that sets this restaurant apart is their use of fresh ingredients in their dishes. It's evident in every bite and makes all the difference. And when it comes to spice, these guys are not messing around. I always order ""Thai"" hot, hoping for a sweat-inducing, nose-running experience, but usually end up disappointed at other restaurants. Not here though, they will warn you and deliver the heat!

While their food is consistently top-notch, the service can be a hit or miss. We've had the best experiences during late morning on weekdays, when it's less crowded and the staff seems more efficient. However, on a busy evening, the managers on the floor seem lost and the service can be slow. But when the food is this good, we're willing to overlook these hiccups.

Overall, this place is a must-try for all Thai food lovers. Don't be deterred by its location or sometimes under-staffed service. Take the time to savor each dish and you won't regret it. Trust us, we've been coming back for years."
147,"Ha! Luxury my butt. So I came here with my mom for a little pampering... I started out soaking, before my pedicure in lukewarm water. Ok lame but whatever, I'm not a complainer(usually) while my toes were being painted a lady was attempting to do my nails. I had to hold my arms out across my body for her to reach, it was so uncomfortable and not relaxing in the least. she did a crap job. Uneven lengths, not strait, messy polish. I was pissed. I said nicely \""could you please fix this\"" she acted like she didn't knew what I was talking about. I pointed out all the spots that were messed up and asked nicely. She then started arguing with me. Hell no! I held my ground and the manager came over, acknowledged the crap job and ushered me to a proper seat where he \""fixed\"" my manicure. His attempt was admirable, I was just ready to go at this point. As I was finished i hear my mom \""you've got to be kidding me\"" I walk over to find nail polish all smeared up her arm. She was getting a gel mani and the guy forgot to dry her last coat before the hand massage. Ha! What can you do but laugh. This place is a joke. Save your time and money."

We stumbled upon this quaint restaurant on our first night in Paris and decided to give it a try. The menu had a variety of options, but unfortunately we didn't realize that all entrees came with separate sides until it was too late. But we were already cozy in our seats and decided to stay. I'm not a fan of steak, so I opted for the chicken dish and a side of wild mushroom risotto. Let me tell you, that risotto was absolutely delicious. So flavorful and creamy, I could have eaten it as my main course. We also ordered some spinach, which was a bit bland, but the french fries were definitely a hit. We also tried the zucchini sticks, which were a nice addition to our meal. Our friends ordered the steak and wine and raved about how good it was. I trust their judgement, even though the steak didn't look very appealing to me.

Our server was very friendly and made sure our friends wouldn't be late for their show. The staff in general was welcoming and accommodating. They even moved to the side when they saw us coming, unlike some other rude servers who just try to push past you. The overall experience was okay, but unfortunately my chicken dish fell short. Perhaps I'll try one of those delicious-looking steaks next time instead."

Tonight was a huge disappointment. After seeing this place featured on the Travel Channel, my wife and I were excited to try it out. But after our experience, I can confidently say we will not be returning. Let's start with the positives - the onion rings and garlic fries were alright. But let's be real, there is no way those onion rings were actually beer-battered. They were more like generic frozen rings that have been sitting in the freezer for way too long. And while the fries were decent, they didn't make up for the main course disaster. My chipotle burger had me feeling sick just 20 minutes after taking a few bites. And let's not forget, this is supposed to be a travel-worthy restaurant. But instead, it's nothing more than a dirty shack with freezer-burned burger patties. And to top it all off, after expressing my concerns to the staff, they simply shrugged it off and offered no solution. It's clear that quality control is not a priority here. The biggest disappointment, however, was the realization that our meal was nothing but spoiled food disguised as fresh. Needless to say, we will not be returning. I may have left with a sour taste in my mouth, but I certainly won't be coming back to this place anytime soon."
150,"Prepare to spend money. What was delivered for $41 were 2 burgers, fries, onion rings and one coke.  Fries were very good, onion rings were good and the burgers lacked real flavor.

I had a layover at this airport and decided to grab a quick snack before my connecting flight. I had heard great things about the coffee shop in the old historic home, so I couldn't resist stopping by. However, I was disappointed to find out that they only served tea and not coffee. Not a big deal, but I was hoping for a nice latte or cappuccino to perk me up for my next flight.

The tea I ordered was average, nothing special. It tasted like something I could have brewed at home. I was disappointed that they didn't have any unique blends or flavors. It would have been nice if they had partnered with a local tea shop to offer more variety. But on a positive note, the server was friendly and attentive.

I was also pleasantly surprised by the quaint and charming atmosphere of the coffee shop located in an old historic house. It was a nice change of pace from the airport chaos outside. I wish I had more time to explore and take in the historic details of the house.

Although my overall experience was just okay, I can see how this coffee shop would be a lovely hidden gem for those with a longer layover or just looking for a break from the hustle and bustle of the airport. Just make sure to plan accordingly and allow enough time for the long lines and crowds on busy travel days."
153,"RIBS RIBS RIBS!!! Apparently this is the place to go for ribs. I'll have to give it to them, it was juicy and falling off the bone. But it wasn't flavorful or saucy enough. We had to ask the waiter to bring more sauce, but by the time he got it for us we were almost half way done.\n\nI got the porterhouse Pittsburgh style, which was quite delicious. The sides are huge. I opted out of the butter and garlic, so got the bowl of sauteed mushrooms on the side to top my steak. I had enough to share with my table of 11. Very reasonably priced and it was super crowded on a Sunday night. Our waiter was pretty good, he was pretty busy himself attending to all of us.\n\nI would come back for a nice, meaty meal with a group of friends."

I'll start by saying that Star Trek has never been my thing. I don't understand all the hype around it and I've never been able to sit through a full episode. So when I first heard about this Star Trek themed restaurant, I was a bit skeptical. But let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised! The attention to detail in the spaceship design and the costumes of the actors was impressive. I even had a hilarious encounter with the Quark character who sat at my table and stayed in character the entire time. I couldn't stop laughing.

However, I have to say that the lighting in this place is a bit too dim for my liking. And when I say dim, I mean I nearly got scared out of my seat when a Klingon lady, in full costume, peeked at me from the side of my booth. She was intense! But it all added to the immersive experience of being in a Star Trek world.

I have to give a shoutout to the drinks at this place. They were out of this world! Literally, some of them were so strong that I felt like I was on a different planet after just one sip. And let me tell you, I am not complaining. We even came back another time for dinner and everyone in my group enjoyed their meals. Though I have to admit, the Star Trek theme was definitely the highlight for me.

Overall, despite not being a fan of the franchise, I had a surprisingly great time at this restaurant. Though, I have to say, the dim lighting and uber strong drinks may have had something to do with it. Live long and prosper, I guess?"

The bread during our last visit was a complete disappointment! The crust was too hard and the inside was dry and bland. We had high expectations from Lee's famous hot baguettes, but unfortunately, they did not live up to the hype. It's a shame because the toppings and fillings were actually quite tasty. We also ordered the shrimp and pork egg rolls while waiting for our number to be called, and they were not bad for a snack, but definitely overpriced at $3.99. The overall experience was just okay, but we were really hoping for that classic, perfect Lee's baguette. Maybe we'll give it another try during the HOT BAGUETTES NOW promotion."
156,Tao is a beautiful restaurant and the food is very good.  Especially the Chilean sea bass it was to die for.\n\nHowever the service was very bad.  Our server was non-existence.  Only came a couple of times and it took 10 minutes to take our order.\n\nHe seem pre-occupied and even when he took our order he was looking elsewhere. \n\nWe spent $200 for two people but I had way better service at Denny's.\n\nI wish I had brought it up to the manager at the time but we were in a rush to get to a club.  I guess it's a hit and miss reading some of these reviews.  All else equal this would of been a 5 star but service was so bad it warrants only 2.
157,"First time the BF and I dropped in I grabbed bun with pork, shrimp and eggroll. Their bun is really good. The eggroll was nice, the pork and shrimp had a nice marinade and was cooked to juicy. The noodles were blanched just right and the veggies below were very fresh. The BF had the curry and while it was full of mixed veggies and chicken, he didn't really like it. I tried a bit later at home and it tasted more like gravy than curry and I thought it was okay, but not something I would order again. \n\nWe weren't feeling so great this week and came for their vegetable and tofu pho. I don't think they have vegetarian broth here or if they do it's not on the menu. There was a lot of broccoli, carrots, bokchoy and tofu in it so they didn't skimp on that which is nice and the sprouts and basil and the \""saw leaf\"" that came to the table was very fresh. The broth was a bit too heavy with white pepper and star anise though. It did the trick with helping my sore throat, but it was abit overpowering of a flavor that I don't prefer. I hope that this isn't the usual and was just an off day...I would give it a chance again. \n\n I generally think the quality of ingredients here is better than the standard and because of the location far from any competition, the prices reflect both things so keep that in mind. People get so used to dirt cheap pho that you may feel it's expensive even though most items are below 10 bucks. I think the service is decent, and friendly both times and seem family run. \n\nI say, come for the bun / rice plate , but some of the other things I'm not too sure about. I'm sure we will be back. Sometimes we just don't want to drive all the way from Centennial to Chinatown to get some Viet food."

My sister and I just had dinner here and we were both disappointed. First of all, the parking lot was a bit sketchy with homeless people lurking around. It was a bit unsettling and made us feel uncomfortable. We rushed inside to get away from them and the hostess didn't seem to do anything about it. Not a great way to start off our dinner experience. Our reservation was for 7:30 but we ended up waiting until 7:20 to be seated. While we waited at the bar, we ordered some drinks and I have to say, the happy hour prices were pretty decent. The bartender was very friendly and the mango mojito I ordered was pretty good, although a bit too sweet for my taste. Once we were seated, we ordered two rolls - an Aiea roll and a Sunrise Hakama roll. The Aiea roll was just average, nothing really stood out to me. But the Sunrise Hakama roll was so bland that we ended up asking to have it boxed up. Our server, Jerry, was very apologetic and offered to take it back but we didn't think it was necessary. We also ordered the poached lobster and filet and the sea bass. Unfortunately, all of our entrees were not good. The lobster was dry and had a slightly burnt taste, the filet was also not great, and the sea bass was cooked in batter with zero flavor. The quinoa that came with it also tasted burnt. The only saving grace was the coconut creme brulee dessert, which was absolutely delicious. Jerry was a great server though, very attentive and sweet. Overall, we were both disappointed in the food here. The reviews on Yelp were pretty good, but I honestly don't see why. I don't think I would return for the food, but maybe for the service and dessert. My first experience here was just mediocre."
159,"Every now and then it's advisable to check this second hand book store as a cheaper substitute to its looming neighbour (Blackwells). Even if I've popped in for a fleeting glance the owner always asks what I'm looking for, suggests an alternative if the book is not available and eagerly helps me find exactly what I'm looking for. Admittedly some of the mark up prices will have you questioning if the shop is worthy of the second hand label (some are a little expensive) but nonetheless you may one day take heed of this advice and find a bargain."
160,"It was just kind of...meh. Based on the service. Took out of town family in Christmas Eve to check out the very interesting menu. Our waitress had no personality at all. We could almost hear her eye rolls as she left our table each time. We really felt like we were a bother to her. \n\nWe started at happy hour snacks and led into dinner. Pork belly was great! Fried artichoke was delicious and I am craving some now. Harvest salad was great. Love the pecans and blue cheese.  Others at the table ordered grilled BBQ ginger pork chop, chopped ranch salad, and the happy hour burger (great deal at $6!). \n\nOne day we'll try it again. The menu is so diverse and exciting. Wish our waitress had been on board."

I was really looking forward to trying out this coffee shop that I had heard so many good things about in Old La Prairie. My friends and I decided to stop by after our walk through the historic area. However, our experience was far from pleasant.

The coffee was mediocre at best and the sandwiches were dry and tasteless. To make matters worse, the service was incredibly slow and the staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than taking care of their customers.

But the cherry on top of this disappointing visit was when my friend accidentally bumped into one of the employees and was immediately grabbed and aggressively pulled into a back room. I was shocked and horrified to witness the same employee physically assaulting other customers in the same room. It was like a scene out of a horror movie.

After trying to reason with the employee and being falsely accused of pushing and disrespecting them, we were finally allowed to leave and get our things. But the damage was done. Not only were we shaken up by the encounter, but we also noticed bruises on our bodies the next day.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, especially families with children. It's a shame because the location is so charming and could have been a perfect spot for a day out. But the rude and violent behavior of the staff ruins it all. Stay far away from this nightmare of a coffee shop."

This restaurant definitely caters to the elite and wealthy crowd, so if you're a rich bunny rabbit, this is the place for you. However, as someone who values comfort and affordability, I was not too impressed with my experience. The atmosphere was definitely upscale and the prices reflected that, but unfortunately, that was about the only thing that stood out. The creamy tomato soup, which I was really looking forward to, was served cold, and the crackers were like tough pieces of tree bark. The sandwich I ordered was nothing special, just a basic salad with some uninspired flavors. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the emphasis on healthy ingredients, but when I can make something similar at home for a fraction of the cost, why should I spend $50.00 here? Overall, I was disappointed with the lackluster food and hefty bill, and I'll probably save my money and creativity for my own homemade salads."

I have been a regular at this restaurant for the past five years, but unfortunately, I will no longer be returning. I used to enjoy their lunch specials, but after my recent visit, I can confidently say that the quality has drastically declined. The menu has changed completely, and not for the better. I couldn't believe I was paying $13 for a bun filled mostly with cabbage. This is definitely not worth the price.

It's clear that this place has been corrupted by all the positive reviews it received years ago. It's a shame that they think they can get away with serving subpar food and charging exorbitant prices. I would suggest going elsewhere if you want to get your money's worth. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the food did seem fresh. But when it comes down to it, freshness doesn't make up for the lack of taste and value. Adios, this place will now be a part of my past and not my future."

The atmosphere at Pot Tea Social House is charming and cozy, making it the perfect spot to unwind and indulge in some delicious treats. My husband and I were looking forward to trying their famous shaved ice, but unfortunately, the experience fell short. Despite calling ahead and being assured of the price for international shipping, we were met with a frustrating situation upon arrival.

The employee, Andrew, seemed confused and unable to process our shipment, claiming that our package could not be sent to the country we needed it to go to. This was incredibly disappointing, especially since we were only shipping paper. To make matters worse, Andrew refused to get on the phone with anyone or call his manager to resolve the issue. Instead, he simply told us to go to UPS. It's safe to say that we left Pot Tea feeling incredibly frustrated and disappointed.

Thankfully, we found a solution at the FedEx on Power Rd in Mesa. Not only were they able to ship our package without any issues, but their staff was also competent and provided excellent customer service. The complete lack of assistance and professionalism at Pot Tea was a huge disappointment. In the end, we wasted precious time and energy dealing with their incompetence. Save yourself the trouble and head to a more reliable shipping company."

I had such high hopes for this restaurant when I first walked in. The ambiance was great and the staff was friendly and helpful. But unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype. I ordered the special bao with chicken, beef, and duck and was disappointed to find that the meat was dry and lacking in flavor. I was also unimpressed with the chicken rice bowl, which was supposed to be a twist on Hainanese Chicken Rice. But to me, it just tasted like plain, boring chicken and rice. The only redeeming dish was the seasonal butternut squash soup, but even then, it felt more like a dessert than a savory starter. The sesame noodles were also a let-down, lacking the punch of flavor that I was hoping for. Overall, I left the restaurant feeling underwhelmed and still hungry. My only advice to future diners would be to stick to the basics and order their wings - at least those seem to be consistent."
166,This place is a terrible idea unless your rich and can order like 5 burritos they are acrimony as shit my burrito was 6$ and the size of like a taquito. My order was 20$ for that and 3 mini ass tacos with no flavor. If your really looking for Mexican food this ain't it. The horchata is good. Anyone recommend a real Mexican place in central Phoenix?

My friends and I stopped by this restaurant for breakfast during our trip to Las Vegas for a convention. We had heard great things about it, but unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed. First off, there were no signs indicating where to line up when approaching from the casino level. By the time we saw the line and got in it, we had been waiting for a while and they ended up feeling sorry for us and letting us through. 
Our server, or lack thereof, was pretty awful. I can't believe the Aria doesn't have better customer service talent in Vegas. She slammed my drink on the table and was overall just not very friendly. 
Now onto the food. The pancakes were hard and not very good, and to our surprise, they didn't even offer maple syrup. We were only given berry toppings - what is this, a brand new hotel or the Nugget? 
Overall, I think this place is a bit overrated. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that offer better food and service for a similar price. "
168," However, I also had an ultrasound appointment scheduled for the same day as my appointment

As a frequent visitor to this establishment, I was excited to finally stay at this highly praised medical facility. However, our experience was far from enjoyable. While the triage and front office staff were top-notch, the communication throughout the rest of our visit was severely lacking. Despite being told a doctor would be in to check on me shortly, I found myself waiting in the exam room for a whopping 45 minutes with no update. And to make matters worse, I was left half-naked in the room the entire time.

Thankfully, the physician assistant who eventually saw me was attentive and understanding. She listened to my concerns and scheduled a PT referral for me, which I greatly appreciated. However, my ultrasound appointment was scheduled for the same day as my appointment and it was nowhere to be found on my schedule. The lack of communication and organization in this aspect was disappointing.

Overall, while I had high hopes for this facility, the experience fell short. The communication and follow-through from the medical staff was lacking, leaving me feeling frustrated and forgotten. It's a shame because the initial care and interactions with the staff were promising. Hoping to see some improvements in the future."
169,"I took my 21 month old son here for the first time today.  It's in a house that's been converted into a play space.  We were disappointed overall.  We arrived at 10 AM (their opening time) and the place was locked.  The man running the place showed up at 10:15.  Off to a bad start.  The place is cramped and taking more than one child would be very difficult since the play areas are in different rooms.  You have to basically climb over other parents and kids to get from one room to the other.  It didn't seem very clean though the toys were high quality.  Also, since it's a house, the acoustics are horrible when there are 20 loud children playing.  It can get quite claustrophobic.  It's a shame because it's a good idea in theory but has been executed poorly here."

I recently dined at this restaurant with my family and overall, it was a decent experience. However, I'm giving this place 3.5 stars for a few reasons. Let's start with the food - it was okay. Not terrible, but definitely nothing to write home about. My husband ordered a turkey burger and didn't find it very enjoyable. Plus, most of our dishes were served at room temperature or even cold. We did notice that the restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived, so maybe that's why our food wasn't piping hot. 
On the bright side, our server was fantastic. She was very personable and warm, making our dining experience more enjoyable. She was also very attentive without being too overbearing. 
Overall, I think this place has potential. It may have been a bit of an off day for the kitchen, and our server definitely made up for it. We will definitely give it another chance and hopefully, the food will be much better. Plus, the price was very reasonable for the amount of food we received. It's definitely a dive, but for under $60 for four people, we can't complain too much."
171,"This place is a joke. Whatever you do--don't pay extra for feta cheese cuz you won't get it lol! 2nd time this has happened. 1st time, okay I understand but 2nd time - now your just making free $$ .\n\nAsked for my gyro with feta cheese, tomatoes & lettuce. Lettuce went missing too! My asst. Ordered a chicken pita & there was 4 very small pieces dried up pieces of chicken.\n\nI called to today to let them know they needed to pick up the pace & not rip people off with feta cheese, & lack of lettuce and lack of chicken of my assts lunch. But the owner answered and told me to speak with the person who made the lunches!! Are you kidding me ? What owner puts their cook on the phone ? A lazy one!! Yes, the cook messed up but to put the cook on the phone to handle the situation ?! The cook even said it was unprofessional of the owner to put him on the phone. \n\nSo, you will not get feta, lettuce, decent chicken or a answer from management/owner.. But the cook is forced to talk with angry customers! Lol! What a joke!"
172,"We dined at this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation.  From the moment we sat down things were a bit off.  Our table for two had one of us against the wall and the other in a chair.  Clearly standard, but the extra long table was not.  We were so far away from each other that we could barely converse.  The couple next to us had actually turned their table and were sitting next to each other against the wall to combat this issue.  \n\nOur service was AWFUL.  The waiter barely checked in on us and when we asked him questions about the menu he provided little additional detail and was actually fairly aloof.\n\nThe food was actually worse than the table and the waiter.  I had the short rib and it was completely charred.  So overdone that I couldn't get down more than 5 bites.  When I informed the waiter how poor it was he said that they could offer us a free dessert.  Somehow at the end of a terrible meal the last thing I want is more food from you!\n\nMy husband had the lobster pot pie, which was decent but not nearly as good as you would expect for a signature dish at a restaurant of this price point.  We also tried the horseradish whipped potatoes, which I did not enjoy but that may just be due to heavy horseradish more than a universal issue.  We also had the lobster rolls and cheese fondue, which were both good.  We saw many other diners eating the Kobe burger and fries entree.  We would clearly never go back here, but I would recommend other diners stick to the less expensive and more basic options, as they seem to be more successful."

Instead of going to our usual spots for Mexican food like Blanco, LA Fonda Del Sol and Z'tejas, we decided to try somewhere new. I hoped that this little joint would be awesome but within 10 minutes of arriving, I lost hope. We sat, got our menus, ordered our drinks and received our drinks. 10...15 minutes later, no one had come to our table to take our order. I got up to ask who our server was. We got an apology and our new server was really nice but it did not make up for how bad the food was. I ordered the Chile relleno and it was pretty much a soggy bell pepper with cheese that was drenched with the same salsa they served with the chips. It just looked like a sad dinner. Not worth the money... Boyfriend ordered the enchiladas - no bueno. But the drinks were good! They took care of the first round of drinks to make up for forgetting us but nothing makes me want to go back. But we tried!"

Let me start off by saying, I had high hopes for this area. I heard great things about Market Square and was excited to check it out. But unfortunately, my experience was not as great as I had hoped.

First off, the area is absolutely gorgeous. The buildings are beautiful and the layout is quite charming. I can see why this would seem like the perfect spot for a night out. However, the reality is, Market Square really only livens up on the weekends. During the week, it's quite empty and uneventful. And for someone like me who works during the weekends, this was a huge disappointment.

But, even though it may not be as lively during the week, I was willing to give it a chance. I decided to grab a bite to eat at one of the numerous restaurants in the area. And let me tell you, the food itself was actually quite good. However, the prices were a bit steep for what they were offering. I was expecting a bit more for the amount I paid.

But the biggest issue I had with this place was the lack of public transportation. Being from a big city, I am used to having a reliable and efficient public transit system. However, in Pittsburgh, this is sadly not the case. And I couldn't help but think about how much better this area could be if there was a better way to get around.

Overall, Market Square has a lot of potential. The beautiful buildings, the variety of restaurants, and the charming atmosphere all make it seem like the perfect spot for a night out. But it is severely hindered by the lack of public transportation and the limited liveliness during the week. I really hope the city can take measures to improve this area and make it the entertainment destination it has the potential to be. "

I was hoping for a delicious slice of pizza, but unfortunately, this place did not deliver. The convenience of having pizza by the slice was overshadowed by the subpar quality of the food. The pepperoni pizza was just decent, and the chicken bacon ranch was a major disappointment. I should have stuck to the classic flavors instead of experimenting. On top of that, the price was a bit steep for what we got. I understand that we're in a prime location, but that doesn't excuse the lackluster experience. Next time, I'll stick to walking down the street and grabbing a slice elsewhere. Save yourself some money and avoid this place at all costs. "

We had high hopes for this restaurant, as they boasted the largest selection of draft beers in the area. But our experience here was far from impressive. First off, the layout was nice and we were excited to sit outside and enjoy our drinks. But that's where the positives end. Our server was pleasant and helpful, but that's the only positive interaction we had with the staff. The beer selection was great, with a couple of new favorites discovered. But then came the downside. We were disappointed to find that the manager had to check my ID because I was from out of state. As if that wasn't enough, they charged a dollar for beer samples. Who does that? As for the food, the inside of the restaurant was a little too dark for our liking, so we opted to sit outside. But even then, the lackluster food couldn't save our dining experience. We couldn't help but feel ignored and the arrogant and nasty owners who also served as the wait staff didn't help either. To add insult to injury, we were charged an exorbitant amount for an ordinary meal. What a disappointment. Needless to say, we won't be returning to this establishment anytime soon. Don't waste your time or money here."
177,Terrible!! \nWhen we are greeted @ the door the hostess tells us there is a $15.00 minimum per person per hour...trust me that's not a problem but such a turn off to be there greeting.

This place is highly overrated. Sure, they may have good burgers, but their layout is just awkward. You have to walk up and down stairs just to get to the bar or the dance floor. And good luck getting a drink at the crowded bar. My friends and I came here because we heard that Enriq Iglesias was going to be there, but it was a huge disappointment. The drinks were only free until 11pm, and then the bartender tried to charge us $20 for two screwdrivers. Talk about false advertising. We ended up paying and leaving, never to return again. Don't waste your time at this place."

After trying out this place for both dining in and catering, I have to say that the food here is consistently average. We've had dinners catered at our home and the food was fresh and well-packed, earning them a solid 5 stars in terms of quality. However, the delivery is not always reliable and it would be great if they could handle larger orders. Despite this, we keep coming back to India Garden even though it's a bit far from our usual area. Trust me, the taste and quality are worth the extra bucks. There are other Indian restaurants nearby, but none can match up to the flavor at India Garden."

My friends and I decided to try out Bayside for dinner after hearing about their $33 per person price tag. We were excited to indulge in some delicious food, but unfortunately, our experience was just okay. The buffet had a small selection and could definitely be expanded upon. Compared to the amazing buffet at Bellagio, Bayside fell short. The dishes were decent, but there was room for improvement in terms of taste and quality. I was disappointed that for such a high price, we didn't get much variety in the salad bar, entrees, or desserts. Needless to say, I won't be coming back to Bayside anytime soon. It's just not worth it for the price."

I had high hopes for Pink's as I had heard great things about this iconic LA hot dog spot. However, I was incredibly underwhelmed by my recent visit. The hot dogs were lackluster and the buns were just plain stale. I was expecting a mouthwatering experience, but instead, all I tasted was disappointment.

The onion rings were no better. They were bland and flavorless, reminding me of the frozen ones I could get at any generic fast food joint. I was hoping to find a hidden gem in Pink's, but unfortunately, it was just like any other mediocre hot dog stand.

I have fond memories of Pink's from my childhood in LA, but after this experience, I'm not sure what the hype is all about. The chili on the dogs had an out-of-place hint of cinnamon that just didn't work for me. And to top it off, the service was subpar and the owner seemed unfriendly.

I miss the days of enjoying a delicious hot dog and onion rings at Pink's, but unfortunately, this visit was a major letdown. Save your money and go elsewhere for a better and more enjoyable hot dog experience. "

My friends and I decided to give Bouchon a try during our trip to Las Vegas and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant and took the private elevator from the casino level, we knew we were in for a treat.

The first night, we tried their famous steak frites and were blown away by the tenderness of the meat. Each plate also came with an abundance of French fries, which our server proudly informed us was 17 potatoes worth. And let me tell you, they were worth every calorie.

The next morning, we couldn't resist coming back for their highly recommended brunch. And let me say, it was a brunch to remember. We started off with the cheese tasting, which included honey, cheese, and apples. The flavors combined perfectly and left us wanting more. The Madame Croque sandwich was a fun and unique twist on the classic ham and cheese, with the added bonus of eggs. And of course, we had to try their famous chicken and waffles. The chicken was baked instead of fried, but it was still incredibly juicy and flavorful. And the waffles were full of herbs and spices that made them stand out from any others we've tried before.

Unfortunately, the one disappointment of our experience was the drinks. We had a couple of draft beers, which were over $4 each and served in small glasses. We were hoping for a full pint, but unfortunately, that was not the case. Considering the decadence and deliciousness of our food, we were a bit disappointed by the lackluster drinks.

Overall, Bouchon definitely deserves 5 stars for their amazing dining experience. If only the drinks could have lived up to the same standard, it would have been a perfect meal. Despite this, I would highly recommend giving them a try during your next trip to Vegas."

My friends and I were drawn to Sprinkles Cupcakes because of its charming atmosphere and impressive display of cupcakes. We couldn't resist trying some of their famous flavors, so we each got a selection to share. I have to say, the cupcakes were good, but not amazing. The vanilla with chocolate buttercream was just okay, and the coconut was a bit dry. The standout was the carrot cupcake, which had a delicious balance of flavors. Unfortunately, the prices left a bad taste in my mouth. $3.50 for a cupcake? That's a bit steep, especially considering they didn't have any unique ingredients or fancy decorations. I know what it takes to make a good cupcake, and I can confidently say that I would not charge more than $2 for one. While the cupcakes at Sprinkles were enjoyable, they were not worth the price. Next time, I'll stick to baking my own and save some money."

Unfortunately, my experience at this salon was not as great as I had hoped. I was in town for a wedding and my wife was constantly reminding me to get a haircut. Her friend recommended Belle Cheveux Salon and specifically mentioned Amber Carmen as a skilled stylist. I was able to book an appointment with Amber on short notice, which was a plus. However, the haircut itself was just average. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't anything special. I was hoping for a bit more of a wow factor.

I will say, Amber was friendly and professional throughout the appointment. She listened to what I wanted and delivered exactly that. But for the price and hype, I was expecting something more. And while the salon itself was clean and well-kept, it felt a bit generic and lacking in character.

Overall, if you're in a pinch and need a quick, decent haircut, I would recommend Amber at Belle Cheveux Salon. However, if you're looking for a unique and exceptional experience, I would suggest looking elsewhere. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I left feeling underwhelmed. "

Came back at 430 and the check in line was looong! We waited and since nothing was signed we had to wait to actually get a room assigened to us.  When we got to our room I was happy. The rooms are updated and spacious and wouldn't mind staying there for a night or 2 again.  My only complaint are the elevator wait times...they took forever and after a long day of walking around you don't want to wait in a crowded lobby just for an elevator to get there.  I liked the food court and other food options as they had Mcdonalds, Subway, and Zabbas.  They also had a sushi Restaraunt and Hash House (which seemed to have a long wait Sun morning, but that's expected) my only other tip is check to make sure you don't need anything from the gift shop that you may have forgot to pack because it does close...I believe I went around 1230a and they were closed.

Unfortunately, the wait for our food was extremely long - an entire hour with only one refill in between. To make matters worse, when my dish finally arrived, it was chicken instead of the promised eggplant. After another 10 minutes, my correct meal came out, but I have to say, it was just okay. The house salad that came with it was lackluster, with mostly just plain lettuce. Overall, we were disappointed with our experience at Pacino's.

My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.\n\nI came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.\n\nI would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!"

Not impressed. My wife and I decided to give this place a try for breakfast since it looked cute from the outside. Big mistake. The atmosphere was nice and the service was friendly, but the food was a letdown. We both ordered the breakfast combos, one with French toast and one with pancakes, both with eggs, bacon, and toast. The presentation was decent, but the taste was underwhelming. It reminded us of a frozen breakfast from a box, not something we expected from a sit-down restaurant. And to add insult to injury, the bill came out to be around $30. That's a lot of money for a subpar breakfast. We were so disappointed. Needless to say, we won't be back."
197,"Gord and I drove to St. Jacobs a couple weeks ago.\n\nIt was lunchtime so we went to Benjamin's Restaurant & Inn.\n\nNestled in the heart of the Village of St. Jacobs, Benjamin's Restaurant & Inn offers its guests the charm of a vintage inn with modern conveniences for your comfort. For 150 years, the building which houses Benjamin's has accommodated overnight guests.

The burger was good ... the fries so-so so I just had a few.\n\nGord ordered the wild boar meatloaf.

He said the meatloaf was good.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint and old fashioned ... there was mostly an older clientele when we were there."
198,"If I could give negative stars, I would.  \n\nTHEhotel at Mandalay Bay was supposed to be the site of my wedding on 11/11/11.  2 months before the day, the O Suite (2000sqft penthouse) was booked and paid for in full.  A week before the day, I called to confirm.  The day before, I called to confirm.\n  \nThe day of, 8 hours before the wedding, they had given the suite (as well as all other penthouse suites) to Manny Pacquiao and his entourage.

I cried.  ALL day.  This was a destination wedding, we had people coming from across the country and other countries in general.  Now we had a skimpy 800sqft suite (which they kicked someone else out of, I'm sure) to hold a 35 person wedding ceremony & reception in?  Luckily, our great friends searched the city for what turned out to be an even better penthouse suite at the Trump Tower 4 hours before the wedding was to start (go there!).\n\nTHEhotel only offered that other suite and another basic room to us, that's it.  There was NEVER an apology, just simply a, \""we understand your frustration.\""  What they did was illegal, breach of contract.  There is a totally a small claims case there.  Finally, after PULLING TEETH we received our money back as well as a $400 comp to use at the hotel/Mandalay Bay (which we used to take all remaining guests in town out to lunch & I got a much needed 80min massage at their spa). \n\nWhile it all ended up working out and for the better (go to Trump Tower!), needless to say, I will NEVER stay here or give THEhotel/Mandalay Bay my business EVER again."
199,"Oh CB&C I hate to do this to you, but I'm afraid you earned it. And it's not about the food. I am a regular visitor to this place probably coming 2 to 3 times a month to have the buffalo chicken dip, which I highly enjoy with a side of ranch. Last night we popped in at 9pm after a movie. Closing time was 10. Sat at the bar to grab a bite, but we couldn't even get the bartender's attention for a menu. I mean all the way down to shouting \""excuse me, excuse me\"". Here's the catch, the bar was not busy, there were perhaps 5 patrons there. The guy tending bar was far more concerned with closing out for the night and talking football with some other customers to even look our way. A waitress did finally get his attention for us, and we ordered beer and asked for menus. You know what? After several minutes still no beer and the bartender was back to closing out his register. At that point we decided to leave. There is no need to beg for service and too many places to grab a meal to be ignored. CB&C, I hope you read your yelp reviews and fix this soon. I like your location, I like your food, but if I can't even order it, you've got a problem."

During our visit to Mesa Grill, my partner and I were hoping for an exceptional dining experience from acclaimed chef Bobby Flay. Unfortunately, our visit left us feeling underwhelmed and disappointed. First off, the steak that we ordered for a whopping $50 was lacking in flavor and failed to meet our expectations. It was perfectly cooked, but the taste just didn't live up to the price. Thankfully, the tuna nachos were a saving grace and definitely the highlight of our meal. These were truly delicious and I can see why they have received so much praise on Yelp. We also tried the goat cheese queso fundido, which was decent but nothing to write home about. Our experience wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the subpar service we received. Our waitress seemed more interested in complaining to her coworker about wanting to leave early than attending to our needs. We had to flag down another server just to get some attention. Overall, while the appetizers and wine were enjoyable, the lackluster steak and service did not justify the high prices. Unfortunately, this will probably be our first and last visit to Mesa Grill. I expected more from Bobby Flay. "

Weather was nice (not windy, not cold).\n\nThe bad (this list is long):\n1. Running bag with little to no goodies/coupons.\n2. More expensive registration fee than a lot of other cities.\n3. Difficult to find parking near the start line, thus needing to walk 1-2 miles to just get to the start.\n4. Rubbing elbows with people for the first mile of the run due to the amount of people per corral.\n5. Poorly lit or unlit roads near Fremont street...first off it's ghetto there and second  off now I'm going to trip and potentially get injured =(\n6. Post-race snacks after the finish line were lame!  They didn't have bottles of water right after the finish line...you had to walk quite a ways before finding a bottle.  And in terms of the snacks, I mean at least throw in some bananas.  At the Seattle one there was a plethora of snacks and even jamba juice.  They had beer....but honestly I'd prefer a banana over a beer after a long run.\n7.  The medals were not consistent.  I ended up with a nice one, but my brothers ended up with some jacked up looking medals with faded print and colors.  However, they did say they would replace the medal after my brother took a picture of his and sent in an email.\n\nI know the amount of people at the Vegas run is 30k plus, a lot more than other cities.

Only positive for me is that I shaved off 10 minutes from my last PR =)"
203,"Slow, painfully slow service.  Only one register open regardless of the length of line.  They exist only because they have a perfect location.  Unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in.  Wait times for food are horrendous.

204,Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.

Due to my budget restrictions (insuring a family of four, with 2 adults over 50) I basically had two choices, and each was with Health Net.

They don't send me bills by US mail or email, although I've selected both methods. Their Accounting department doesn't acknowledge payments I've made 40 days ago. I do have membership cards, but how can you trust a company that doesn't even have the ability to be competent at the basic stuff like billing and accounting. How could healthcare.gov use a supplier that isn't prepared to take on a large number of clients?

However, the first time my friend and I came late at night, there was no problem; the second, we were told that unless we were of age to drink, we couldn't come in. It didn't make sense. We were not trying to drink or sit at the bar, and it's not like RA becomes some sort of nightclub after 10. Still, the waiter refused to seat us.\nSo that was kind of, well, off-putting.

I have been meaning to write this review for a while now, but I finally got around to it. And let me tell you, my experience at the Las Vegas Rock n Roll Half Marathon was not a pleasant one. Despite being my second time participating in this event, I have to say that Seattle's version is way better. And no, this is not just hometown bias talking.

Let's start with the positives, shall we? The health and fitness expo prior to the race was easily accessible and there was no parking fee. Running at night with all of the lights from the main Strip was also a cool experience. And the weather was actually nice, not too cold or windy.

But the bad? Where do I even begin. First off, the registration fee for this race was more expensive than other cities. And the fact that I had to walk 1-2 miles just to get to the start line because of the lack of parking was ridiculous. And let's talk about the poorly lit or unlit roads near Fremont street. Not only was it sketchy, but also a potential safety hazard. Can't they light up the course better for the runners?

And the post-race snacks? What a joke. Not only were there barely any goodies or coupons in the running bag, but the snacks after the finish line were also lacking. No bananas, no jamba juice like they had in Seattle. And don't even get me started on the medals. My brother ended up with a jacked up looking one, with faded print and colors. At least they were willing to replace it after he sent in a picture and complained.

Sure, I understand that there were over 30,000 participants in this race, but that doesn't excuse the lack of organization and attention to detail. And the novelty of running on the Strip quickly wore off, leaving me with an uneventful, uninspired run. The only saving grace was that I beat my previous PR by 10 minutes. But overall, I was highly disappointed with the whole experience. Definitely not worth the high registration fee. "

I had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. Upon entering, I noticed that the menu in my room and in front of the restaurant both advertised meatloaf, which I was eager to try. However, the waiter informed me that it had been taken off the menu four months ago. Disappointed, I settled for calamari and my boyfriend ordered the fish. To our dismay, both dishes lacked flavor and were incredibly bland. Even the prime rib, which had a soft black crust, had zero taste. On a positive note, the service was excellent, but that was not enough to make up for the subpar meal. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this establishment. It's a shame because with such a prime location and attentive staff, the food should match the standards. I was truly disappointed and will not be wasting my money here again. "

I have mixed feelings about The Southern Bar. On one hand, the recent refurbishment has definitely made it a more modern and attractive space. On the other hand, the prices have gone up and it's no longer as affordable for students. The ambiance is still great though, with live bands performing and creating a lively atmosphere. The staff are always friendly and welcoming, and the bar is usually a decent size so you can usually find a seat. However, beware on Friday and Saturday nights as it does get very busy and it's best to arrive early to secure a spot. The food is tasty, especially the burgers, and there are plenty of snacks available. However, the prices are a bit steep compared to other bars in the area, but fortunately they do offer student discounts. My biggest complaint about The Southern Bar though is their false advertising. They claim to have great meal deals and be open until late, but when I tried to order at 4am, they didn't answer the phone. This disappointed me and lowered my rating for this place. Overall, it's a decent spot to grab a bite to eat and enjoy some live music, but don't rely on their advertised late hours."

The seafood gumbo at Jason's Deli definitely looked appetizing, but unfortunately, the experience did not match the expectation. Despite being warned about its spiciness, the gumbo turned out to be quite mild and lacking in flavor. In addition, the portion size of the quarter-muff DEAL was deceivingly small, leaving us still feeling hungry after the meal. We were also disappointed to find out that the free soft-serve ice cream was only available to dine-in customers, something that we were not informed of beforehand. Overall, the lunch experience at Jason's Deli was underwhelming and we will not be returning. "

I have been a loyal member of this car wash for my sedan for quite some time now, and it has become one of my go-to weekend activities. The membership perks are definitely worth it - a complimentary air freshener, a wipe for the interior, and free use of their vacuums. Plus, you can even drive through more than once for that extra shine. However, I do have some minor gripes about this place. The biggest issue is the lack of staff, which results in longer wait times and a very crowded atmosphere. With only four locations, it's no surprise that it can get pretty hectic. It's not just the adults though, as some families seem to think this is a playground for their kids. I've had to dodge a few children playing with the vacuum hoses and even ended up with a door ding from an unaware patron. If the parking stalls were just a little bit wider, I'm sure this issue could be avoided. Overall, this car wash is convenient and provides a good service, but I have seen other locations that do a better job at maintaining a more enjoyable experience."
214,"The service was good and the atmosphere is nice...but the food...a joke. We ordered the rib eye, the chorizo, the sauteed shrimp and the steak tar tar to start....and to end. We took a few bites and realized we had to go somewhere else and eat pronto. The rib eye was 2 slices of a decent steake but verrrry fatty...and that was the best part of the meal. The chorizo was less stellar than Jimmy Dean and i dont even eat that garbage. The shrimp tasted like it went from the freezer to the microwave in bacon fat. And the tar tar... which my friend ordered and he has worked in some of the finer NY restaurants including Ciprianis.. was laughable. When the waiter came to ask if we needed anything more we said the check and the nearest decent restaurant. I said the \""chef should be demoted to bus boy\"". He summoned his manager who was nice enough but insisted that his chef was \""one of the best in spain\"". Insert laughter here. Ok well congratulations to him but this food was nothing but overpriced. He comped the two dishes we left on the plate (which was not our intention) and apologized but we left hungry and very disappointed. And btw i have been to Spain and the food there is not spectacular as rule but the great Tapas places are all about quality which this place lacks."
215,"Literally anyone with taste buds and a digestive system can make it work at Ghengis. At one restaurant, you could walk away from the grill holding a bowl of....\n1. Curried fried rice with shrimp, egg, & sprouts\n2. Honey soy brown rice with spinach, tofu, broccoli and carrots\n3. White rice with teriyaki beef, sesame and scallions\n4. Udon noodles with peanut sauce, pork, onions, and snap peas\n5. Rotini noodles with roasted tomato sauce and sausage\n6. Tortillas filled with BBQ chicken, onions, and peppers\n7. Some disgusting combination of any/all of the above, plus calamari and some congealed sauce that was accidentally poured onto the food instead of into the sauce cup.\n\nThe endless possibility offers some novel appeal and exciting promise of your own creation, but it also makes it exceptionally difficult to know what will pair nicely together unless you're an experienced Ghengis-goer or you can already cook (and if you can already cook, what the deuce are you doing at Ghengis Grill?) Plus, if you do succumb to being overwhelmed by choices and your food sucks, it's your fault. Then, there's always the chance that your food sucking is not your fault... on two separate occasions, the chef has broken my egg before cooking it and just served me my dish, sans egg. What is fried rice without the egg? NOTHING.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for somewhere to eat with a rather diverse group of uncultured people (or a lot of children) everyone can find something to eat for a 10 dollar flat rate. However, if you've got even an inkling of gastronome in you, don't expect to be impressed."

We walked into one of the monorail hotels thinking the monorail station was going to be close to the entrance we had entered. WRONG!!!

We might have been better walking back to the hotel since we were about a mile away anyway!\n\nThen, after we had walked through a mile in the hotel's casino, we were SHOCKED to find that the monorail is now $5!!!!! That's more expensive than Chicago's public transit system! We were not happy. This thing used to be free!!!! I guess the economy is really hitting Vegas hard.\n\nThe overall monorail ride is great.

The hype surrounding this location is completely unwarranted. After hearing rave reviews about the long lines and popular shakes, my excitement for Steak n' Shake quickly dwindled as I took my first bite. My burger was dry and flavorless, and the fries were a disappointment with no seasoning in sight. It's no wonder why we were able to walk right up to the takeout line. And don't even get me started on the wait time just to get our food. With so many other dining options available, it's a mystery to me why anyone would waste their time lining up for such subpar food. The only redeeming factor was the unbeatable $1.50 beer, but even that couldn't save my experience. Save yourself the calories and opt for Plan A next time - just about anywhere else."

My friends and I were excited to check out Last Chance for some bargain shopping on our trip to the city. We were impressed by their selection of shoes and I especially loved their skirts. However, our excitement quickly turned to chaos when we realized the intense competition at this store. At one point, they called out my shoe size and I felt like I was in the middle of a stampede! The employees do their best to keep things under control, but with so many people in such a small space, it can get overwhelming. I will say, they definitely have some amazing deals, but I wish they had more staff to help with the chaos. Despite the craziness, I still enjoy shopping here and always find great deals. So just remember to wear your Kevlar vest and be prepared for the madness when you visit Last Chance!"

I have mixed feelings about this place. While the service was great and the prices were reasonable, the food just didn't hit the mark for me. I ordered a variety of dishes, including their famous walnut shrimp which was just okay and nothing special. I was most looking forward to their orange beef, but it was a huge disappointment. The meat was chewy and the batter was definitely soggy, which was a huge turnoff. The vegetable stir fry was a safe bet, but that's probably because it's hard to mess up such a basic dish. However, I was annoyed when we were charged an extra dollar for requesting brown rice instead of white rice. And to top it off, the milk tea with boba was a letdown. The boba was clearly not fresh and had a hard texture, making it difficult to enjoy. As much as I hate to say it, I probably won't be returning here. I have had much better experiences at other restaurants and this place just didn't meet my expectations. However, I can understand why others might enjoy their food, especially if they like a sweeter sauce on their pizza, which is just not my preference. Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't great either."

I had high hopes for this Chinese restaurant after hearing rave reviews from friends, but unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. The service was lackluster, with the server barely making an appearance at our table after taking our initial order. It seemed like the entire restaurant was empty, yet we still had to wait forever for our food and drink refills. \n\nSpeaking of the food, it was a major disappointment. The meat in our dishes was tough and fatty, and it was clear that cheap cuts were being used. Not to mention, the prices were exorbitant for the mediocre quality. To add insult to injury, they charged us $4.35 for a bowl of rice that was initially offered as a complimentary side dish. \n\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The combination of subpar food and rushed, inattentive service made for a truly unpleasant dining experience. It's safe to say that I will not be returning here."

Not the best ones I've had considering there's no lettuce or tomato included, but not bad. Lots of peppers and onions. \nThe carnitas burrito (enchilada style) is something I would definitely pass on. The meat was extremely bland and there wasn't any wet sauce that you could expect on an enchilada style burrito. \nI would give them a 3.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm not necessarily dying to go back. The quality just wasn't quite there, but at the price point it's still a value."

So when we first got checked in, we went to our room...We laid on the bed to relax after being on the road...after about 30 minutes of relaxing, we hear a knock at the door..but before my husband could open the door, a Mexican lady BUSTS into our room !! She started waving her hands around in the air and was speaking Spanish to us. We were in utter disbelief! So..if that wasn't bad enough, she picks up our phone, makes a phone call (to who, I don't know), she is speaking Spanish to whoever it is she is speaking to on the phone..She got off of the phone, said something to us in Spanish and LEFT! Me and my husband were really STUNNED.. So, once we got our bearings together, we called the front desk to complain. The girl that I spoke to apologized and said that she'd talk to the maid that came in our room. Ok..so the room...it was minimally clean..the porcelain in the tub was not sparkling..the decor was meh.. the room smelled musty. The price of the room was high IMO compared to other hotels in the area considering the quality of the room. So, to make matters worse..their were teenagers running up and down the halls ALL NIGHT..So, I finally call security (which I've never done in my life while staying at a hotel, I can bare some noise, after all it's Vegas, but this was ridamndiculous) they FINALLY responded to my call and when they did, they knocked on their door. (I can hear them) and they said \""The folks next to you called and complained and said you were too loud. Please keep it quiet\"",  so all I could think is GREAT.. This dummy has now told these people who outed them! I would have preferred to be anonymous, especially me knowing nothing about who I am next to.  It truly could have been anyone that complained because they were just that loud...So  I asked if I could switch rooms after this, they told me that I couldn't.. I was like..\""WONDERFUL\"" .  So we bared with it.. We had also asked for an extra blanket for our bed at one point...I kid you not, it took about 2hrs for them to bring it.. They woke us out of our sleep by the time they finally brought  it up... Also, the area surrounding the casino is SUPER shady..make sure you carry your switchblade with you if you plan to walk the streets in that area!!! The casino floor is nice here and the Level 7 club is classy, the breakfast buffet was decent. (We got free passes)  But I definitely wouldn't stay here again. I've stayed at less pricey places and had a much better experience. I'd go to one of the hotels downtown before I'd stay here again!"

My I felt the portion was pretty large and I didn't end up finishing it- but don't think I wasn't charged!

My experience at this ranch market was sadly disappointing. I have been a loyal customer for eight years, but the recent changes have left me questioning whether or not to continue my patronage. Let me explain why. 

First and foremost, the quality of the food has declined significantly. I purchased my usual pack of tortillas, expecting them to last a week as they always have. However, to my dismay, they started growing mold after only three days. This has never happened before and it was truly unacceptable. I hope management takes note of this and looks into improving the freshness and longevity of their products. 

Secondly, the service during my breakfast visit was subpar. The guy behind the counter seemed annoyed when we asked for eggs, as if he only wanted us to buy pre-made items. In the past, the employees were always accommodating and willing to cook whatever we requested. It's disappointing to see such a shift in attitudes. To make matters worse, an employee actually walked straight into me without even apologizing. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and a major red flag. 

I used to love coming to this ranch market, but with the decline in food quality and poor service, I am not sure I will be returning. It's a shame to see such a beloved establishment fall from grace. I hope the management takes steps to address these issues and regain the consistency and excellence that they once had. As for me, I may have to explore other options.

Our servers name was Denise got everyone's drink orders and took our dinner orders.\n\nDenise seemed to disappear for long periods of time instead of being attentive to our beverage refills. All  in all I guess her service was OK. If the place was busy I would be more forgiving but it wasn't. All in all Denise was very sweet and friendly.\n\nOn a good note I ordered the Tilapia Florentine ( two delicately seasoned tilapia filets, resting on a bed of spinach tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce and served with creamy mashed potatoes) I asked for a vegetable instead of the mashed potatoes). When my dish arrived I did not see the menu said my Tilapia came in a  Alfredo sauce. I asked what the sauce was and Denise told me ad asked \""Why didn't I want the Alfredo sauce  \"" I replied I didn't see it was in a sauce\"", She asked if I'd like it without the sauce and brought me a new Tilapia dish with no problems or attitude. \n\nWhat can I say? It's IHOP. Need I say more? Everyone else in my group enjoyed their meals. Sometimes you are in the mood for IHOP like food we were. Our expectations were met and IHOP didn't disappoint us.\n\nFOOD: I don't expect much from these types of restaurants so it's a hard to let me down when I eat there. The food is OK nothing special but It hit the spot. SERVICE: We liked the service that was given to us. The restaurant accommodated our party of  10 no problem.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient. CONCLUSION: The food was  good, typical IHOP food. No complaints on that at all. You get exactly what you expect. IHOP is IHOP, Its laid back, casual dining. The experience is better when you're with friends. The menu is the same everywhere. RETURN FACTOR: 100%]\n\n************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT"
227,"Overall, the best sound setup for jazz in the city.\nThe food leaves something (dinner somewhere else) to be desired, the drinks are tiny and the covers are high.\nBut - I've seen consistently good music here. Either the owner is an avid jazz fan or just knows what talent is and books it.\n\nOther jazz clubs in Montreal keep a tight leash on their rotation so you end up seeing the same acts again and again. Upstairs Jazz keeps a good mix of Canadian and international musicians in an unpredictible line-up. This fact alone keeps me coming back to find my seat at the bar for at least two sets, sometimes all three."
228,I am a loyal Einsteins customer so it pains me to leave a negative review but this is literally the worst location. The food is still up to par every time I've been but the customer service is awful and unprofessional it also feels a little dirtier and less kept them most locations. It wasn't all bad there was one employee who almost seemed embarrassed for the rest. I still love Einsteins  but will not be coming to this one again. Very unfortunate.

I was thrilled to discover this medical practice that offers same-day appointments. The convenience factor alone is worth mentioning. The front desk staff are always welcoming and make you feel at ease, which is a huge plus when it comes to scheduling medical appointments. During my visit, I was thoroughly impressed with the cleanliness and spaciousness of the office. It was a refreshing change from the cramped waiting areas I've experienced at other practices. While I appreciate the quality of care provided by my doctor, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by the size of their portions. I had hoped for a bit more, especially considering the cost. Another minor letdown was the parmesan cheese used in some of the dishes. As a fan of Italian cuisine, I was hoping for some fresh, grated parmesan instead of the bottled variety. Overall, I would recommend this practice for its convenient scheduling and friendly staff, but it may not be the best option if you're looking for top-notch Italian food."

This place may not be the fanciest or most upscale, but it sure is convenient. Located just down the street from my house, Smith's has been my go-to for all my late night needs. Whether it's a quick trip for some milk or a more random craving for pepperjack cheese (no, I was not pregnant), Smith's has never let me down. And don't even get me started on their deals - two for five bucks on namebrand cereals? Yes, please! Plus, with their rewards card, I always get discounts on gas which is a huge plus. And let's not forget about the dedicated staff who work the swing and grave shifts to keep this place running 24/7. I may not have noticed before, but it really does take a lot of dedication to work those hours. So while Smith's may not be the most glamorous store around, it's definitely a staple in my book."
231,"My folks love this place and took me there for breakfast last weekend.  I must assume that it was just a bad day but the way the handled it tells me I wont go back.\n\nWe sat for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down a waitress who then told us that though this was not her section (every table around ours was somehow) that she would still help us.\n\nWe placed our order and 30 minutes later, we got our breakfast...cold, overcooked and tasteless.  Our poached eggs where hard cooked, the omelets dark brown from burn, hollandaise that was tasteless and runny. We voiced our complaints and where told that the kitchen was having a bad day but no form of atonement was offered.  I really don't think we should have had to pay fully for our meal or at least a free drink or something to say \""I'm sorry for your crap meal but come back and we will prove we don't completely suck\"""
232,"

Honestly, I had high hopes for this place, but it just didn't live up to the hype. The atmosphere was lackluster, almost reminiscent of a dingy Denny's. The lighting was dim and quite honestly, it was a bit annoying. I tried to flag down a waiter or waitress multiple times to get my check, but it seemed like they were all deliberately ignoring me. It took a solid 10 minutes just to get someone's attention and another 5 to finally get my bill.

Plus, let's talk about the food. I ordered their famous pastrami sandwich, but it was nothing special. Just your average pastrami sandwich that you can get at any deli. Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but the lack of a line should have been a red flag.

Will I be returning to this place? Definitely not. Will I be recommending it to friends? Not a chance. And as for those Instagram-worthy food pics? This place was far from it. I'll stick to the original location in NY, thanks."

This buffet was a huge disappointment. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a decent meal. Instead, I was greeted with dried out, overcooked, and heavily seasoned meats. Not to mention, the lack of kid-friendly options, such as chicken tenders and fries, left my little one munching on cheese slices. The fruit selection was lackluster, adding to the overall disappointing experience.

To make matters worse, we were forced to return for breakfast due to a late start and our location. While breakfast did offer a few more options, they were still serving the same overcooked meats from the night before. The addition of wet scrambled eggs and stale cereal did not make up for it. However, my daughter did enjoy the pancakes and blueberries, giving at least some redemption to the meal.

I must say, the staff were friendly, earning one star from me. And the pecan tart from the dessert station was delicious, earning the second star. But overall, this buffet did not meet my expectations, and I would not recommend it to anyone."
234,"

While I wasn't particularly impressed with the food at this restaurant, what really ruined the experience for me was the attitude of the owner. From the moment I walked in, I could tell that he was a bit wound up. Turns out, I had witnessed him throwing a tantrum at a nearby OfficeMax just moments before. It was then that I noticed his car, proudly labeled with the name of his restaurant, and I thought to myself, ""Well, that's one way to advertise.""

I ordered some ribs and a pulled pork sandwich, and while the ribs were decent, the pulled pork was dry and bland. When I asked for some extra sauce, I was met with a side of attitude instead. It's a shame, because a little bit of kindness and good customer service can go a long way in making a meal enjoyable, but unfortunately, the food spoke for itself. I couldn't help but think about the display I had seen at the store earlier and how it seemed to reflect onto the food and the overall experience at the restaurant. Needless to say, I won't be returning."
235,"Gonna make this short. Told the waiter it was my birthday. It was my 21st. Our bill was over 400$ and it was for three people. The price i don't care about. But just because there is a party of 20 next to us does not mean you can simply ignore us. I asked for lemons literally 4 times. Asked for bread 3 times. He couldn't explain ANYTHING on the menu that we asked him for. And he charged me for an extra drink \""by accident\"". I don't know if the server thought I was an idiot or if I was just naive but I work at a shitty little hole in the wall on LA and my manager would be livid if he knew we ignored a guest who spent a good amount. The servers name was Juan and I will make sure to avoid this place next time passing through the Luxor."
236,"There's a snack bar in the back of Mermaids that sells two culinary masterpieces, in the same genre as the dearly departed Ho Dog: a deep fried Twinkie, and deep fried Oreos.  Both were covered in a thick layer of heavy batter.  The Oreos had a bit of chocolate flavor.  The Twinkie's creamy center helped enhance an otherwise nondescript piece of fried dough.  I was a little disappointed.  They were neither good enough nor bad enough to be memorable."
237,"Lately I've been eating at a lot of buffets. Everyone pretty much has the same items so I've started creating my own dishes from what I'm presented with.  I've already liked this buffet.  This one time I came here for a Sunday Brunch, I got full on all their usual breakfast dishes.  Looking for something different I discovered my new addiction by mistake, it's brisket in miso soup with green onion FTW it's so freaking good. At the carving station I asked for a piece of brisket it already looked good. I grabbed a bowl to put au jus into, which is usually next to the carving station, but it was miso soup instead and since I didn't want to waste the miso soup I added green onion just as your suppose to and was going to finish it after the brisket. I ended up dunking pieces of brisket into the miso soup and loved it.  I went back for 2nds and 3rds. I've been back 2 more other times just looking for miso soup and brisket.  The last time they had brisket and hid the miso soup in another section. I found it and enjoyed just plates of it. Trust me forget the rest of the item and just do brisket and miso soup with green onion unless it's crab legs but even on those nights I might just do it only.\n\nThey place gets busy and lines do get long but I don't think any of them know about this brisket and miso soup combination haha."

This store has a decent selection of products and I was able to find exactly what I needed for my bridal party. However, the customer service left a lot to be desired. When I called to ask about store hours, I was met with a quick and unenthusiastic response. And when I got to the store, I experienced some interesting behavior from the associates. One employee didn't seem too thrilled to be bothered on their break and the cashier seemed more concerned with chatting than helping customers. But, I have to say, I was impressed with the club membership that I signed up for based on other yelp reviews. It was definitely worth the $5 fee, especially since I got some great coupons to use later. Overall, the store has what you need, but be prepared for less than stellar customer service."

When I first walked into City Tavern, I was hit with a familiar aroma, which immediately had me reminiscing about my travels to Mexico. I couldn't help but feel excited for what was to come. The packed tables and crowds of people waiting to be seated only added to my anticipation. As it turns out, I was in for a treat, but not exactly the one I had hoped for. Instead of authentic Mexican cuisine, I found myself in a small town in Arizona, where the food was a far cry from the vibrant flavors of New York. But as I took a bite of the wings, I couldn't help but feel disappointed as they tasted like they had been frozen and reheated. The small salad was decent, but nothing to write home about. And the pizza? Let's just say it was average at best. But the biggest letdown was the ""bolognese,"" which was just a simple marinara sauce with some meatballs thrown in. I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt as I struggled to give City Tavern a 3-star review. After all, I wanted to support the local restaurant and its owner, but I had to draw the line somewhere. Maybe I'm just not as familiar with Arizona cuisine, but if this is the best it has to offer, then I am truly sorry. But all is not lost at City Tavern. When the food is good, it's really good. The salsa, for example, is sometimes chunky, sometimes blended, but always delicious. And those sandwiches with the perfectly toasted bun? Pure perfection. Yes, there may be some inconsistencies in the food, but isn't that what keeps things interesting? Overall, City Tavern is a decent spot for a meal, just be prepared for some risks when ordering."
240,"My first time here. My husband visited a couple of weeks ago and loved it.  He thinks it is better than Pita Jungle, but I am neutral. I had the chicken supreme. The chicken was delicious but I was not a fan of the reddish sauce on the beans.  I am not sure what it was, but the flavor did not appeal to me and it was also used on the grilled veggies. Hubby LOVES those. We also had the chicken quesadilla which was pretty tasty. The salad was really fresh and the lemon vinaigrette was very nice. Small little place, and it was a little warm inside. Only fountain iced tea which is a strike for me. Food was not knock your socks off, but ok so it will not be a place I am dying to eat at all the time."
241,"By reading and asking around, we got APDC recommended, so I made a reservation. We expected a great night out with marvelous food, but no! Everything they served was greasy and fat. My husband and my father ordered the pork tenderloin, which needed to be prepared for an hour? And it was such a setback! Only a big piece of meat on your plate. Red cabbage was drown in the grease, horrible! They took three bites and didn't finished it.  I had the salmon, which wasn't great either and my mom had happy pork chop, was ok. For these prices, we eat in Manhattan a great dish! \n\nAlso the people next to us gave back their food, not a good sign.\n\nDon't go here!! There are so many other great restaurants you can go."

I'll give credit where credit is due - the price was definitely the determining factor in choosing this car rental place. And for that, I can't complain too much. You do get what you pay for, after all. And let me tell you, we definitely got an experience like no other. 

First of all, let's talk about the car. It was some sort of beat-up Ford with over 58K miles on it. I mean, I'm all for a little adventure, but this was ridiculous. My husband compared it to Barney Rubble's car, and I couldn't have said it better myself. And can we talk about the air conditioning? It was like a sauna in there. Definitely not the kind of babe-magnet car I was hoping for. 

Now, let's talk about the return process. O. M. to the G. It was a complete disaster. No clear lines, no clear organization, just pure chaos. It took us a good 45 minutes just to check out. And let me tell you, I have never felt more like I was at a welfare office instead of a car rental place. And that's saying something. 

But the real kicker was the ""airport shuttle"" situation. After finally getting on the shuttle, the driver randomly drops off two Korean ladies at CVS. I couldn't help but laugh - it was like a bad movie. And then we find out that we have to get off at some random station, cross the street, and find a guy in a green vest to tell us which shuttle to take to the airport. Are you kidding me? It was like a scavenger hunt just to get to the airport. 

I understand that some people may be willing to put up with these inconveniences for a lower price, but my time is valuable and I definitely won't be coming back here. I'll gladly pay a little extra for a more organized and stress-free experience. But hey, at least it made for some great comic relief. And I can honestly say I've never experienced anything like this before. "
243,"I ate here on a Sunday night.... Here is the low down. It's a damn good burger, I can't give it \""great,\"" and I wouldn't go too far out of your way for it, but if it's convenient and you're looking for something better than fast food, and you don't want to eat upscale (because all you really want is a burger) then this is your spot. Pretty expensive, but if your eating in Vegas and searching for \""a better burger\"" then you ready for these prices. It's a safe call that probably won't change your life."
244,"This particular branch leaves much to be desired! The service felt very rushed....in fact, the server was preoccupied with other things, and not only pushy, but quite argumentative. He checked on us twice, once to take our order (which he rushed through) and once to collect our money. The food was very bland, and the toast was charred when it was served. Not a good breakfast choice with so many other options in the area."
245,"While we did have a large party on a friday night we expected the wait to be a bit long... but not 50 minutes... then it took forever to get our drinks. We got no crayons for the kids even after we asked. It took 30 mins to get the appetizers & salads... Im not sure if the waitress was just overwhelmed but we got only 1 refill and that wasnt until the manager came over with our dinners which was served to adults first then kids 5 minutes later... overall I think this was the worst experience we have ever had at a Chili's... the 2 stars is soley for the food, which was good ..."

247,"This was our first and last time to Liberty Market.\n\nWe ordered the biscuits and gravy and a side of liberty potatoes. It was a lot of food, which my wife and I split. We were impressed with the biscuits and gravy, they were pretty good. The liberty potatoes were very salty and greasy.\n\nAt the conclusion of eating the breakfast, my wife took a look at her Coke which came from the fountain, more specifically she looked at the glass, and there were bugs on the inside of the glass. Initially we thought that it was just a dirty glass. We looked closer, the bugs were alive and moving!\n\nAs we were examining the glass a waiter came by and asked if we had ants in our soda! We looked closer and they were ants! He apologized and took the glass and we saw him go over to the soda fountain to examine the soda nozzle. I then took a closer look at the Coke I was drinking, ANTS! Yup, they were in my glass too! And I had already drank two glasses!\n\nThe waiter came back over and said that he was going to comp our meal. I told him that it was in my glass too. He apologized asked for the bill to go and comp our meal. The problem was that while he was away another customer went to that same Coke nozzle and filled up her glass.\n\nHe came back with the comp'ed meal. We were disgusted, a little queasy, thanked him and left.\n\nThe problem was, as we were discussing after we had left the restaurant, the waiter seemed to already know what the problem was when he came up and asked if there was ants in the soda. And the fact that even he found out that there were ants in our soda he did nothing to prevent the lady who filled up her drink from the same nozzle!\n\n\""Joe\"" may be cool about insects crawling around on his food on the farm, but they need to be kept out of the sugary soda!"

This place definitely has a certain charm to it. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something about Enso just screams fancy and upscale. The dim lighting, plush seating options, and modern yet traditional decor all contribute to the overall ambience. It's the perfect spot for a romantic date or to impress clients. However, when it comes to the food, I must admit I was a bit underwhelmed. As others have mentioned, there are definitely better sushi options in town. The specialty rolls, while priced as if they're something truly special, left much to be desired. Loose rolls and warm fish aren't exactly what I look for in a sushi experience. But let's not forget about the service. While the waitstaff are attentive enough to ensure a decent tip, there's a certain lack of personality that I can't quite put my finger on. It's almost as if they were trained to simply go through the motions without really engaging with patrons. All in all, Enso is a solid option for its ambiance, but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for the food or service."
249,This place used to be really good for pizza and fingers they have gotton skimpy on the toppings and the fingers are small plus there prices went up! the fingers hardly had any sauce and they were the chunky fat ones not the big flat ones! they must have changed owners or something.
250,"The late night diner that comes with a side of adventure. \n\nThe food is your standard diner fare but the atmosphere is what gives this place its charm, especially if this is a late night stop for you. If you come here right after bars close, expect to stand in line for 20-30 mins, more if you have a group larger than 2-3. \n\nFood is not bad but there is always something going on at the diner. When I went last time, there was some scuffle that occured on the outside. Usually it is just how drunk people are but being from the south it was somewhat entertaining to watch. \n\nThe staff is friendly and courteous and the space is somewhat small but works for a late night stop."

Food is bar food so take what you get. I will say they have some of my favorite ranch dressings though, love to dip my fries in it! Slather anything up with that ranch and it's delish! To be safe I usually stick to chicken tenders or cheese sticks. $1 domestic beers on Wed...can't beat that! (Though I'll stick to my Old Meck) they have an assortment to at least satisfy your thirst. They have a drink special everyday, and one weekday a good deal on crab legs. Bathroom needs a good scrub...but like I said, it's a dive bar! Expect to bring your own Lysol LOL\nCome visit :))"

But of course its gone now, And A lot of the items on the menu are run of the mill Asian fast food on fancy plates in a fancy setting.. Pretty much FAIL.. I would recommend avoiding.. Too Many good chinese places in Las Vegas to waste your time on these clowns. Although I must say the service is always on point at this location, They have some servers that should be working in a real award winning restaurant."

I had been looking forward to my first experience at H.B for a while, especially after hearing about their great DJs. However, unfortunately, I didn't even get a chance to experience any of that. Upon arriving, I was told it would be a 10 minute wait. No problem, I thought. But after coming back 15 minutes later, I was given the same response. And even after waiting an additional 10 minutes, I was still told I had 2 names ahead of mine. 

While waiting, I couldn't help but notice that there were plenty of empty seats inside. I even suggested to the hostess that they could bring people inside and offer them drinks at least. But the response I received was that it was ""just what my manager said.""

Feeling disappointed and frustrated, I ended up calling Citizen Public House, and they were able to accommodate me right away. It was a Monday, so I was surprised to see that H.B was so understaffed. It could have easily been corrected if they had just offered me a drink at the bar while I waited, or even just apologized for the delay. But instead, I was left feeling like my patronage wasn't valued.

I won't be giving H.B another chance, as this first impression left a bad taste in my mouth. It's a shame, because I had high hopes for their DJ nights, but I guess I'll have to check out Bar Smith instead. I have a feeling they know how to do it right."

In my dining experience at Typhoon, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed. I had high expectations for this restaurant after hearing rave reviews from friends and the overall ambiance seemed promising. However, upon receiving my first dish after a 45-minute wait, I was immediately underwhelmed. The mussels were decent, but it seemed to be the best dish of the night. I ordered the duck breast as my main entree, which was supposed to be the star of the dish, but unfortunately, it was overpowered by the intensely salty basil sauce. The flavors were all out of balance, and I couldn't even taste the duck itself. I ended up eating more rice than usual just to cleanse my palate from the overwhelming saltiness. And for a $40+ per person meal, I expected much more in terms of taste and quality. The waitstaff were warm and welcoming, but that alone couldn't save the overall disappointing experience. If you're looking for a place with great decor and ambiance, Typhoon might be a good option. However, if you're looking for a delicious and well-balanced meal, I would have to say I cannot recommend this restaurant. I hope they can improve the flavors in their dishes to match the inviting atmosphere. "

I've always been told that Joanns/Michael's coupons are interchangeable and I have never had a problem in all the years I have been shopping there.  I had a 20% off of my entire purchase.  I didn't have much, in fact my total was only about $16.  I hadn't the cashier my coupon. She tried to scan it, but it didnt work.  I had to have her look at it and remind her it was from Joanns.  She then tells me I can't use it for my whole purchase, she will only take it off of the last item she rung up.  I asked her why because the coupon states the entire purchase and nothing I had was clearance.  She told me it was company policy and that she would call her manager.  The manager came and still said she would not honor the Joanns coupon after I had just watched her approve a refund for a customer in front of me that was clearly returning a used item with no receipt.  I had used this type of coupon at another Michaels before with no problem and no mention of this policy.  I informed her of this.  She told me I was more than welcome to go and try to make my purchase at another Michael's if they were willing to break company policy.  I do not believe she spoke properly to me as a customer.  Her customer service skills were definitely lacking.  I did not make that purchase and I went to Joanns down the street from this location.  This manager's treatment is definitely going to influence my decision to walk through the doors of that stood anytime soon."

Although my husband and I were initially excited to try this Indian buffet for lunch, our experience was unfortunately not up to par. Upon entering, we were met with a manager or owner who seemed far more engrossed in his phone call than in welcoming us. In fact, he simply gestured for us to sit with his chin, completely ignoring us. The lack of basic hospitality was disappointing, to say the least. 

To make matters worse, the restaurant had an overall dark and unwelcoming atmosphere. It seemed like none of the lights were even turned on, with only a small amount of natural light filtering in. As someone who believes that a pleasant environment can enhance the dining experience, this was a definite letdown. 

As for the food itself, it was adequate but not exceptional. Nothing stood out to us as particularly delicious or noteworthy. However, the real kicker was when the same manager brought us some naan and unceremoniously tossed it onto our table as he walked by, still completely absorbed in his phone call. It was a strange and uncomfortable interaction, to say the least. 

Overall, our visit to this restaurant was underwhelming and unmemorable. While the buffet was fine, it was not enough to make up for the lack of hospitality and ambiance. Sadly, we will not be returning to this establishment."
257,"I had lunch on Friday, July 8 2011. They changed the menu. Horrors of horrors.  The salad that was perfect , farmers , was a soggy mess with too much dressing.  The bread, which was perfect,is now a tasteless brown bread. They are re branding to health food, why? Why not french style. Perfect fresh food cooked well? The salad was filled with tiny grains of quoina, if you like to have a million tiny grains stuck in your teeth this is the salad for you. Also, raw green beans.....WTF?\nThe manager was nice but fox is on a downslide. Probably getting ready to go public. Too bad another chain with mediocre food."

I've been a loyal customer of Apple for years, but I have to say, their retail customer service is a major letdown. Every time I walk into this store, I can feel my frustration levels rising. The ""geniuses"" they have working here really leave much to be desired. It's almost as if they don't care about actually helping customers, and would rather chat with each other or stare at their phones.

And don't even get me started on the rest of the employees. Slow and lacking any sense of urgency would be an understatement. It's like they don't even notice you when you walk in. I've waited for an eternity just to ask a simple question or make a purchase.

Now, don't get me wrong, I love Apple products. But the poor customer service here just taints the whole experience. I probably won't be rushing back here anytime soon, unless there's a new product release or something. And even then, I'll probably opt for online shopping to avoid the headache of dealing with these ""geniuses"". Maybe I'll have better luck at a different location, but I'm not holding my breath."

""This store in Planet Hollywood is definitely convenient for grabbing snacks and drinks while staying at The Cosmopolitan. However, I was not impressed with the prices. A simple bottle of water costs more than double what it would at a regular convenience store. Even the selection of juices and alcohol was overpriced.

The store at Planet Hollywood did have a good selection of wine, beer, and spirits, as well as cute souvenirs and daily essentials.

My visit to this establishment after a tech event at Google unfortunately did not live up to my expectations. While the space itself was visually appealing and had a buzzing atmosphere, the overall experience was quite underwhelming.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was definitely the beer selection, with a unique choice from Anderson Valley that I had not seen in Pittsburgh before. However, the food fell short of impressing us. The pizza, which was highly recommended, was decent but not as exceptional as some of the best I've had in the city. My wife's grilled cheese was a safe choice, but not mind-blowing. Our friend, who had the cauliflower patties, was the most satisfied with her dish, having previously tried and loved it at an event. Thankfully, they had a gluten-free option for her in the form of a hard cider.\n\nWhat truly dampened the experience was the lack of attention and professionalism from the staff. Our server seemed overwhelmed and barely checked in on us, leaving us wondering if we were an inconvenience. To make matters worse, we noticed that the staff who were not actively working were preoccupied with their phones and laptops. It was quite disappointing to have our dining experience overshadowed by this lack of professionalism.\n\nWhile the build-your-own salad options and the cool patio were tempting, the overall noise and distraction level of the restaurant took away from the dining experience. It is a decent spot for large groups and seems geared towards a lively bar scene, but it definitely fell short of meeting our expectations."
261,"Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking. \n\nMy friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it. \n\nGuac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though. \n\nFor lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it. \n\nThroughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were \""free\"" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.  \n\nSo buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx."

I was excited to try this Yogurtland location, being a fan of their frozen yogurt and having visited multiple locations in California. The decor was colorful and clean, reminiscent of a beachy vibe like Rubio's. The service was quick and efficient, similar to Chipotle's style. 

I opted for a classic combination of chocolate and vanilla yogurt with various toppings. However, I was disappointed to find that this location did not offer mango, one of my favorite flavors. Still, the yogurt itself was creamy and delicious, just as I remembered. 

One thing I did find lacking at this location was the lack of popping boba, which I had come to love at other Yogurtland locations. It was a small detail, but one that would have made my experience even better. 

The atmosphere was lively and loud, with music playing over the speakers. It made it difficult to hear the employees when they asked me questions about my order. 

Overall, while I enjoyed my visit to this Yogurtland location, I'm not sure if I'll be returning. The lack of mango and popping boba was a bit of a disappointment, but I still appreciate having a Yogurtland in Vegas. I may give it another try in the future, but for now, I'll stick to my California locations for my fix of frozen yogurt and popping boba. "

The Earl's Club at this restaurant is my absolute must-have whenever I am on the strip and near Planet Hollywood. I first had it in 2011 and have been hooked ever since. The combination of flavors in this sandwich is simply irresistible. However, my recent experience at this restaurant left a little to be desired.

The size of the restaurant is small but cozy, and the staff is always welcoming and friendly. However, there were a few instances where I witnessed some customers being rude to the staff, even while I was waiting in line. I was amazed at how professional and courteous the staff remained, never retaliating in any way.

On this particular visit, I waited over an hour and a half for my sandwich, which is typically made quickly. I understand that things can get hectic in a bustling restaurant like this, but the service was not up to par. The wait for my food was nearly unbearable, especially after a long night of partying on the strip. I found it hard to believe that the reason for the delay was because another waitress took my server's plates. It would have been better if they had simply owned up to forgetting to put in my order.

Despite the service mishap, I still enjoyed the delicious Earl's Club sandwich. I just wished I could have had it in a timely manner and without the long wait. After a night of drinking and dealing with the chaos of the strip, all I wanted was to enjoy my food in peace, pay, and leave a generous tip for the staff who were working hard. In the end, I left satisfied with the sandwich but disappointed with the service."
264,"It's OK.  A smallish airport that is pretty easy to navigate, get your bags and get out.  Relatively well air conditioned which is nice considering the conditions you're likely to face once you step OUTSIDE.  \n\nFairly standard dining and shopping options --  about what you'd expect from a smaller metro airport.  Ample seating it appears."

My friends and I came here for a bachelorette party, excited to try out a popular sushi spot in Vegas. As someone who doesn't eat sushi, I was a bit worried about what I would eat, but my friends assured me that this place was amazing. However, their high hopes quickly turned into disappointment as they found the sushi to be overpriced and unimpressive. They even said they wouldn't come back again on their next Vegas trip. For someone who doesn't eat sushi, my food options were extremely limited with only a few chicken squares or a pricey steak to choose from. I ended up choosing the chicken and some edamame, but it definitely didn't fill me up. Overall, not the best experience and we probably won't be returning."
266,"This was one of my favorite haunts when I lived in South Oakland as a student.  As a poor undergrad, the specials were excellent.  I played darts with my roommates there every Thursday while they drank $5 pitchers of Bud Light and $2 rum and cokes.  I recently revisited Garage Door with my Pitt buddies, and while I would have given it a 4-star review back in the day, I'd give it less now.  It's decent for a college dive, but doesn't hold up for grad students and beyond."

I had a terrible experience at this uniform store. Not only did they have the worst customer service, but they were also dishonest and rude. My frustration began when I was told that the store receives shipments on Fridays, so I made sure to come back on a Friday to purchase my uniforms. Lo and behold, there was no shipment that day. When I asked about it, the employee nonchalantly changed his story and said that shipments actually come in on Wednesdays. Talk about misinformation and inconvenience. The lack of organization and consistency left a bad taste in my mouth.

But wait, it gets worse. When I finally received my uniforms, they were not even the right size. I was told that they ran out of the size I needed and the employee didn't bother to inform me beforehand or offer any solutions. The disrespect and disregard for customers' needs is truly appalling.

And let's not forget about the quality of the uniforms. They were cheap and poorly made, not at all what I expected from a uniform store. The material was thin and easily wrinkled, making me question if they would even withstand a few washes. I couldn't believe I spent my hard earned money at this place.

Overall, this store lacks professionalism and respect for their customers. This experience has left a sour taste in my mouth and I will definitely not be returning. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place at all costs. "

My recent experience at this chocolate shop left me unimpressed, although I do acknowledge that my judgement may have been influenced by the less-than-ideal circumstances. Let me explain why:\n\nIt was a chilly January day, and I was determined to get the perfect photo of the beautiful chocolates in their natural lighting. So there I was, sitting on a snow-covered bench in the center of the outdoor mall, holding my truffle and trying to capture the ideal angle with my phone. I'm sure many passersby were questioning my sanity, but I was focused on getting that picture.\n\nBut then, a powerful gust of wind suddenly swept down and sent my truffle flying into a nearby snowbank. And while some might have given up at this point, I was still determined to get my photo. After digging through the snow and retrieving my truffle, I took a bite with some hesitancy. It was just okay.\n\nOverall, my experience at this chocolate shop was underwhelming. Perhaps my disappointment was due to the chaos of the windy day, but I can't help feeling that the truffle didn't quite live up to its appearance. Maybe it's worth another try under calmer conditions, but I won't go out of my way to visit this shop again."

The first thing I noticed when coming to Coach & Willie's was the lively atmosphere - the perfect spot for sports fans to gather and catch the game. That being said, my initial excitement quickly dissipated once I saw the prices on the menu. While the portions are definitely large and can easily be taken home for leftovers, the quality of the food did not match up to the inflated prices. I've never been able to finish a whole plate here, despite my best efforts. However, I have to give a shout out to their $7 lunch specials - the tuna sandwich is my favorite.

One tip for those getting a salad - be sure to ask for the dressing on the side. It seems like the kitchen tends to be a bit heavy handed with it. As for the drinks, the prices are pretty typical for a sports bar. But for those who want to avoid a hefty tab, I would suggest hydrating before coming in - the water prices here are a bit outrageous. And if you want to keep the party going, be prepared to shell out some big bucks for a sports bottle of booze.

While Coach & Willie's may not have been my favorite sports bar experience, the crowd was definitely lively and there were some good tunes playing thanks to the DJs they bring in. Just be sure to arrive early if you want to secure a spot, as it tends to get really packed. Overall, it's a decent spot, but definitely not my first choice when I'm looking for a fun night out."
270,"If I could give a negative rating, I would. Long story short, bill was more than advertised menu price, brought to managers attention (white lady with blonde hair, think Tanya Harding mid-90s look and you will recognize her) she basically said too bad so sad, I said that's not acceptable for a quesadilla to be on the menu for $16.00 and you try to bill $20.00\n\nShe had no recourse or excuse, provided the bill without a pen. I asked for a pen and a waiter standing around (think Marc Anthony reject) threw a pen at me to sign. I immediately let Aria Conceirege know about the level of service being provided at Javier's and they immediately rectified the situation while letting the food and beverage manager know as well. Food was bland and average, nowhere near caliber of original Javier's in so cal."

Went to this new spot with my teenage kids for an early dinner and show. The concept and atmosphere were really cool, and we were all excited to try their unique taco options. However, our experience was hindered by the lack of great service and underwhelming tacos. The tortillas were too thick and overpowered the delicate fillings, leaving us disappointed with each bite. We ordered a variety of tacos, including Thai, duck, pork adavada, and cherry steak, but unfortunately, the tortilla outshone all of them. I was hoping to savor the amazing flavors in each bite, but instead, they were fleeting and followed by a mouthful of tortilla. 
Despite the disappointing tacos, the younger kids around us seemed to be having a blast, making it the perfect spot for teenagers and their families. The food itself, while just average bar food, was enough to satisfy our hunger. As a mom, dining out with my kids can often be a hassle, but this was one of those rare occasions where there was no fussing or complaining between them - a win in my book! Overall, it was a decent evening, but we were left wishing for tastier tacos and better service."
272,"My wife and I were fortunate to dine hear before the crowd arrived. \n\nAs I mentioned in my review of China Mama, this center is super busy, and the greatest accomplishment is finding a parking space.\n\nWhen we walked in, there was a group of Chinese businessmen in suits, sitting at a large corner table. It almost looked like a scene from an old movie, where the Chinese Mob was planning something in San Francisco.\n\nThat was the highlight of this visit. \n\nThe bottom line is simple: The prices were on the high side for this type of food, and the quality just wasn't worth it. From the hot and sour soup, to the entree and side dishes we ordered, it seemed no better than a \""hole in the wall\"" take out, that re-heats its left overs.\n\nWe were not only disappointed with the food, but the service was less than friendly.\n\nMy friend, Phillip gave this place 5 stars 5 years ago. It must have changed owners, and the new owner is cutting corners to pay for the place. \n\nI will agree with Dave R, and his review. It's worth reading.  \n\nIf you have the good fortune of finding a parking space in this center, continue your good fortune, stay away from this place, and walk over to Q Bistro. Your wallet, and your sense of good taste will thank you!"

Intention Review: This place is a must-visit if you're a fan of country music and American culture. The atmosphere is fun and lively, with hot waitresses dressed in crotchless and a$$less chaps (don't worry, they still wear underwear!), playing country hit music all night long. And let's not forget about the delicious BBQ - the sampler platter is a meatatarian's dream, filled with ribs, pulled pork sliders, wings, and sausage. \n\nUnfortunately, my friend ordered the meatloaf and was disappointed. It was dry and cold, definitely not worth the high price. However, the music and atmosphere made up for it. A live band started playing covers of popular country songs and we ended up staying an hour longer than we planned. \n\nThe decor in this place is top-notch. The entrance even has garage doors with automatic openers, and there are giant guitars hanging from the ceiling. It's like walking into a patriotic dream. And the menu is full of clever country references, like ""freedom fries"" as a side for the burgers. \n\nOverall, I had a great time at this bar, but unfortunately, the food and service just didn't live up to the hype. If you're looking for a fun night out with friends and good music, this is the place to go. But if you're hoping for a satisfying meal, you might want to look elsewhere."

Although I didn't have the best experience here, I'm willing to give them another chance in the future. The staff seemed a bit overwhelmed and unfriendly, but I understand that everyone has off days. I ordered a burger and a drink, and unfortunately, both were not up to par. The woman at the window insisted that my drink was fine, but when I got home, I found mold on my burger bun. Yuck! I immediately threw it away and decided to never return to this fast food joint. Trust me, you don't want to risk getting sick from their lack of hygiene. I will say, their prices were very reasonable, but the quality just didn't match up. Perhaps they were having an off day, but either way, they need to step up their game if they want to keep customers. I hope they take this review as constructive criticism and strive to improve in the future. Fingers crossed that my next visit will be a better one."

As soon as I walked into The Henry, I knew I was in for a memorable dining experience. The atmosphere was cozy and intimate, perfect for a date night out. And let's talk about the food! The cheddar popovers and cauliflower polenta had me salivating before I even took a bite. And let me tell you, each bite was more delicious than the last. Even their vegetable dishes, like the haricot vert, were incredibly flavorful thanks to a generous amount of butter. And don't even get me started on their secret ingredient - ham butter. Somehow, it tasted like melted ham in butter form. Simply divine. \n\nMy prime rib special, which wasn't even on the menu, was out of this world. Perfectly cooked and accompanied by a delicious au jus, it may be the best meat I've ever had at a restaurant. My boyfriend's short rib was a close second, highlighting the consistent quality of the dishes. The prices were reasonable for the exceptional quality of the food, and the fact that each entree came with sides was a nice bonus. \n\nThe drink selection was equally impressive, with unique and tasty cocktails. I highly recommend trying their twist on the Moscow Mule. However, be cautious of the drink prices, as we almost fell for a waiter's upsell to a $180 bottle of wine. Thank goodness for checking the menu first! \n\nThe spacious yet intimate setting, coupled with a large patio perfect for happy hour gatherings with friends, makes The Henry a must-visit in Arcadia. As a local, I am ecstatic to have this gem in my neighborhood. And for those who ask for my restaurant recommendations, The Henry will be at the top of my list. Trust me, you won't regret it. "

This place is a total bust. I decided to check out Rok as it seemed like a fun place to spend my Saturday night. But boy, was I wrong. The door guy was completely disorganized and had no idea about their so-called ""list"". And once inside, I realized that the set-up was nothing special and the crowd was below average. But the real disappointment was the music - it was just all over the place. However, since it smelled like Bourbon Street inside, I decided to escape to the patio. And that's when things started to turn around. The bartender out there was so lively and kept everyone entertained. The music, although random, was actually pretty good and had me moving my feet. And to my surprise, the group of people I was beside - even though they were older and not my usual crowd - were super friendly, making jokes and busting out some moves. It was a pleasant surprise when the Ying Yang Twins took the stage and even though I couldn't make out a word of what they were saying, everyone in the crowd seemed ecstatic. I ended up having a pretty good time and would've given this place four stars, but considering all the other disappointments, a generous two-star rating seems more fitting. Overall, not recommended."
277,"It is what it is, a discount cinema that plays movies that are just about to be released on DVD.  There are no amenities to speak of and the concessions are as expensive as any other theater.  With all that said if you want a fun cheap thing to do in the summer heat in Phoenix this place can't be beat.  The tickets are $3 and even better they are $1.50 on Tuesdays, so if you missed a new release this place can't be beat for a cheap night out."
278,"Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\n\nBit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following."

I used to be a regular at Houston's at the Esplanade - it was my go-to spot for a delicious meal. But ever since they moved to their new location, I have noticed a significant decline in the quality of service. Don't get me wrong, the food is still amazing, I mean, who can resist their grilled artichokes or baby back ribs? But the waiting time has gotten out of hand. Not only that, but our orders were repeatedly forgotten and we had to remind the staff multiple times. It was frustrating to say the least. I used to visit Houston's once or twice a week, but now I am rethinking my loyalty. I really hope they can improve their service soon because I miss the Houston's I used to love."

As a lover of hearty, comfort food, I was excited to try this place out. The atmosphere was cozy and had a nice, Irish pub feel to it. My mouth watered as I saw the menu full of delicious, traditional dishes. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment as the food fell short of my expectations. The Steak & Guinness Stout Boxty, which was recommended to me, was a bit lackluster. The shredded potato cake on top was not as crispy as I had hoped and the steak itself was quite tough. My wife's beef stew also failed to impress, with the serving size being the only redeeming factor. We were both left wanting more flavor and depth in our dishes. Not to mention, the service was subpar. We had to call the server multiple times for refills and they seemed annoyed and distant throughout our meal. It's a shame because we were hoping for a great dining experience. While the concept and atmosphere of this pub are charming, unfortunately, the execution fell short for us. We will most likely not be returning."

But the third time I got the farm salad again and the portion was smaller (I got half size both times) and it just wasn't as good. I also ordered the zucchini fries, which I love but the portions were a lot smaller on my third trip, too... Also on this third trip, the chefs forgot to include avocado for my salad and two other people at my table. They also forgot the avocado on my first trip, too. So I guess watch out for the missing avocado. Hesitant to go back after a poor experience my third time... But the first two times were good...."

I stumbled upon this Thai restaurant on a Sunday in downtown Phoenix when all the other places were closed. It was my only option, so I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, my experience was less than satisfying. My summer roll was a major disappointment. The lettuce was brown and there were only two tiny pieces of tofu inside. I've never actually sent food back before, but this time I had to. Thankfully, my Panang curry was decent, but it didn't make up for the disappointment of the roll. However, the Thai pudding with sticky rice was the highlight of my meal. It was delicious! The staff was friendly and accommodating, which made up for the lackluster food. Overall, I wouldn't give this place a second chance, but if you're ever desperate for Thai food on a Sunday, I suppose it's an option."

I had heard so much about Mineo's Pizza and decided to finally give it a try. The staff was friendly and the interior had a cozy charm to it. But as soon as I took a bite of the cheese pizza I ordered, I was disappointed. The crust was fluffy and the cheese was plentiful, but the overwhelming saltiness completely overpowered the other flavors. I couldn't help but wonder if the high prices were really worth it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad pizza, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe I'll stop in for a slice, but I don't think I'll be paying for a whole pizza again."

Wow, I am so disappointed with this PF Chang's location. We have been loyal customers since the very beginning, but this visit was just terrible. The customer service was severely lacking, to say the least. Our server seemed completely clueless about the drinks from the bar. We asked multiple times if they had T-Ten Gin, but she couldn't seem to find out. It was incredibly frustrating. When we requested a new server, things didn't get any better. Sean, the new server, had a terrible attitude because he had to take over our table. It's astonishing that this is a PF Chang's restaurant. The lack of knowledge and professionalism was just not up to par. This experience has definitely left a bad taste in my mouth and has destroyed any brand loyalty I had. It's truly sad to see such a beloved restaurant chain fail at something as basic as customer service. I really hope changes are made soon. "

My experiences at this coffee shop have been consistently disappointing due to the poor service I have received. Despite giving this place multiple chances in hopes that the service would improve, I have constantly been let down. Firstly, the staff does not even acknowledge you when you walk in, leaving you to stand there awkwardly while they attend to other tasks. Not only is the wait time long, but my coffee is never made to my liking. I prefer my coffee with light cream and 2 splendas, but every time I go there, I am left with a dark and bitter cup. The last time I went, I made sure to check my coffee before leaving and it was still not up to my standards. When I asked for more cream, the server informed me that they were only able to give me a small dab, which did not make a noticeable difference. It was then suggested that I take some small creamers to add myself in my car, which is not only inconvenient but also unsafe. I cannot believe a simple request for a light cup of coffee turned into such a frustrating and unsatisfying experience. As much as I enjoy their coffee and have supported their business by purchasing k cups and bringing in donuts for the staff, the poor service I received during my last visit has led me to conclude that it is time to walk away. It is evident that the manager needs to retrain their staff on the importance of quality customer service. After all, poor service equals poor sales. Think twice before coming here for your caffeine fix."
289,"My drinks seemed to be a little weak and they took a while to get, but I still had a great time there. \n\nOne small request though, get a mirror in the bathroom. Even the most divey-est of dive bars I've been in, have had mirrors to check out how drunk you're looking as the night goes on."
290,"This place terrifies me. When moving into the neighbourhood, we stopped for a drink in here while waiting for the landlord to turn up with the keys. The staff were friendly enough, but this is one of those bars that when you walk in everyone turns silent and looks at you. It is at that point you know this place is not for you. But lets face it, you aren't going to be down this end of town unless you are a local and you are going to be able to suss this place out. It is the definition of a dive bar, dated and hideous decor completes the look. I am sure this place is great for the regulars, but for anyone else... keep walking."

I recently tried this place for delivery and I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed. While the delivery guy was friendly and the food smelled amazing, the actual taste was just okay. We ordered a variety of dishes including fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken, and beef & broccoli. The sides of steamed rice that came with the meats were a nice touch, but unfortunately, the beef in the beef & broccoli had a strange odor and the chow mein was just mediocre. However, the orange chicken and rice were surprisingly tasty. It was definitely better than Panda Express, but we will be skipping the beef & broccoli on our next order. Overall, the service was decent but the food didn't quite meet our expectations."
292,"I've lived around the corner from Shari's Diner (formerly under 2 different names, I think), but I've never been there.  Why?  Well, two reasons:\n\n1. In my eyes, you are not truly a diner if you're not open 24 hours, and Shari's isn't even open late.\n\n2. The place is a kitschy 50's style diner, and I'm not 12.\n\nNonetheless, my girlfriend was in the mood for some pancakes, and this place is so close, we decided to give it a try.  It was WORSE than I thought as far as ambiance.  We showed up on some sort of special night, and they had a DJ that was taking requests for oldies music.  Why do I know this?  Because the creepy owner came over to our table and awkwardly told us so.  On top of that, there are obvious religious ties to this restaurant, and I'd prefer my food without being preached to.\n\nAs for the food, it was delicious, though.  The pancake was one of the best pancakes I've ever had, and I don't even like pancakes all that much.  We also shared some eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy.  All were really good, and our entire meal came out to just over $10.\n\nIf I find myself in the mood for breakfast food and it's early enough, I'll go to the Bagel Cafe.  If I don't mind a drive, I'll go to Blueberry Hill.  If neither of those things work, then I guess I'll be back at Shari's."

The place doesn't look like much from the outside... in fact, I was a little nervous going in, but the inside is nicely decorated. I was a bit disappointed that they had only 2 lunch specials (neither one something I would like) so we had to order off of the dinner menu which was fairly pricey. They don't even give you a salad or anything at lunch (really unusual for a sushi spot) and to order a side salad was $5.50...ridiculous. I ordered gyoza and the spicy scallop hand roll. I have never had a hand roll before, and it was alright, but hard to eat.... I probably wouldn't order one again. The gyoza were the typical gyoza (like frozen), but they fried them so at least they were crispy. My friend said her two rolls were alright. This place wasn't bad, but I don't think I would come here again."

Wow, what a letdown. After hearing so much hype about this place, my husband and I decided to give it a try. We were big fans of Capriotti's, but someone recommended we check out Hougan's. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. The sandwiches were lackluster and overpriced, except for a few rare exceptions. The pastrami sandwich was decent, but the burnt out taste was hardly worth the steep price tag. And don't even get me started on the Thanksgiving All Year Long sandwich - it lacked any real flavor or creativity. Plus, the service was subpar. We had to wait 1.5 hours for our order, and the sandwich artist was too busy chatting to give us proper attention. Save your money and stick with Capriotti's, or better yet, try the sandwiches at the Bridger Inn nearby. Trust me. This place is not worth the hype. We won't be coming back."
295,"Yes, it is a run down, dark and stale room but they host some killer music.  Plus, if I refused to hear like music in old dark venues I would have missed some amazing music in L.A., Chicago, NYC and even here in KC. \n\nI care about the music, so this place did it for me...great night. \n\n I will check out who is playing the next time I am in town."
296,"Had my Taco' in for service five times since I owned it:\n1. First day owning it I was getting an engine warning I found I had no gas cap - they gave me a new one, but forgetting to include a gas cap?  \n2. First week owning I had a tire air pressure warning - took them four visits to fix the leak over a two week period\n3. Oil change with an appointment - took 2 hours while I sat and waited  \n4. Oil change dropped it off  - when I returned it took them a half an hour to find my truck, and they forgot to wash it as offered\n5. Oil change dropped it off  - had to wait over a half hour for the 'valet' to get my truck.  Oh yeah, they forgot to wash as offered again. They asked if I wanted to wait while they 'washed it up'.  I think not.\n\nService here is awful in my experience.  The only reason I gave them a two star is the oil changes are free."

Unfortunately, my experience at this restaurant was not up to par. Despite the pleasant demeanor of the staff, the food was a major disappointment. I ordered the flounder platter with a Greek salad and rice and gravy, but none of the dishes lived up to my expectations. The flounder was overcooked and the breading was tough and tasteless. To make matters worse, the rice was dry and barely had any gravy on it. And don't get me started on the so-called Greek salad. It was lacking in ingredients and hardly resembled a traditional Greek salad. Honestly, I would have been better off frying my own fish at home for a fraction of the price. I'm sorry to say that I won't be returning to this establishment."

299," Unfortunately, I have to say I was very disappointed.\n\nUnfortunately, my dining experience at Urban Tea Loft fell far below my expectations. From the moment we walked in, something just felt off. The seating was a strange mix of couches and booths, and the tables and chairs seemed mismatched. It was not the modern, hip vibe that I had been promised. \nUpon perusing the menu, I was excited to try the Rooibos Chai and some classic soul food options. But when our food arrived, I couldn't believe the tiny portions we received. I ordered the three meatless sides, expecting a satisfying meal, but instead was left hungry and disappointed. \nThe flavors of the food were delicious, but the portion sizes were just not enough to truly enjoy them. And to top it off, our server seemed disinterested and unfriendly. \nI will not be returning to Urban Tea Loft for a dining experience, but I may stop by for a cup of tea if I'm in the area. Overall, a letdown."
300,"Rest assured there is no Egyptian food here or anything close to it.  I once saw them serving falafel for dinner and nearly freaked.  Other than that, there is nothing overly unique about this classic Las Vegas style buffet.\n\nThere are two main lines that serve essentially the same things on each side.  The decor is consistent with the rest of the Luxor with sand colors all over the place and walls made of wannabe stone.  The only thing they're really missing is bits of sand and dust falling from the ceiling.  I didn't feel like a pharaoh based on the way the staff had treated me.  The prices were king-like, for a mere $25 I could enjoy my din din.  Breakfast is the better deal here for sure as its a little less than $15.\n\nThe food is good surprisingly and incredible abundant but hardly a step up from your average buffet at any of the casinos.  Its very bizarre to hang out in the pizza section where its tossed in front of you while walking around the feasts of Egypt.  That feast is usually limited to Mexican, Italian, and general American cuisine.  There is nothing that is exotic enough to mention, other than the fact their hash browns are fabulous during breakfast time.  Then again, so is the Pyramid Cafe upstairs."

I was excited to try Aladdin's based on the positive reviews, but my experience was far from enjoyable. The service was lackluster at best. Our waitress seemed disinterested in taking our order and didn't even crack a smile. She didn't seem to know the menu and was clearly just going through the motions. I attempted to make a joke to lighten the mood, but she gave me a blank stare in return.

The food itself was just okay. I tried the hummus chicken plate, which was supposed to be a healthier option, but it ended up being quite bland. The pita was dry and the chicken was overcooked. The highlight of the meal was the fresh juices, but even those couldn't save the overall experience.

To top it off, on our way out we were greeted with judgmental stares from the hostesses at the front. It was extremely uncomfortable and made me feel unwelcome. I will not be returning to this restaurant.

If you're looking for a place with better service and food, I suggest checking out one of the other options in the area. N9NE Steakhouse at Palms, Mortons off Flamingo Road, or Gordon Ramsays in Paris Hotel/Casino are all great options. Don't waste your time and money at Aladdin's. They clearly don't value their customers."
302,"Worst car wash that I have ever had.  The windows where covered with smears.  Looks like they took a dirty rag to wipe them down.  I had to ask several time to have the bugs wiped off my bumper, the drips wiped off the sides of the car and the rear bumper to be wiped down.  The final straw was when I got home and realized that they hadn't even vacuumed the car at ALL!\nAll this for $13.  I had gone here for years....I will not be returning.\nAfter reading the most recent reviews of this place...I guess I should just be glad that I didn't have anything stolen from my vehicle."

Unfortunately, my recent experience at this USwirl location has left much to be desired. While the decor is attractive and upscale, the noise level was much too high for comfortable conversation, which is a growing issue in new restaurants. I also missed one of my go-to dishes, Singapore Noodles, which I highly suggest they add to their menu. Despite the upscale atmosphere, the food was just okay - nothing extraordinary. The edamame was excellent and the shrimp dumplings were decent, but the chicken satay lacked flavor unless dipped in the peanut sauce. And while the curry had a decent flavor, it was more soupy than I'm used to in Asia. 

I must say, I was disappointed with my mojito. It was simply too bland for my liking, lacking in both mint and liquor taste. On a positive note, the portions were quite generous - something I appreciate in a more upscale restaurant. However, the prices still seemed a bit high for the overall experience. 

Overall, I had an okay experience at this USwirl location. I would suggest they make some improvements, such as adding sound softening, and bring back customer favorites like Singapore Noodles. With a few tweaks, this place could definitely reach its full potential. Until then, I'll opt to drive across town to get my frozen yogurt fix."

After a day of exploring the US National Whitewater Center, my group and I were craving a delicious meal with a beautiful view. That's when we stumbled upon this restaurant overlooking the main activity area. With a stunning view of the sunset and free live entertainment on Thursday nights, we were excited to give it a try. However, our experience here was a bit underwhelming.

We were quickly seated and served, which was a relief after a long day of activities. The beer selection was decent and reasonably priced. We started off with a classic appetizer of fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce, which never fails to disappoint. But that's where the positive notes end for this dining experience.

I opted for the Apple Walnut Chicken Salad, hoping for a refreshing and flavorful meal. Unfortunately, the salad was lackluster and did not live up to my expectations. While the marinated grilled chicken was decent, the spring mix and apples were nothing special. The candied walnuts added a touch of sweetness, but it wasn't enough to save the dish.

On top of that, the service was just okay. While the staff was friendly, they seemed to be rushed and understaffed. This resulted in slow service and overlooked details, such as a missing soap in the restroom dispenser.

Overall, I was disappointed with my dining experience at this restaurant. While the location and view were exceptional, it was not enough to make up for the average food and mediocre service. I might give this place another try in the future, but it definitely won't be at the top of my list."
305,"You know, everyone raves about this place, and I can't see it. It's annoyingly loud, the seats are pretty uncomfortable and the food quality just isn't there. I just finished having lunch with a gf who loves Grand Lux and is in from out of town, so politely agreed to join at Palazzo. I ordered something different from the Asian Nachos which is the only thing that I have had there that I thought was extra good at one time, but the last time I got them thought they had gone downhill, so decided to switch today to the Rachel (sister to a Ruben). The meat was so greasy and bad tasting that I literally had to pull it from the sandwich and eat the slaw and bread alone which too was overly greased and dripping. I stopped eating at about half because I thought it would make my stomach upset if I ate more. Trust me, I don't usually walk away from a Ruben sandwich. With so many great places to eat in Vegas why bother?"

After my disappointing experience at O'Brien Toyota, I decided to do some research before going back. And let's just say, I wish I had taken my car somewhere else sooner.

Don't be fooled by their attempts to manipulate their bad reviews - changing the name of their shop multiple times and constantly rearranging their address. It's clear that they just care about making a quick buck, even if it means cheating their customers.

I've owned both a 2007 and a newer car and somehow, according to O'Brien, they both have the same issue with their water pump. It's almost as if they have a script they follow just to make sure they can overcharge you for unnecessary repairs. It's a total scam and I refuse to fall for it again.

When I was looking to trade up, I couldn't even get a salesperson to pay attention to me. It was like pulling teeth just to get someone to talk to me about a potential purchase. Needless to say, I took my business elsewhere and ended up getting a Jeep instead. And let me tell you, the customer service at the Jeep dealership was a breath of fresh air compared to O'Brien.

Plus, the cherry on top? Oil changes are half the price at the Jeep dealership compared to O'Brien. After 13 years of being loyal to Toyota, I am officially done with their lackluster service at O'Brien. Don't waste your time or money at this dealership - there are plenty of better options out there."

My recent visit to this venue was a mix of highs and lows. The location may be a bit hidden, but for me it's a familiar spot tucked behind my parents' house. Whenever I come back to town, this is one of my go-to places. However, the service can be hit or miss. The bartenders seemed a little standoffish at times, but there were a couple of friendly faces behind the bar. \n
During my last visit, a group of loud and obnoxious individuals seemed to have taken over the place. It was a bit off-putting and definitely took away from the laid-back atmosphere I've come to enjoy. Despite this, I still appreciate this spot for its convenience and ability to serve up some much needed libations. \n
The music selection was a nice mix and definitely added to the ambiance. However, after a long day of driving to get there, the slow and soothing melodies ended up lulling my BF and I into a sleepy state. We didn't get to fully enjoy the concert as we ended up leaving early. But we promised each other that we would come back in 15 years when we're older and don't have to drive as far. Overall, this place may not be my top choice, but it serves its purpose and holds sentimental value for me. "
308,"This place is very cool, but they are armatures! They do NOT know how to make a real cappuccino. It is complete false advertising because the present latte art only on a Latte, which is not how you make a cappuccino. They need to goto Italy and learn what to do. I hate coffee place that cater to the ignorance of America. This place has great potential and is hip, but they need to kick it up a notch. Learn the coffee biz, don't do it half Ass!!"
309,"I couldn't finish my food because it was cold and tasteless.  I've had meals at IHOP that have been better.  I should have walked out before I ate because the decor was terrible, and that should have been the first sign.  Drinking water out of an old plastic cup was also gross.  I had the eggs benedict and the muffin was not fresh and the sauce was not creamy or hot.  I will never go back."

This was my second visit to this restaurant and unfortunately, it was not as great as my first experience. The first time I visited, the food was fantastic! The flavors were on point and everything was cooked perfectly. This time, however, was a completely different story. \n\nI ordered the same dish as I did on my first visit, but when it arrived, I was completely disappointed. The quinoa pasta was clumped together, as if it had been left on the stove for way too long. The broccoli was also in a huge clump and I had to use a knife to separate it. And worst of all, there was no feta cheese in my dish! To top it off, there was so much sauce that the bottom of the container looked like soup. \n\nBut the biggest disappointment was the taste. It was completely off. Instead of tasting like sesame sauce, it tasted more like sesame oil. Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for. \n\nI wanted to love this place again, but unfortunately, this visit left a bad taste in my mouth. I hope that this was just a one-time mishap and that my next visit will be as good as my first. Fingers crossed!"

I've gotten hammered at this place on cheap beer (pbr or lite beer of some kind), seen it both quiet and fucking rowdy as shit.   One night I was there and there were like 4 fights where people were really busting each others heads. That's when it's time for me to bail -- I want no part of getting accidentally shot by some guy I don't know who's just gotten stomped on by 3 other guys I don't know and decides to bust out his fucking 38 and fire a few off into the crowd.

I ordered the special \""Seafood Pealla Plate\"". However, when it came out I began to eat it and I found that I was eating the shell of the mussell.  I told the owner that there was a cracked shell in my plate with pieces throughout the plate. He shrugged his shoudlers and said that \"" You have to be careful with pealla\"".  I was floored with this response.  I explained that shells are not edible and he said \""that was how we make it\"".  He then began to tell me the history of where pealla came from.  I told him to forget the history lesson and I will pay and go.

I mention to the lady that it was gapping she kept saying no I wont notice or it will be okay. Also I kept saying I wanted them thin and natural, they look like really cheap acrylics. Very UNHAPPY! Need to find time to get these soaked off and find a place that can do a proper job."

Overall, I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. On one hand, the decor is stylish and modern, creating a great atmosphere for a nice dinner. The outdoor patio with a fireplace is a nice touch and adds to the overall ambiance. However, my excitement for the food was quickly dampened by the lackluster flavors. The menu was filled with fancy, trendy foodie terms, but the dishes themselves did not live up to the hype. The organic salad had a strong, earthy flavor that I personally found unappealing, while my main course of buttermilk fried chicken was well-cooked but lacking in flavor. My husband's risotto had a strange, off-putting taste that we couldn't quite put our finger on. We gave the restaurant another chance with visiting family, but unfortunately, the flavors were still lacking. It's clear that the chefs have good technique, as the dishes were all well-prepared, but the flavors just didn't hit the mark. I may consider giving it a few more years to see if any improvements are made, but for now, I will be spending my fine dining dollars elsewhere. "

I have to say, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this training center. I had heard great things about it and was excited to try it out, but it fell far short of my expectations. First of all, the class sizes were much larger than advertised. Instead of the promised 5-10 people per class, there were over 20 people crammed into the room. I couldn't even get a proper view of the instructor, let alone personalized attention.

Speaking of the instructor, while I won't name names, it was clear that they were not highly knowledgeable. I consider myself a competitive athlete, yet the exercises were not tailored to my abilities at all. Instead, it seemed like a one-size-fits-all approach, which left me feeling frustrated and unmotivated.

But the biggest disappointment was the price. I was under the impression that I would be getting the benefits of personal training without the high cost, but that was not the case. The fees were exorbitant, and there were even hidden charges for certain equipment and additional classes.

Overall, I was thoroughly unimpressed with this training center. While I understand it just opened, I expected much more from the rave reviews I had heard. Save your money and find a better gym that actually delivers on its promises."

I recently stayed at Stratosphere for a business trip and decided to give their Wi-Fi a try. Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find out that the ""free"" Wi-Fi option only provided a measly 1mb of data. As someone who needs to stay connected for work, this was quite frustrating. I mean, who can get anything done with just 1mb? And if you need more, get ready to dish out an extra $10 per day. 

On a positive note, the room itself was spacious, clean, and modern. I also appreciated the variety of restaurant options available, although I didn't get a chance to try them. The buffet was decent and reasonably priced, perfect for a quick meal. The food court, on the other hand, was lacking in choices.

In terms of amenities, the pool looked inviting but I never got a chance to check it out. The mall and shops, however, were forgettable. Definitely not worth the time. 

Overall, my stay at Stratosphere was satisfactory. But if you need reliable and free Wi-Fi, this might not be the place for you. Other than that, the reasonable prices and convenient parking make it a decent choice for a budget-friendly stay."

I have to admit, I was quite disappointed with my experience at this highly talked about spot. Maybe I should have taken note of who exactly was raving about it - let's just say they have a reputation for eating anything. 

While I can't deny that the food was good, it was nothing extraordinary. As someone who grew up in the big city, I've had my fair share of delicious diners serving up breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night meals. The highlight of my visit was the fresh-squeezed orange juice, which was absolutely perfect. 

But let's talk about the menu. It's small, and it seems like they don't believe in green veggies or fruits. This place is all about carb and fat overload, and the portions are huge. I know some people love this type of food, but for someone like me who doesn't typically eat this way, it was a bit overwhelming. 

I have to admit, I was bamboozled into coming here by a friend who was paying for lunch. Of course, I wanted to be gracious and see what all the hype was about. But boy, was I wrong. After waiting for what felt like an eternity, I finally dug into my meal. And let me tell you, I was instantly regretting it. The heavy, greasy food sucked all the life out of me, and I ended up taking an extended nap later that day. Trust me, you don't want to plan any strenuous activities after eating here. 

So here's my verdict - if you're a fan of this type of food, you'll probably enjoy it. But if you're not used to eating this way, be prepared for a major food coma. And let's just say, next time I'll be choosing my own dining spot."

I recently visited this specialty coffee and breakfast spot for a lunch with a friend. We opted to try out their lunch menu and I have to say, I was impressed! The Mediterranean omelet was huge and definitely worth the $11.75 price tag. In fact, we ended up splitting it because we couldn't finish it all! The flavors were spot on and it was clear that they used high quality ingredients. I also couldn't resist ordering the Latte Especiale, which did not disappoint. It had the perfect balance of espresso and foam. We sat outside on their lively patio, soaking in the Euro feel of the place. The service was excellent as well, with our server being attentive and friendly throughout our meal. The only downside was that our food took a little longer than expected to come out, which we later found out was due to them preparing for a private event. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for its tasty food and charming ambiance, just be aware that the service may be slower during peak times. I haven't tried their breakfast yet, but if it's anything like our lunch experience, I'm sure it's just as good! "

Dear Kevin Sousa,

I have been a fan of your culinary skills for a while now, and I was excited to try your latest creations at your restaurant. Yesterday, my friend and I stopped by and we were both impressed with our food. My friend ordered his go-to chili dog, which he absolutely loved, and I decided to try the duck confit taco. Let me just say, wow! The flavors were out of this world and for only $5, it was a steal.

I have to give you credit, your dishes are always so unique and full of delicious flavors. I am a big fan of your cooking style. Last time I visited, I tried your famous fries and they were perfectly crispy and fresh. I have yet to try the poutine, but if it's anything like the cheese curds on the chili dog, I have no doubt it's amazing. Yay!

However, I do have to point out a small issue. While the flavors were spot on, the portion size of my taco was a bit underwhelming. For $5, I was hoping for a little more food on my plate. But, I understand that quality ingredients can be expensive so I can forgive this slight disappointment.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at your restaurant. Your creativity and skill in the kitchen are evident in every dish. I can't wait to come back and try the poutine, and maybe even splurge on one of your famous cocktails. Keep up the great work!

Sincerely,
A satisfied customer."

My friends and I decided to give America's Taco Shop a try for lunch, but unfortunately we were left feeling disappointed.

It was our first time at this location and we were hoping for a great experience, but the food was underwhelming to say the least. And what's with the flat burrito? It just didn't hit the spot.

Of course, and you run this risk with any outlet place, it's completely hit or miss as far as merchandise.  Sometimes they get the overstock from a good season, sometimes its a bad season.  Last time I went into this mall, I spent a good two and a half hours, entered women's stores ranging from the cheap and trampy (Forever 21) to the classy professional (Ann Taylor), tried on dozens of dresses and tops, and left with a grand total of... a few pairs of leggings.

324,"I am so sad to write a 2 star review of this place...I wanted to like their food so much! But, there were some problems, that we just couldn't ignore.\n\nFirst of all, it was Saturday night, in Charlotte...now, Charlotte is a restaurant town. No where is empty on the weekends, and I don't think anyone stays home on the weekends for dinner!!! This place was completely empty. We were the only customers the entire time we were there. This is a huge red flag, but when we were done with dinner, we understood.\n\nWe got the variety plate appetizer. The falafel was nice. Hummus was good. Babaghannouj was pretty good. Their stuffed grape leaves were the best thing we had the entire meal.\n\nHubby and myself both ordered tagine, I got lamb and he got the fish. The fish was fishy...I like fish, but this just wasn't exactly right, and I can't put my finger on where it went wrong. The lamb was tender but dry...I know that sounds strange too!!! But, it was pull apart tender, but there was no moisture, no succulence...it was ok.\n\nOur other issue is that we wanted \""authentic\"" Moroccan food...If you have ever read any of my other reviews...we really really like different foods.\n\nBut, when we were ordering the waitress told us that \""authentic\"" came with french fries, and the \""american\"" style came with rice... This just doesn't seem right to me. But, the rice was nicely cooked and flavored.\n\nSometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer from trying to stay too true to their roots, and fall short because the ingredients are lacking here in the states.\n\nBut, sometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer by trying to americanize their menu...and going way too far.\n\nI think this is the problem with Casablanca. With zero customers on a Saturday night, they need to re-think their approach to Moroccan food in Charlotte."
325," The park's historical significance and beautiful location make it a must-see when visiting Pittsburgh.

Michael and I decided to visit Point State Park during our trip to Pittsburgh. The park holds 36 acres of rich history, once home to forts and major battlefields during the French & Indian War and American Revolution. It's fascinating to learn about its past and see how it has transformed over the years.\n\nNot only is the park filled with history, but it also boasts beautiful views of the city. We were impressed with the efforts to preserve the Fort Pitt blockhouse, believed to be the oldest building in Western Pennsylvania. It was purchased and maintained by the Daughters of the American Revolution, and it was open for the public to explore.\n\nWhile the park is a great spot for a leisurely stroll or a scenic picnic, we also enjoyed learning about its significance in Pittsburgh's development. It's hard to imagine that this picturesque park was once occupied by warehouses and railroad yards. The transformation of the area is truly impressive.\n\nHowever, we were a bit disappointed with the limited food options at the park. We were hoping to grab a quick bite to eat, but unfortunately, there were only a few food trucks scattered around. It would have been more convenient to have more options within the park.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our visit to Point State Park and would recommend it to anyone looking to learn about Pittsburgh's history and enjoy some beautiful views. But if you're planning on spending a full day here, make sure to pack some snacks or plan for a meal outside of the park."

I finally made it out to Fatburger with my son, excited to try out the famous burger joint mentioned in Ice T's ""it was a good day"" song. However, our experience was anything but good. Despite being the only ones in the lobby, we waited for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. And once we were finally seated, it took another 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive. The waitress, who was friendly at first, pushed us to order the kids meal for my son, despite my wanting to try something different. And unfortunately, her recommendation was a complete disappointment. The burger was greasy and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. And the fries were soggy and undercooked. As a first-timer at Fatburger, I was hoping for a better experience, but the lack of service and gross food left me with no choice but to leave no tip. Admittedly, the place has a ""real LA fast food joint"" feel and the food may be filling, but it's not worth the calories or the money. I won't be returning anytime soon."

I was really looking forward to dining at this restaurant, as I had heard great things about it from friends and online reviews. Unfortunately, it ended up being a major disappointment. From the moment we were seated, it was one issue after another. My drink arrived with a bug and a piece of plastic in it. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and ordered a different drink, only to have the same problem. I couldn't believe that the bartender didn't catch these issues before serving the drinks. To make matters worse, there was a swarm of gnats flying around near our table. It was incredibly off-putting and made me lose my appetite. \nNot only did the overall experience leave much to be desired, but so did the food. The salad was a sad excuse for a salad, with only iceberg lettuce and barely any dressing. The pastas were bland and tasteless, and the prices did not match the quality of the food. The only saving grace was the spumoni dessert. \nNeedless to say, I was incredibly uncomfortable and unimpressed during my time at this restaurant. I never want to set foot in here again and have vetoed the idea every time my boyfriend suggests trying it again. We have had much better experiences at other Italian restaurants like RigaTony's and Oregano's. Don't waste your time or money here, trust me and many other reviewers."
328,"Not quite the A-List crowd like the one in NYC, but it did the job.\n\nNice looking venue (but what venue ISN'T nice looking in Vegas?), though not quite as impressive as TAO (that room is just incredible looking, but with a shitty crowd.)\n\nThe girls were very drunk and very friendly, though I must admit not so to every guy. LOL\n\nI couldnt tell you anything about the restaurant, but the drink prices were quite reasonable compared to Manhattan."

From the moment we walked in, we could tell this restaurant prided itself on offering a healthier spin on classic dishes. The menu boasted organic ingredients and fresh options, so we were excited to try it out. However, after sampling multiple dishes, our taste buds were left unimpressed. The burgers lacked flavor and the chicken was dry. The hummus and spinach dip were decent, but still on the bland side. Even the gyro, a dish usually bursting with flavor, fell flat. Maybe it was just an off day, but we were disappointed that the food didn't live up to our expectations. We appreciated the healthy options, but flavor should never be sacrificed for health. Perhaps with some more seasoning and spices, this place could reach its full potential. Overall, it was an average dining experience, not bad but not impressive either. We might give it another chance, but for now, we'll stick to other restaurants for more flavorful meals."
330,"I was a bit iffy about coming to a place in the notorious China Town Mall when our business associates invited us here for dinner.  We even went back a second time for a second attempt on our own.  They are located in middle of the indoor shopping complex within the strip mall.  \n\nFor cold starters, we tried Tofu Beef & Cucumber and Happy Couple, both were quite bland and a bit on the sweet side. We had an odd soup with fish ball in it, which is almost like a bowl of noodle soup without the noodle, and the soup was quite salty.\n\nThe Chicken Pot was a bit boney on the sweet side, and flavor was not all there either.  Beef Noodles was ok.  I avoided the Egg Plant.  The Taro Short Ribs was an interesting dish, but the combined flavor was just very odd even for a Chinese dish.  Chili Broth Beef & Fish was just a big mess, I could not find the star of the dish.\n\nPeach Smoothie was the best part of the meal, as it was a decent quality drink.\n\nDa Sheng was not up to par when compared with other Chinese restaurant in the area, however, they do excel in their drinks.  Perhaps they should just focus on that instead...  Service was just \""meh\"".  I suppose the low price was able to justify the poorly made food."

My experience with Bo and his crew was extremely disappointing. I hired them last minute to help me move and was excited to see that they were available in the evening, unlike other movers I had contacted. However, their availability and affordability were the only positive aspects of the service. The actual move was a disaster. They were not careful with my belongings and ended up damaging some of my furniture. They were also incredibly slow and unorganized, making the process much longer than expected. Despite their friendly demeanor, I could tell that they weren't putting in their best effort. To make matters worse, they were completely unaccommodating to my specific moving needs, making the whole experience even more frustrating. I definitely will not be using their services again and would not recommend them to anyone. "
332,"

I had high hopes for this restaurant after hearing such rave reviews from my friends. However, my recent experience here was a complete disappointment. While the food was decent, the service was atrocious. Our waiter seemed to be more interested in chatting with his coworkers than attending to our table. It took forever to get our orders taken and our drinks were never refilled. When our food finally arrived, it was lukewarm and lacking the delicious flavors promised on the menu. And don't even get me started on the lengthy wait for the check. It's a shame that such great food is paired with such subpar service.

I even tried requesting to speak with a manager, but they were nowhere to be found. It's clear that the staff here has not been properly trained in customer service. I will definitely be taking my business and my taste buds to a different location next time I get a craving for some tasty seafood. Don't waste your time or money at this establishment, there are much better options out there."

I was really hoping for a great lunch experience at this fancy restaurant, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. The menu was a bit too cheesy for my taste, with everything having some cutesy name that was a bit off-putting. Plus, as a vegetarian, my options were quite limited. I settled on the veggie sandwich, which came on unbilled rye bread - not my favorite. And to make matters worse, my husband's burger came with a surprise breaded bacon. Who does that? But I have to admit, the chips that came with the sandwich were surprisingly delicious. In fact, they were the best part of my entire meal. And that's saying something. 

To top it all off, my chair was stained with red wine, which makes me wonder about the cleanliness of this place. Although I should have noticed the stain before sitting down, it just adds to my overall disappointment. And to make matters worse, the server was all about the hard upsell. I understand that they want to make a profit, but it just came across as pushy and insincere. 

Honestly, I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant. I was hoping for a memorable dining experience, but all I got was a mediocre lunch and a stained chair. The only saving grace was that we got to use a gift card, so at least we didn't waste our own hard-earned money. Perhaps it's for the best that we don't go back. "

I recently had a similar experience to the one described above at this salon. I was excited to try it out after hearing great things from friends and seeing their amazing DealChicken special. The salon is beautiful and the staff was friendly when I arrived. They offered me a mimosa and some snacks, which was a nice touch. However, things started to go downhill from there. 

The hair services were fine, but when it came to my makeup, I was disappointed. I had told the stylist I was open to something bolder for a special event, but the end result was more Kardashian than I had anticipated. It was a bit too much for my taste, but I decided to give it a chance and wear it to the party. 

Overall, the services provided were as advertised and I can't fault the salon for that. However, I was left feeling underwhelmed and not as satisfied as I had hoped. Despite the excellent DealChicken deal, I don't think I would make the trek out to this salon again. While I appreciate the effort and hospitality of the staff, the end result was just ""A-OK"" for me. Perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference, but I don't see myself becoming a regular customer here. "
335,"I grew up eating in little hole in the wall chinese restaurants and I really wanted to like New Garden.  I had driven past the place many times and thought it was abandoned but after looking on Google and seeing some good reviews on Yelp I decided to give the place a try.\n\nThe interior matches the exterior,  There were food stains on the wall next to the both I was eating in.  The server laid out our place setting by handling the eating surface of every utensil she put down.  One of the bowls they brought us was dirty too.  \n\nThe server never came around to see if we needed anything else but she did decide to drop off more napkins right as we were finishing our meal.  The food isn't bad the prices don't match the service and the questionable cleanliness will make it enough for me to never come back."
336,"I really only come here for the turkey club and pesto turkey sandwiches at lunchtime, and this time I got the latter. I expected to pay maybe $7.50 for it, as there are no prices on the website or mobile app...It ended up being over 10. It came with fries. \n\nFor that price, I almost expected it to be the best turkey sandwich I ever had, and it was way short of that. I could barely taste the pesto and the whole thing needed salt! I ordered an overpriced mimosa, which the only redeeming quality to this visit was that they leave the remnants of the little champagne bottle at your table for you finish off.\nService was slow, but it did seem unusually busy for a weekday at 11:30a. My drink and food came out fast, but by the time i needed to pay and get out of there, my waitress was nowhere to be seen. \n\nI will be looking for a new place to get a turkey sandwich,lol My decision is based on first price, then service. If it had been cheap, I wouldn't have cared about the service, and if it had fantastic service, the price wouldn't have bothered me as bad. \n\nThis was my \""last straw\"" visit to this place. My husband doesn't like it,which is why i went alone. I was hoping it would impress me as it had in the past, but it was ultimately a fail. Will not be back."

When I arrived at this French restaurant, it was packed with people on a Friday night. I could barely even move around! I only had time for a glass of wine before heading out, which cost me a whopping $8. But from what I've heard, the food here is supposed to be amazing, so I'm willing to reserve judgment until I actually try it. My friends have raved about their meals here, so I'm hoping my experience will be just as good."
338,"I actually like this place and would like to give it a higher rating, but I felt like there should be a more inexpensive lunch special.  There is harsh competition out there for lunch.  My pad thai was pretty good, but I didn't really feel like there was any spice to it at all.  I asked for medium. I guess next time I will ask for hot.  The prawns were a decent size.  I do plan on trying them again, for dinner maybe."
339,"I went for their lunch special, but they ran out of soup. They also ran out of eggrolls. They also ran out of curry. It took forty-five minutes for them to make new curry. \n\nThe extra star is for the service. Our waitress was very nice and apologetic about things which she couldn't control. \n\nAfter I ate, I also ran out. I'm not running back in either."
340,"We went on Father's Day-understaffed, and inexperienced servers, not a good use of space with the tables( could have had many more) and the food, well, we wondered why the table next to us left most of theirs.  After being served the food we understood why-muffins look great but were dry, the omelet and potatoes tasted like the canned greasethey were fried in (not a hit for our intestines either if you know what I mean, none of us felt that hot an hour later)  and even the salad dressing was gross.  We left ours too after spending 50 bux, sorry, this place was a miss."
341,"Ok I went out tonight to celebrate a friend's accomplishments and I mean to tell you the restaurant  decor was very tasteful BUT the general ambience was some BOO -JET-O!

What?        The worst part was when I inquired about the tiny table that should have only seated 6 and they crammed 9 of us in it. The hostess said\"" you had one person added to your party so we tried to accommodate you, since they joined at the last minute.\"" I have been to The Inn of Little Washington, Sequoia's, Tavern on the Glen, Butter and have NEVER been told that.

342,"We wandered over the Alley Cat Saturday night for a drink after attempting three other bars in uptown that had too long of a wait to get in. I was impressed! They had a great live cover band, who in particularly did Rage Against the Machine and the White Stripes pretty well. I liked how spacious this place is. You can come here and, even though it is packed, make your way to the bar and get a beer pretty easily with others who just want to have a good time, not pretentious people who are over dressed and under friendly. The DJ in between the sets did a pretty good job, but once he got on a killer 80's kick and we heard \""That Girl is Poison\"" I had just about had enough. It's good to throw the 80's in, don't get me wrong, but you have to know when to stop, and this guy didn't. Regardless, I would totally go back here."

Why would you even bring that out to me? \n\nThe 6oz filet was so thin and had no texture to it at all. I eat filet mignon ALOT, and in the price point that Outback is selling it for, it is outrageous that it tasted like it did. I had to ask for A1!!! IF A CUSTOMER HAS TO USE A1 to choke down a $20 steak in your restaurant, SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ARRESTED!!!  \n\nThe waiter was pleasant. The sweet potato was good, even without brown sugar.  But I can make a sweet potato at home for 1.00. \n\nI didn't like this visit at all, and for me to give it another shot, it would have to be FREE!  \n\nI would rather go Mastro's and spend an extra $15 for an 8oz filet and feel like I died and went to heaven.

After hearing rave reviews about Village Seafood Buffet from my friends, I figured it was time to give this place a try. Sadly, my experience did not live up to the hype. While the staff seemed friendly and welcoming, it was clear that they were struggling to keep up with the high demand. Our server was clearly overwhelmed with multiple tables and it took quite a while for her to take our initial drink order.

As for the food, the appetizers were the only saving grace, and even then it was nothing to write home about. The oyster was gritty with sand, making it nearly inedible, and the raw fish was not as fresh as I had hoped. The crab legs were decent, but nothing special. Overall, it was a letdown for a seafood lover like myself.

But the real kicker was when I bit into my pasta dish and felt something hard. To my horror, it was a large piece of bone! Not only was this a safety hazard, but it also ruined the entire meal for me and my friends. Needless to say, we did not bother taking any leftovers home with us.

In terms of price, it's not terrible but for the quality of food, it definitely wasn't worth it. I suggest trying out other seafood restaurants in the area with better options and fresher seafood. Trust me, there are much better places to spend your money.

Overall, I left feeling extremely disappointed and underwhelmed by my experience at Village Seafood Buffet. Do yourself a favor and opt for a different seafood spot in town. After this experience, I'm downgrading my initial rating of 2 stars to 1. This place just doesn't cut it."
347,"Ugh this place is annoying.\n\n- too many stairs\n- bouncers are incredibly rude\n- dance floor is closed off ~11pm because it gets too crowded\n- when on the dance floor, I'm afraid to leave the dance floor (for bathroom or drink) because I'm worried I won't be able to come back\n- too crowded\n- outdoor area is too cold during the winter\n- headlining DJ doesn't come out until 1-1:30am\n- hiphop floor stinks"

Upon arriving at the restaurant, I had high expectations for my meal. I had heard great things about the downtown location and was excited to try the one in my area. However, my experience at Carolina's turned out to be a huge disappointment.

I ordered the strawberry cream cheese french toast, expecting a delicious and indulgent breakfast. However, my hopes were quickly shattered when I took a bite and discovered that the toast was completely soggy. The excessive amount of cream cheese, whip cream, and artificial strawberry sauce made the toast almost inedible. It was so sweet that there was no need for syrup, and I couldn't even taste the actual french toast.

To make matters worse, the cashier/hostess Caresia seemed to be having a bad day. She was unfriendly and not personable at all. It was clear that she didn't care about providing good service to her customers. On top of that, the food was not up to par.

The only positive aspect of my experience was the hospitality of the waitresses. They were friendly and attentive, which was a small consolation for the mediocre food and subpar service.

Overall, I would not recommend wasting your time and money at Carolina's. The food was not good and the service was lacking. If you're in the mood for good French toast, I suggest going to a different restaurant. "
349,"It is nice and clean with cute dog pictures all around.  I enjoy the open layout\nOn my first visit, I really enjoyed the fajita meat, the tortillas were a bit dry and oldy tasting but oh my gosh, the PRETZEL was AMAZING. If they could make every sandwich or slider on a pretzel roll like that, it would be HEAVEN.   I was told fish tacos were also excellent.  On the second visit the pork was dry and chewy and the beer brewed sauce to go on it was non-existent.  The sandwich got lost in deep fried onion strings and I had to ask for the beer BBQ sauce which was then brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. The cheese dip was standard Velveeta like process cheese, nothing special.  Chips slightly staley tasting.  The wings were not very good due to soggy skins, too little sauce, hardly any taste and kind of chewy and too lightly flavored; just not right.  \n\nThe specialty drink I ordered was good at a price of $7.50 and not very big at all.  They brought it in a Martini glass and it was definitely not a martini drink.  It should have been alot larger for the price.  The beer list is not as extensive as Mellow Mushroom across the street.  The service was great.  The music was odd but they changed it after I asked. Something young people without money might listen to.   The lighting can be interesting at certain tables.  First visit was a 5 star but this second visit was nothing special at all.  For my 2 visits, this averages to an A-OK."

The Good: While dining at this restaurant, we were consistently impressed by the quality and taste of the food. The bread was fresh, the fish dishes were top-notch, and the unique flavors really stood out. The presentation of each dish was also very well done, making for a visually pleasing meal.

The Bad: Unfortunately, we were not as pleased with the setup of the restaurant. Despite making a reservation for a table, we were seated at a bar-like table, which made it difficult for one of us to join in on the conversation. It would have been much more enjoyable to sit at a regular table and be able to talk face to face with our whole group.

The Ugly: Now, let's talk about the prices. The tapas-style of this restaurant means that you have to order multiple dishes per person in order to feel satisfied. However, each dish is priced as if it were a regular-sized entree at a different restaurant. Our table of three ordered nine dishes, a couple of glasses of wine each, and a couple of shared desserts. The final bill came out to be around $100 per person, which is quite steep for tapas dishes.

In conclusion, while we did have a good experience overall, the inflated prices left a sour taste in our mouths. With so many other great restaurants in the area, we will most likely not be returning to this one."

I came here with a group of friends for my girl's bachelorette party and let me tell you, this place was a disappointment. The ambience and decor were nice, but that's about where the positives end. We were already pretty tipsy when we stumbled in around 2 or 3 a.m., so we weren't looking for any more drinks. We were mainly there for the music and convenience - since we were staying at The Venetian, this was the closest option. However, even though it won by default, we still ended up regretting our decision.

The buddhist projections on the walls and the monk art were cool, but it honestly felt like they were compensating for something. Maybe if they had focused more on their menu and service, we would've had a better experience. Speaking of which, the staff was not helpful at all. When we asked about the various dishes, they were dismissive and didn't seem to care about explaining anything to us. It's a shame because we were excited to try the unique menu items, but we left disappointed and hungry.

One major letdown was the supposedly ""overcooked"" pork chop. My friend ended up with what looked like a piece of jerky on her plate. And my main course, the crispy chicken, was nothing more than bland chicken fingers with salty potatoes and chorizo on the side. Can you say ""rip-off""? And don't even get me started on the cheese platter - what a joke. $16 for a few measly pieces of basic cheese? I could've gone to the grocery store and made my own for a fraction of the price.

Overall, we were severely underwhelmed with our experience at this place. Maybe it's because we went in late at night, but it seems like they prioritize drunk patrons over actually serving quality food. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a satisfying dining experience. Save your money and head to a different tapas spot. Trust me, it'll be worth it."
352,"You know, sometimes you just forget where you bought that pair of slacks that fits so good.

353,"I agree with Brett, McKirdys is a little bit of a let down (and Ruth Chris is the business)\n\nI'm not much of a steak expert, but how you cook it doesn't matter, it's the quality of the meat. I'm not saying this stuff is low grade or anything, it's good. But it does't merit the acclaim that the waiters were quick to give it. The meat looked a little skinny, definitely not what I was expecting.\n\nDesert was excellent though. So give this place a try if you're not expecting much."

Throughout my trip to Las Vegas in February, I was blown away by the amazing acrobat dancers at this venue. The tricks they performed were impressive and truly added to the overall ambiance of the place. However, as with most things in Vegas, it does come at a cost. The drinks were a bit watered down and definitely not worth the steep prices. Despite this, I still recommend giving this place a try if you want to fully immerse yourself in the Vegas experience.

Be warned though, be prepared to wait in line before getting in. Our group arrived early to avoid the crowds, and we were glad we did because the line was already pretty long. It seems like the popularity of this place has caused some issues with crowd control. When I visited, there was only one cashier working and the line took forever to move. It would greatly benefit this place to have more cashiers on hand to speed up service and keep the line moving. Otherwise, you'll have no choice but to wait and frustration may start to set in.

Overall, while I did have a good time here, the wait time and expensive drinks did put a bit of a damper on the experience. If you choose to visit, just keep in mind that you may have to deal with some obstacles along the way. But if you're willing to overlook these inconveniences, then you'll enjoy the lively atmosphere and talented performers of this Vegas hotspot."

The moving process can be a stressful and exhausting experience, but thanks to Easy Movers, my move was made a bit smoother. The team showed up on time and worked diligently to get all of my belongings loaded onto the truck. However, I was a bit disappointed with the estimated time they gave me, as it ended up going over due to some large and heavy pieces I had. Despite this, they did not stop until every last item was safely loaded and secured. I was impressed by their constant pace and dedication to the job. I would highly recommend Easy Movers to anyone in need of a moving company. Their hard work and efficiency definitely made my move easier."

What a disappointing experience. As a disabled veteran, all I wanted was a peaceful dinner at Blanco. Little did I know that purchasing food from their window would not be enough to secure a seat at one of their 19 empty tables. According to the manager, only those who purchase additional food and drinks from the bar are worthy of dining at their tables. As if dealing with chronic pain isn't enough, I was met with discrimination and hostility. Despite the kind words from the staff, it's clear that their actions speak louder. STAY AWAY from this unfriendly and non-inclusive establishment. I hope a surprise inspection from the Health Department will teach them a lesson about valuing all of their customers, not just those who meet their arbitrary standards."
357,"We should have known not to go to Margaritaville when all the other restaurants in Westgate had long waits and we walked right in and had our choice of tables. We should have known to leave when told they do not offer happy hour on game days. \n\nWe ordered house margaritas on the rocks, which were fine. A pretty standard house margarita. They were $7.50 each. \n\nWe ordered Crab, Shrimp and Mushroom Dip, which was $12.50 roughly. It is a decent sized serving, but size doesn't matter because you won't eat more than two bites.  It has the look and consistency of a tuna melt, complete with melted cheddar on top. It does not taste like any of the stated ingredients, but more how what I imagine cat food would taste. It comes with Texas toast, the variety you would find in the frozen section of the supermarket for $3 for a family size box. We sent it back. \n\nWe also had wings with the Jamaican jerk sauce. They were mediocre at best. More edible than the cat food, but not worth ordering again. They were around $11 for 8 or so wings. \n\nService was poor, which is surprising considering how empty it was compared to all neighboring restaurants. \n\nWe left hungry and found the melted cheese that comes with pretzels and nachos at the game far better than anything at Margaritaville, if that says anything. \n\nI will never go back."

We sat down and must of sat there for a good 15 minutes, which in my book is a little excessive for someone not to swing by and say be with you in a \""sec.\""  We finally had a waitress swing by and ask for drinks, by that time I was already annoyed and my wife did most of the drink ordering.

We finally ordered and when the food came it was completely wrong.  Guess what the waitress didn't bring the food, which is OK because I don't think they do that anyway.  The waitress was gone again.  I actually got up from the table to grab a person to ask them to find her.  The guy I asked helped me out and took the food back.  Then another guy came to the table.  This is when I got really mad.  The worst thing a restaurant can do is send the manager to the table in my opinion.  why can't the waitress come by an tell me anything.  He asked if we could describe the waitress.  Then he said the next few words that just make me an angry person.  He said, \""the food is on us!\""  I hate that, because I don't mind paying for food, I just want service! Well off my soap box now on the service portion.

I stopped by this JCPenney location for a quick shopping trip, but boy was I in for a surprise. As soon as I walked in, I was thrown off by the store's new design. It felt more like an Apple Store than a traditional department store. I mean, I appreciate innovation, but it just didn't fit with JCPenney's brand. And it turns out, it was all thanks to a new CEO who used to work for Apple. I guess he wanted to attract a younger crowd, but let's be real, most iPhone shoppers aren't going to shop at JCPenney. 

But that's not the only thing that was off-putting. The layout of the store was just bizarre. Instead of having separate departments for men and women, everything was just thrown together. I couldn't find anything I was looking for. And don't even get me started on the ""stores within a store"" concept. It felt like a Black Lion department store, except it wasn't. And after all the hype about ""one price"" shopping, I still had to keep my eye out for coupons and sales. I mean, what's the point? 

And let's talk about the customer service (or lack thereof). I couldn't even get a table for one at lunchtime because they were having ""staffing problems"". Come on, JCPenney, get it together. And the quality of the food? Overpriced and inconsistent. I'd rather go to the PF Changs in Asheville, which is saying something because that place isn't exactly top-notch either. 

Overall, I'd say I was pretty disappointed with my experience. As someone who has shopped at JCPenney for years, this new concept is just not doing it for me. It's not the JCPenney I know and love. Maybe it's just not for me. But hey, if you're a grandma or a grandma's grandma, you might find it more appealing."

The menu at this restaurant is a bit limited, but what they do offer is delicious and bursting with flavor. The chicken strips and crinkle fries are definitely the standout items on the menu, although I have heard rumors about a secret dipping sauce that adds the perfect touch to any dish. The color theme of the food here is a beautiful ochre, adding to the unique and trendy atmosphere of the place. But what really sets this restaurant apart is the amazing happy hour specials. It seems like they are always running specials, making it a great place to grab a bite and unwind after a long day. My personal favorites are the Kawaii roll, spicy crunchy yellow tail, spicy California roll, ninja roll, and the hamachi sushi. But don't limit yourself to just these options, their menu is extensive and full of delicious surprises. Another standout aspect of this restaurant is the amazing staff, particularly the hostess Kelley. She always goes above and beyond to make every customer feel welcome and taken care of. I remember one time she even brought anime-style stickers for a young niece who was unsure about trying sushi. Not only did it make the food experience more fun and exciting, but it also left a lasting positive impression on the young girl. This restaurant is truly one-of-a-kind and should not be missed. "

If you're in the mood for some mouthwatering seafood, this is the place to be. My friend and I had reservations at 8:30 and were seated immediately in a cozy booth by the beautiful fountains. The ambiance was perfect for a Friday night dinner. We started off with some delicious drinks, I highly recommend the pear martini - it was bursting with fruity flavor without being too sweet. \n\nThe bread course was also impressive, with a variety of breads including a salty and cheesy flatbread and a sweet roll. The only downside for me was the olive tapanades, but that's just my personal preference as I'm not a big fan of olives. \n\nAs for the entrees, I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi and it did not disappoint. The crispy crust on top of the perfectly cooked fish was a match made in seafood heaven. The bed of lime and cilantro basmati rice, ginger bok choy, and miso butter sauce added a burst of fresh flavors to the dish. I couldn't get enough. My friend's Chilean Sea Bass was even better - the risotto with wild mushrooms, sauteed baby spinach, and savory port wine beurre rouge was a flavor explosion in every bite. \n\nTo top it all off, our server was attentive and friendly throughout the entire meal, making sure we had everything we needed. The only reason I'm not giving this place a higher rating is because the olive tapanades and a slightly high price point held me back. But overall, it was a fantastic dining experience with amazing food, great service, and a beautiful atmosphere. Definitely give it a try!"
363,"Weirdly there is no yelp for the Verona one. So I am putting it here.  But I wish I had read these. \n\nI didn't realize until I read other reviews that they include a shampoo with your hair cut. My hair cut last about 10 minutes.  I have hair that is the same length, all I wanted was it cut so that I could still put it up to sleep. I specially mentioned this to her twice.  I wish I could include a picture of how short it actually is. Good luck hearing from someone if you want to talk to someone about not liking your cut.  \n\nMy advice pay a few dollars more and find a place that will take responsibility when they screw up."

The first thing that stands out at Hash House is the size of the portions - they are truly gargantuan! But as they say, bigger doesn't always mean better. While I've had some delicious meals here, there are certainly some menu items that just don't stand out. On top of that, the portions are just too big for my liking and the rest of my family's. I am usually all for leftovers, but here it just feels like overkill. The service is good though, the waiters are always friendly and attentive. However, the real downside to Hash House is the inconsistency of the food quality. While it can be a hit or miss, I always find myself coming back for more. But with so many other restaurants to choose from, it's hard to justify the high prices here. If only they could find a way to balance the portion size with the price tag, Hash House could truly be a top contender in the Vegas food scene. Until then, it remains just an okay spot for me."
365,"I went on a Thursday. It was $10 for ladies to get in, so I found that very reasonable. On Fridays it's $20 for ladies. It wasn't very packed on Thursday, which I enjoyed. I looove that they have salt water pools, and no kids allowed of course 21+. The DJ was alright, played a lot of house at first, then some hip hop. It was pretty loud, and you have to shout a little to talk to eachother, which is fine with me. \n\nI ordered a bloody mary and a fiji water at the bar, it was about $25. That bloody mary was soooo damn tasty, I wasn't even mad about the price. The bartender was also very friendly. I believe his name was Alex, although I could be mistaken. But he was great, I really appreciated the excellent service. I cannot stand when you go to a place and employees have the nerve to act stuck up when I'm in there spending money. \n\nWhich brings me to those GD raunchy ass towel boys (aka security). Jeezus folks, super cop status, seriously? They're like pumped up d-bags who want to police everyone for no good reason. Did I mention it took almost 20 minutes to get into the place?! I only brought myself, but some people had bags of stuff. They searched eeeeverything!! \n\nThey made everyone dump out all their liquids, even contact lense fluid and hand sanitizer! They said it could be drugs, (GHB) what is this the 90's? I found it hilarious. The place wasn't even busy. My best friend was not impressed and completely hated the place before we even got inside. We didn't stay long. They lose two stars from me for the douchey security guards, and long wait.  \n\nOther than that it's a pretty cool place. But the service was horrible. If it wasn't for the super sweet bartender, good drink, and one friendly bouncer, I'd have had to start some shit up in that MF!"
366,"I've lived in some pretty cruddy places before but I think this one defiantly takes the gold medal for shady offices, renters, and staff.  It looks okay during the daytime and it even takes pitbulls which is why we signed the lease. The apartment they show you looks nothing like the one you re going to live in despite them charging you an arm and a leg when you move out. The walls are usually cracked (it looked like someone punched a hole into our bathroom wall) and the kitchen is older than I am. The office staff seem genuinely uncaring and can boarder on being condescending and snide. The pool isn't cleaned often and the grounds are a mess. I lived in Solara in Tempe next to crackheads before and I can honestly say I felt safer there than I did at Coronado. The staff tells you they do background checks and blah blah blah but with police roaming the grounds every night and domestic issues happening weekly I don't believe that for a minute. Just know other apartments take pitbulls and other big breeds and you dont need to put up with this place."

I used to be a loyal customer of this place, back when Jimmy was the owner. I would come here at least once a week and never had a bad experience. The pizza was unbeatable, the service was top-notch, and I truly enjoyed supporting this local business.

But now, with the new ownership, everything has gone downhill. The service is atrocious - the staff is rude, inconsiderate, and couldn't care less about their customers. It's almost as if they want to drive people away with their terrible attitude. And don't even get me started on the food. It used to be the highlight of my week, but now it's practically inedible.

In fact, my last visit here was so bad that I couldn't even finish the meal. I was so disgusted with the rude treatment from the staff and the poor quality of the food that I walked out in the middle of my meal. And let me tell you, I never thought I would see the day when I would be writing a negative review for a place that I once loved.

But the truth is, I will never give them my business again. There are plenty of other restaurants out there that serve delicious food and treat their customers with respect. So take my advice and stay far, far away from this place. It used to be a legend in the community, but now it's nothing but a disappointment. Save yourself the trouble and find a better place to eat. Trust me, you won't regret it."

After a long day of running errands, I was looking forward to a quick and easy meal at my favorite chicken finger spot. But my excitement quickly turned to disappointment as soon as I took a bite of my chicken fingers. They were completely lacking in flavor, almost as if they had forgotten to season them altogether. And don't even get me started on the fries - they were nothing more than basic frozen fries that you could buy at any supermarket.

But what really grinds my gears is the lack of sauce options. I mean, come on, only two sauces to choose from? And don't even bother asking for ranch or BBQ because they don't even offer it. And if you do want additional sauces, get ready to pay extra for them. What kind of chicken finger restaurant doesn't have ranch or BBQ sauce? It's absolutely mind-boggling and makes me question their entire menu.

I was also disappointed to see that they charge extra for their supremely mediocre ""special sauce."" Why would anyone pay for that when they can just get the equally unappetizing honey mustard? And on top of all that, they had the audacity to not include hot sauce as an option. How can a ""chicken finger"" franchise not have hot sauce? It's a staple condiment in any respectable fast food establishment.

In short, this place has been a huge letdown. Between the flavorless chicken fingers, basic fries, and lack of sauce options, I'd say it's best to avoid this place altogether. Save yourself the time, money, and potential indigestion and go somewhere else for your chicken finger fix. "
369,"Ok, so I think 2 stars is harsh, but I'm rating this compared to other Vegas clubs, as I am a local and have been to almost all of them.\n\nWe came here on a Thursday.  We had a table and got right in, but there was no line so I doubt we would have had trouble.  \n\nBut inside, the bouncers were RIDICULOUS.  We were NOT behaving badly, but they kept scolding us like it was a middle school dance.  Girls could barely dance with guys, one of my friends started to grind a little bit on a guy friend sitting in the booth and she almost got thrown out.  It's Vegas - relax!\n\nAnd I agree with previous reviewers about the music - house to top 40 and even some pretty old hip hop - not up to par for a Vegas club, sorry. Go to Tryst or Marquee if you're looking for a legit Vegas club experience, and if you're a local, you'll probably have a better time at Stoney's!"

I couldn't resist trying out Wicked Spoon after hearing so many rave reviews about it from my friends. Even though it's a bit out of the way for me, I finally decided to make the trip and see what all the fuss was about.\n\nUpon arriving, my group and I were relieved to find that we beat the usual dinner rush and were able to snag a table right by the windows. We took our time picking out plates of food, taking in the variety of options and the beautiful presentation. The price was a bit higher than what we were used to, but we were willing to pay for quality.\n\nThe food itself was good, but not quite at the level we were expecting based on the hype. And to our disappointment, the bill added up quickly as we tried different dishes and colors of plates. However, the service was great and our drinks were kept refreshingly cold, which was a definite plus in the Phoenix heat.\n\nOverall, while the Wicked Spoon may not have surpassed our expectations, we still had a pleasant dining experience. If I happen to be in the area again, I would definitely consider giving it another try. "
371,"I used to go to Keegan's for breakfast almost every weekend. I hadn't been by in a few weeks because I've been busy, and when I went in yesterday, I was surprised to find that they had a new breakfast menu. The old breakfast menu was composed of breakfast classics: three-egg omelets, pancakes, a breakfast burrito, huevos rancheros, etc-- it was tried and true, I never had a problem finding something that I wanted to eat, and at about $6.95 per entree, I couldn't go wrong. Well, the new breakfast menu is nothing like that. I had trouble finding something that I actually WANTED to eat. Instead of three-egg omelets for $6.95, they now have one and a half or two egg frittatas for $7.95-- so they raised the prices and you're now getting even less food for the money. Also, some of the dishes on the new breakfast menu just sound straight up disgusting. Puff pastry, eggs, and marinara for breakfast? No thank you. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to find a new breakfast joint."

On our first visit to this pediatrician, we were already skeptical after being informed that our appointment would be cancelled if we were more than 15 minutes late. Lo and behold, on the day of our appointment, we had to sit and wait for an hour and a half before the doctor even showed up. Despite our love for Candace, we couldn't justify the ridiculous wait times. And to make matters worse, when we tried to schedule our next appointment for a day when both parents could be there, we were met with rude and unhelpful behavior from the scheduler. After three attempts, we finally gave up and sought out a new pediatrician who was not only able to see us on the day we wanted, but was also extremely friendly. It's a shame that this pediatrician's office has such incompetent scheduling and lack of respect for their patients' time. We will not be returning."

Amn Hughley & PA Brown are an incredible duo at the Nellis AFB medical center. As a military brat and former active duty member myself, I have seen my fair share of medical professionals. But these two stand out above the rest. They have a level of heart and dedication that is unparalleled. They truly go above and beyond for their patients and it's evident that they genuinely care about making a difference. From my own personal experience, they have always been attentive and thorough in their care. I have complete faith in their abilities as they have consistently proven themselves as the cream of the crop. The Air Force hit the jackpot when they enlisted Hughley and Brown. So if you have the opportunity to seek medical treatment from this dynamic duo, I highly recommend taking it. They make the Air Force proud and embody what it means to be the best of the best. "
374,"Ugh, Marquee...\n\nI've been here a handful of times and I just never have a good time here. I'm not exactly sure why, but XS is just so much more superior than Marquee!\n\nEven though I don't like Marquee, I always end up coming here when I go to Vegas. I don't know why. Maybe because we are always forgiving and hoping Marquee will prove us wrong. So far, nope. Out of all the times I've been here, I've only had a remotely good time twice. Once when I went with my boyfriend and his friends and they got a table - it's always fun when you have a table, lol. And the last time I came here (couple weekends ago) when Sander van Doorn was playing was the only time I had a remotely good time here. Still, meh..I prefer XS.\n\nMarquee is located in the Cosmopolitan and I will admit that the venue is really nice. It gets pretty crowded though and the walkway is kind of narrow, so I don't like that about this club since it results in everyone pushing and shoving so they don't get separated from their group - doesn't help when everyone is drunk, too. Ugh. The outdoor area is pretty nice and I actually prefer to be out there than inside. There are a lot of cabanas and a nice pool. I hear their Dayclub is a lot better than their Nightclub, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out to compare.\n\nAside from all this, the thing I hate most about Marquee are those damn STAIRS TO GET IN. Gawwwwwd. MARQUEE IS NOT GIRL-FRIENDLY, I TELL YOU! There are like a million flights of stairs you need to climb before you get into the actual club. WTF?! By the time I get in there, my feet are already hurting. Ugh. They have elevators to get from floor to floor (they have different levels which is a cool concept) but they only let some people use it...L;HKADH0-9DAIHDP'HODK I can't.\n\nIn short, I don't plan on coming back here because my feet will hurt..unless it's for Dayclub in the summer.

I've been coming to the bar area of this Native New Yorker for a while now and I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with their sound system. Don't get me wrong, the service is always great and the servers all know us, making us feel like regulars. The food is also pretty good, and their drink menu has a nice selection. Plus, they have plenty of classy flat screens for us to watch sports on. But unfortunately, none of that can outweigh the awful sound system they have. Seriously, it's the worst I've ever heard at any of the places I go to. And don't even get me started on the internet jukebox that plays on its own every 5 minutes with songs I can't even understand. This is supposed to be a sports bar/restaurant, not a nightclub. And on top of that, the speakers are excessively loud and over-modulated, making it impossible to hold a conversation with my wife without having to yell over the music. It's really starting to take away from the overall experience of going to this place. I do love coming here, but the sound system is enough to make me reconsider sometimes. I hope they invest in a better one soon because as it stands, I would not recommend this place to anyone."
376,"I really hope to see these guys make it.. I went by one day too early and one of the guys came out to say hello and let me know when they would open that day. We finally made it down there last night to give them a try... kinda weird to walk into a BBQ place and not smell the BBQ! There were a few families in there, everyone was waiting for food. We gave our order to the 12 or 13 year old behind the counter and she placed it to her side and we sat down to watch her spend the next 10 minutes continuing to take orders... (Our slip was still on the counter..) Finally the entire stack of slips was sent to the back, we joked with the table next to us that we were probably on the bottom... After quite a wait the last family that walked in got their order and left... then the couple that came in behind us got their order as we sat and waited... by now we had gotten to know them a little and they were from Kansas City...  In their words the BBQ was ok... he felt that the meat should pull from the bone, which it defiantly did not do. They completed their meal and offered us some untouched ribs while we were STILL waiting for our food! We declined and finally the food comes out. Hubby takes the cornbread and immediately pushes it to the side of the table.. he refused to try it even, \""Its cake, not bread!\"" The ribs were ok... we pretty much thought the same, that it should pull from the bone more. The coleslaw was nothing spectacular and the rice/beans were pretty much left untouched. Not a place that we would go out of our way to go to by any means... :o("

My visit to Burger Bar was a bit of a letdown. I had made reservations for a Saturday night, not realizing that it was also a night for a big hockey game. As expected, the restaurant was bustling and loud, but what I didn't anticipate was the lack of organization. Our reservation seemed to have been lost, forcing us to sit at a table near the door where the cold air kept sweeping in. Thankfully, we were moved to a slightly better table after some persistence. \nDespite the chaos, our meals were well-prepared, delicious, and served hot. So no complaints there. However, our hopes for a satisfying finish to our meal were dashed when we looked at the dessert menu. Out of the seven options listed, three were not available. How disappointing! We ended up ordering the fried Mars bars, which were decent but clearly rushed. It was a shame to see something as simple as fried Mars bars not executed perfectly. \nI would advise against visiting on a busy night, especially during a big event like a hockey game or a show at the nearby Bell Centre. Clearly, the restaurant struggles to handle large crowds. On top of that, the floors were dangerously slippery, both upstairs and downstairs. A word of advice to the management - please dry or mop the floors and invest in a carpet for those snowy and icy weather days. Overall, my experience at Burger Bar was very disappointing. "

My recent experience at this Verizon store was far from pleasant. I had purchased a tablet from them and was promised a great deal, but ended up being charged much more than expected. As you can imagine, I was not happy. After multiple attempts to resolve the issue, I finally heard back from a store manager. While I appreciate their efforts, it took weeks and a lot of back-and-forth before my issue was resolved. And while the store is well laid out and has the convenience of covered parking, the customer service and overall experience was just not up to par. It's a shame, because with better communication and faster response times, this store has the potential for more positive reviews. But unfortunately, based on my experience, I cannot recommend this Verizon store."

Just had lunch at this place and boy, was it a letdown. Let's start with the good - the beer was cold and the service was quick. But that's where the positives end. As soon as I entered, I was hit with a strong smell that can only be described as a plumbing issue. Not the best way to start a meal, to say the least.

My hopes for a tasty, veggie-filled taco were quickly dashed when I received a plate of tacos with beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. Note to self: ""vegetable"" does not equal ""vegetarian"" here. And what taqueria serves tacos with lettuce and tomato instead of onions and cilantro? To top it off, the beans had no flavor and the rice was bland at best.

As a part of the lunch special, I was supposed to get a fountain soda. But when I asked for it, I was given a flat soft drink. Talk about a disappointment. And don't even get me started on the prices - a little too steep for what was served. To add insult to injury, they didn't even offer me a receipt when I paid. Talk about poor service.

Overall, I might consider giving this place a second chance, but I definitely wouldn't pay for it. I'll stick to the tried and true taqueria down the street. Lesson learned."

So I'm going to put my tastebuds to the rest on this restaurant compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants I usually go to around Charlotte.\n\nSo here's the deal. This place used to be Pho 98, and I only had the chance to go there once a very long time ago. Inside, they redesigned the place and the interesting thing I want to mention is that the back is where the cash register is.\n\nGiven the menu, I was happy to see such a large option of choices. I ordered their pho dac biet, fresh and fried spring rolls. My mother deviated and ordered one of their B\u00fan dishes. The portion, I thought was a little \""meh.\"" I mean the B\u00fan dish, vermicelli is dry with the option of the customer putting fish sauce for a little bit of flavor, wasn't so surprising in my opinion. I feel like other Vietnamese restaurants give you a lot more for your dollar. \n\nI felt as if yeah, sure it's in south side Charlotte and things can be a little more expensive but it still matters to me and how much you get with the extra money you spend. I guess all our money went to our service, which was great by the way... One thing to note was that when you sit down there is no utensils, not to worry it will come (they didn't forget.) After they served the first dish however, I thought they forgot and I was a little confused on why they would serve food before serving anything to eat with. I think they could really spend less time on the utensils if they set it up at each table beforehand.\n\nThe Pho that I ordered was okay. The portion was pretty good, a little less than I'm used to, but overall it wasn't bad. The broth was good, tasty and it's true they don't add any MSG, but I just didn't get that satisfied feeling of amazing that I usually get.\n\nOverall, from all the hype of everyone I was expecting godliness that would trump any other Viet restaurant. But, overall I just thought it was \""okay.\"" If I could give it more stars it would probably just another 1/2 star, but nothing more... One cool thing to note was that they do sell Banh Mi."

My friends and I were excited to visit this popular attraction in the city and decided to wait in line to purchase tickets. However, our experience quickly turned sour when we were met with disorganization and confusion from the staff. Not only were the ticket prices unclear (ranging from $60 to $35 depending on who you asked), but we were also hit with an additional $2 service charge per ticket. It was frustrating to see that no one seemed to have a clear understanding of what was going on. If you can, I would recommend saving your money and finding a different way to enjoy the city view, perhaps from the top of a parking garage. It's a shame that this place has such potential but fails to deliver on a smooth and enjoyable experience."

The lazy river was slower than some, the slide was closed part of the time and there is only one family pool. The flow rider was pretty awesome, though. We enjoyed the shallow entry of the pool for our toddler. \n\nThe most disappointing part of our trip was the service. There was one exceptional waiter at the flowrider, Nick. He was a glimmer of light for the hour we were watching our kids on the wave pool. Yet when we were at the family pool 90% of the time, service was terrible.

Unfortunately I fell ill on the second day of our stay so had to call a Doctor to the room. The receptionist promised to call the company to send one out ASAP, we waiting three hours with no word so called back... She hadn't called the Doctor because she'd misunderstood something I'd said.\nWe also had a guest moved in next door to us who was a chain smoker, filling our room with the foul aroma of fresh cigarette smoke. When we complained the hotel offered to switch our rooms which, although worked out well in the end, seemed really ridiculous considering we'd been in our apartment for two nights already and they were aware that I was deathly ill.\n\nOn saying that, when we did get moved (to the Augusta Tower) we were given an entire non-smoking floor and an absolutely breathtaking room... why we weren't given this to begin with, I don't know, as we were informed it was slightly less than the one we paid for.\n\nThe ambience on the Casino floor and helpfulness of the staff was top notch.

Another visit to this restaurant led to an average dining experience. I had been wanting to try this place for a while, but my expectations were not met. While there was supposed to be a happy hour, it was not clearly advertised and we were only informed of the deals when we received our bill. The discounted sushi rolls were nothing to write home about and did not impress me. We decided to stick with the traditional rolls, which were decent but also quite small in size. Usually, I judge a sushi place by the amount of wasabi provided, and in this case, it was a disappointingly small portion. They also did not offer ginger on the side. The soy sauce was too salty for my taste, so I ended up not using it. The miso soup was tasty, but lacked tofu. Overall, the food was okay but not worth the price. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon."

I ended up trying this restaurant because the place we originally wanted to go to was packed. And boy, was I disappointed. The service was absolutely terrible. Our server, a young dark-haired female (I'll spare her name) did not seem interested in actually doing her job. We waited for over 15 minutes just to get our coffee and water which we had ordered as soon as she came to our table. And when it finally arrived, we had to go get sugar and the water ourselves from the bartender. Our food took way too long to come out and our server only checked on us when it was convenient for her. And when it came time to pay, she didn't even run the card the first time and tried to cover her mistake with excuses. The service was just unacceptable.

But even worse than the service was the food. It was just average and definitely not worth the price. We only got coffee, water, and some average food yet our bill was still quite steep. I would not recommend this place to anyone and would much rather go to a Denny's where at least I know what to expect. The only good thing about this place was the cool atmosphere, but that doesn't make up for the terrible service and subpar food. There are much better options out there, so I would skip this place altogether if I were you."

Let's start with the good - the staff was always friendly and welcoming. And the room, as you can see from my posted photos, was nice and big. But that's where the positives ended for me. Housekeeping seemed to be non-existent. I couldn't believe that a candy wrapper, which was on the floor outside my room when I checked in, remained there for the duration of my stay. It's just a small wrapper, but it's a reflection of the overall cleanliness and attention to detail of the hotel - or lack thereof.

My group and I also had a frustrating experience with trying to get a taxi one evening. We waited in the designated taxi line but there were no cars available at the moment. A hotel employee walked by and saw us, but instead of offering to help, he just ignored us and acted busy with something else. We ended up having to walk to dinner because of this lack of assistance.

And don't even get me started on the rooftop bar being connected to the pool. They had to close the pool at 6 pm due to some wind, but shockingly, they also closed the bar! We could see a bartender behind the glass, but the door was locked, leaving us disappointed and thirsty. Not to mention, the noise from construction starting in the early hours made it impossible to sleep past 5:30 am.

Overall, I was really looking forward to my stay at this hotel, but unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations. For the price and the hype, I was expecting a much higher level of cleanliness and customer service. Needless to say, my group and I will not be booking our upcoming Vegas trip here. The search for the perfect hotel continues..."
389,"Exceptional variety across 9 stations including  seafood, american, mexican, italian, medittaranian, asian and desserts.  The seafood was my favorite with an excellent variety of offerings all cooked very well.  The meats at Americana were good, but the Mexican food was forgettable. Sushi was ok, but having eaten at Sushi Roku the night before it was anticlimactic to say the least.  Desserts were beautiful to behold but average to the taste. Bar is extra so for $50 either come hungry or go home.  Not a bad experience, but not one I will likely repeat."
390,This review is long over due ! Not happy with the way I heard one of the groomers speaking to a dog being groomed. That should of been a red flag to begin with. Last holiday season I was visiting a a close relative in the summerlin area during some time off from work and I decided to bring my terrier with me on vacation. She really needed a bath and hair cut badly so I found K9s through yelp. When talking to the groomer that would be working on my dog that day it seemed as if they were only half way listening to my requests and I felt shooed away with out finishing my last sentence about my dogs hair cut. Which probably explains why her ears were so uneven when she was given back to me. When i took her home i could see red marks all over her private area ! My poor baby was so irritated. Not to mention 2 of her nails were cut too far back and they let me know its not a big deal and that it happens all the time. Yea OK!! I will never ever bring my dog back to this place even if it is for an emergency out of state grooming

On a recent visit to Ben et Florentine, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of their pancakes. As a regular at this establishment, I've always enjoyed their menu but this time, they completely missed the mark. The pancakes I received looked more like thin crepes rather than fluffy, delicious pancakes. And to make matters worse, they had no distinctive flavor, not even their supposedly signature blueberry pancakes. It was a huge letdown.

But the disappointment didn't end there - the service from the male servers was abysmal as always. They were stressed and lacked any kind of smile. The only saving grace was the female staff, particularly my server Sabrina who was charming and friendly. However, their hospitality couldn't make up for the poor overall experience.

I used to be a regular at Ben et Florentine, but after this visit, I will only be coming back for their conventional items like eggs benedict, continental breakfast, and smoothies. The rest of the menu is forgettable and not worth the disappointment. I hope they can improve their quality and service in the future, otherwise, they risk losing more customers like myself."
392,Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick.
393,"Just went here tonight and they had the worst donuts I've had in my life. That includes Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme too. I love donuts and when I move to a new area I always like to check out ALL the highly reviewed donut shops. I had a boston creme donut that was filled with maybe a tablespoon of creme and was really small. The donuts were dried out (that's my fault because I went at 9PM) so I won't judge them too harshly on that part but it's still not enjoyable. The cake donuts with sprinkles were tiny and undersized. I ordered a chocolate covered buttermilk donut (normally really good if you get them at Rainbow) and the bread of the donut tasted like it was deep fried in oil that was a week old or something. Seriously, the donut tasted like old grease, to the point that it was a more prominent flavor than the chocolate frosting itself. I committed the ultimate sin and threw away the other donuts I ordered and that's a first in my life.\n\nI don't know what other people are talking about when they give these donuts great reviews but I'm guessing that these people have never eaten a real donut or a donut outside of Arizona. I don't get why all the donut shops here (golden,bosa,rainbow,etc) are copies of each other. I drove 45 minutes to Lamars Donut Shop to get some real donuts and that's BY FAR the best donut shop I've found since I moved here. Don't waste your money at Golden, you might as well go to QT and pick up a donut if you're that desperate. Even Rainbow is head and shoulders above this place."
394,"I booked a room here for a place to crash after last weekend's beer festival. During check-in, I discovered that we were getting a room across the bridge in the Luna building. We drove around, parked in the underground lot, and took the convenient elevator to the top floor. Everything great so far.\n\nThe room surpassed my admittedly meager expectations. Not sure if we got lucky or if they are all like this. It was very spacious and clean. The kitchenette has everything you might need--fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove. The separate bedroom is large for the single king bed it houses. Same thing for the bathroom--huge and bright with updated amenities. The balcony faced west and had a nice view of the lake. If there is one thing that needs attention, it's the outdated TVs. At least there was one in both the living room and the bedroom.\n\nIt later dawned on me that this building used to (or possibly still is) a condominium. The mailbox cluster out front was my first clue.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ended up on the sofa bed. At first contact, it seemed like it would be terribly uncomfortable. But we both woke up the next morning enjoying a great night's sleep. Perhaps that was the alcohol.\n\nMy one complaint? Why on Earth would you ever, EVER close the bridge? When we were walking from the room to the main village, we found that the bridge was closed until 6:30pm for a wedding. That's just a terrible idea. (1) It's very inconvenient for your guests. I admit that the walk around wasn't that bad in the end. But the idea that you're basically cutting your guests off from the majority of your resort is just silly. (2) The bridge is so unfinished. Why would you want to hold your wedding there? The security guy said it only happens a few times a year. How about never? It's dumb. Stop it.\n\nSo yes, I'm allowing that to bring my rating down. We definitely had a nice stay, but the bridge thing is just bad business."
395,"And the award for the saltiest chicken curry on the planet goes to...\n\nNo, really. I must have had a bag of salt in that chicken curry with my $5.75 lunch special. The one that strangely comes with sweet and sour chicken, rice, and egg drop soup.  Honestly, the quality wasn't terrible - but seriously. Salt city. Maybe it's MSG. Who knows! However, service was very quick. Food was out in no time. For the price, it isn't bad I suppose. Certainly wouldn't be my choice unless it was my only one. It's also fun to say you ate at Jacky Chan's."

We were looking for a quick and easy spot for pizza and stumbled upon this little pizzeria. The cute, small space was filled with the aroma of fresh dough and the walls adorned with photos of delicious-looking pizzas. The service was friendly and quick, we were able to order our large pepperoni pizza and antipasto without any issues. However, we were a bit disappointed to find out that they don't serve beer, which would have been a great addition to our meal.

When our pizza arrived, we were excited to try it but sadly it was just average. The crust was a bit too thin and lacked flavor, and the toppings were also nothing special. We actually enjoyed the antipasto dish more than the pizza itself. It's a shame because being from the SF area, we have high expectations for pizza and this just didn't meet them.

Service was also lacking as our antipasto came out after our pizza, which made us wonder if they had forgotten our order. Overall, the experience was just okay and we couldn't help but feel like we could have gotten better pizza for the price we paid. Maybe next time we'll try a different spot in the area with more options and a better overall dining experience. "

I am extremely disappointed with my experience at Rosemary's. While the food may have been delicious for some, the treatment I received from the staff was absolutely unacceptable. The owner, Nasir, was incredibly rude and accused my mother of purchasing the ring she was trying to exchange from somewhere else. When I went to pick it up, he refused to replace it without charging me and even had the audacity to call me ugly and make inappropriate comments. I was shocked by his behavior and will never be returning to this establishment. As the saying goes, beauty is only skin deep but ugly goes right to the bone. Avoid this place and its despicable owner at all costs."
398,"

I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. It seemed like it would be right up my alley - popular, featured on TV, and with a laid-back atmosphere - but both times I went, I was severely let down. The sandwiches were greasy and tasteless, and don't even get me started on the soggy fries. The bread was also a major disappointment - thick and flavorless, it added nothing to the already disappointing meal. Maybe I was just unlucky and went on two off days, but based on my experiences, I definitely won't be giving this place a third chance. I'll stick to my trusty Panda Express, at least they don't laugh or argue when they make a mistake."
399,"My husband and I went to Dos Caminos for our \""day-after our wedding\"" brunch. I used to come here when it was Agave and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was a tiny bit apprehensive. I'm glad we decided to give it a go!\n\nI will have to leave an update for this restaurant because we didn't have THE BEST experience, but it wasn't awful either,...so just the 3 stars will have to do for now. First of all, the seating on the patio is much better than it was under previous ownership. They have more tables outside and it feels more open. I've always loved that patio, but now it is a much more comfortable feel.\n\nWhen our server mentioned to us that we were there for brunch so we receive a complimentary cocktail if we would like, we were all about it. We took advantage and my hubby ordered a blended margarita and I ordered a Bloody Mary. I ended up having to send the Bloody Mary back because it tasted like peppered tomato juice. They had no problem substituting it though and I replaced it with a mimosa which was delicious. \n\nThe part that bothered us was that after we ordered our complimentary cocktail, we then found out from the server that our drinks were only complimentary if we ordered from the (very limited) brunch menu section. We were already half way through our drinks so we had to stick to that menu and there are really only a handful of options. Had we known this, we would have forgone the drinks and ordered from the lunch menu. \n\nWe ordered the breakfast quesadilla, one without bacon for myself, and we waited about 20 minutes after we placed our order and munched on the trio of salsa's in front of us. For those who don't like spicy food - STAY AWAY FROM THE orange salsa. My husband can't handle spice and he mistakenly thought that might be a mango salsa and he was wrong. It was incredibly spicy even to me and I loooove my spicy food. We were both pleased with our meal and the portion siize of these quesadillas are enough to feed 2 people easily. \n\nI will be back mainly for the lovely patio, but I also want to give their lunch and/or dinner menu a try."
400,"Very cool new spot in NODA. \nWas fortunate enough to attend yet another Trinumeral event here at the Chop Shop on 11-11-11. Security was tight, yet fair. \nCool location, at the end of 35th, across tracks is pretty much exclusively theirs. Security checkpoint to even get in the lot, I walked thankfully, but they were checking trunks!!\nOnce inside the place was nice and open, bar in the back, stage in the front. 2-3 pool tables right when you enter. \nGood prices at the bar except for the fact that (sorry ladies) unless you have boobs its very hard to get served, which is the main reason this place only got 3 stars. Everything else was great, except for the bar service, obviously catering to the people who were ordering groups of shots, and ignoring people who simply wanted a beer. They also ran out of a very popular beer i won't mention but its starts with PBR, very early in the evening. Come on, you are in NODA, with a huge party and don't stock the PRB, big FUBAR.\nWill come back, but don't look forward to the iffy bar service."

I had such high hopes for Real Foods, but unfortunately, my first experience was a complete letdown. The staff seemed to be more interested in preaching about their dietary preferences than actually helping customers. The range of products was overwhelming, but the atmosphere was anything but welcoming. I felt like I was being judged for not being a health-conscious individual. And let's talk about the food ‚Äì for a deli and grocery claiming to be the epitome of a healthy lifestyle, their produce was underwhelming. I couldn't find anything that truly stood out to me. And don't even get me started on their presentations. Instead of being informative and inspiring, they felt more like a sales pitch. I left feeling like I had wasted my time and hard-earned money. I won't be coming back, and I suggest you save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere. Real Foods may have a reputation for being trendy and healthy, but based on my experience, I don't see the appeal. "
402,This poor review is specifically for the groomer Susan.  We brought our dog in at 11am and said to pick up the dog in 2 hours.  When I came back at almost 4pm she did not even start grooming her.  She said she will start on her asap and instead did a 20 minute haircut that looked horrible.  I left the store and will never go back to this groomer.
403,"The first time this place was a half hour late. This second time, they were half an hour late again n I must have slept thru their half ass late knock.. Credited my card back- thank god. The only good thing that came from this joint. Try the doorbell or being on time next time. Guess that's why they work at Pizza Hut. Xoxo"
404,"

So, let me start off by saying that my friends and I came to this place with high hopes, especially after hearing about their famous 6lbs burrito. But boy, were we disappointed. The service at this place was beyond terrible. It honestly felt like they were encouraging their servers to be rude and ignore us.

First of all, we had to wait for 45 minutes just to get a table, which we were okay with because the place was packed. But then, we were seated and left with no menus for an additional 15 minutes. We tried getting the attention of the servers, but it seemed like they were going out of their way to avoid us. All we wanted was some acknowledgement of their terrible service, but we didn't even get a smile.

Finally, my sister's boyfriend took matters into his own hands and went to get the menus himself. Can you believe that? We had to fetch our own menus! At this point, we were pretty annoyed, but hoped that the food would make up for the terrible service. Spoiler alert: it didn't.

After waiting for a total of 25 minutes, our server finally stopped by to take our drink orders. By this point, we were ready to order our food as well. I was excited to try the 6lbs burrito, but was told it was only for competition and I couldn't order it. I even offered to pay the $20 for it, but was still denied. So, I settled for the smaller version of it. We also ordered some appetizers and other dishes, including chili-cheese fries and jalapeno poppers. And let me tell you, they were all a huge disappointment. The burrito was gross and tasteless, the fries were burned, and even the hot dogs were overcooked.

But what really put the nail in the coffin for this experience was the fact that we never received the birthday shots I had ordered. I was looking forward to celebrating my birthday with my friends, but the terrible service and food ruined it.

Overall, this place was a huge letdown. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, not even my worst enemy. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. Maybe even stick to frozen dim sum from an Asian grocery store, because it can't be any worse than this place. Trust me. "
405,"

I have to say, I was disappointed by my experience here. While the inside and outside of the building were clean and tidy, the same cannot be said for the food and service. My order seemed to have a recurring problem of being incorrect or missing items, forcing me to go back to the restaurant multiple times for a fix. And let's not forget the prime location of this branch - it seems like they have no competition in the area, so they can afford to let their service and quality slip. I will give credit where credit is due - my food did come out quickly. But what good is fast service if it's not done right? Needless to say, my minimal expectations for this chain were met...and that is not a good thing. I would suggest trying another location or even a different restaurant altogether to avoid the frustration of consistently having to go back for fixes. This place needs to step up their game if they want to compete with other restaurants in the area."
406,"On a normal day I would describe this park as: A rather small amusement park located on an island in the city of Montreal, where the pricing is average, the rides are average, the food is average, hell the whole park is pretty much average.\n\nOn Halloween however the park comes to life, with special haunted houses and people walking around in costume. \nThe one negative thing about that is however, that you have to pay extra for the haunted houses..even when you have a season pass. \n\nConclusion: It's alright, not a magical adventure, but it's something to do when you're bored and have the extra cash. \nPersonally, I'd stick to only going on/around Halloween, it's way more fun."

The level of service at this barbecue restaurant is simply atrocious. Not only did I have to deal with a manager named Brittany who had no idea how to properly spell the word ""barbecue,"" but she also had the audacity to accuse me of lying when I was charged twice for the same meal. And to top it all off, she rudely hung up on me when I tried to explain the situation. How is this kind of behavior acceptable in any business? Plus, the food was mediocre at best. Save yourself the trouble and find a place that knows how to properly operate and spell."

I must admit, I was initially impressed when the bartender offered us a free tasting of all their beers. However, that moment of excitement quickly faded when I took my first sip. The beers were light and refreshing, but that was about the only positive thing I can say. None of the beers were amazing, but at least they weren't nasty. But the real disappointment was the homemade root beer. I was expecting a delicious, unique brew but instead, it tasted like generic store-bought root beer.

The atmosphere of the brewery was underwhelming, to say the least. It didn't look nice from the outside, and the interior wasn't much better. And on top of that, it was uncomfortably hot inside. Definitely not the kind of environment I was hoping for to enjoy a cold beer.

On a positive note, the service was good, but it didn't make up for the overall disappointment. And the prices were cheap, but I would have gladly paid more for a better experience.

Overall, this was a letdown. I was excited to try out this brewery, but it turned out to be a mediocre experience. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless you're desperate for a cheap beer in an unimpressive setting. Save your money and spend it somewhere else."

The lunch buffet at CiCi's was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the service was friendly and welcoming, with Ms. Super Perky making sure we were taken care of. The soup and salad were decent enough, but nothing to write home about. And while the pasta dish and garlic cheese bread were passable, the pizza definitely left something to be desired. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. However, the price for the buffet is definitely a steal, especially with the current promotion for their 25th anniversary. Unfortunately, the low price is not enough to make up for the lackluster food options and mediocre taste. And don't even get me started on the parking situation ‚Äì it's a nightmare trying to get back onto the main road. Overall, this place is just okay. I might come back for the cheap lunch deal, but it's definitely not my first choice for a pizza fix."

This place definitely did not live up to my expectations. The smell of the food coming from the restaurant was utterly deceiving. I was craving fish and thought this trendy spot would hit the spot. Boy, was I wrong. The service was mediocre at best, probably due to the fact that it was so busy. But when I asked about one of their dishes, the server seemed completely indifferent and didn't offer much help. \n\nI decided to go all out and order the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Skate Wing. The escargot was a huge letdown. The garlic herb sauce was so buttery that I felt it linger on my lips even after wiping my mouth. Not exactly what I was looking for in terms of flavor. And the snails themselves were disappointingly chewy. \n\nThankfully, the skate wing saved the meal a little bit. The smell was divine and the texture was light and delicate, just as I had hoped. But then came the capers, which added an overpowering tartness to the dish. It just didn't work for me. The only saving grace were the homemade chips, which were absolutely delicious and probably the best part of the meal. \n\nI had high hopes for this place, but it fell short in many regards. The fish was decent, but the other aspects of the meal were underwhelming. Maybe I'll give it another chance and try some different dishes, but for now, I'll stick to French cuisine elsewhere."
411," Overall, the service is good (polite waitresses and bartenders).

Let me start by saying how much I adore country music, so when I heard about a little bar that catered to my love for twangy tunes, I had to check it out. The atmosphere at this place is definitely its standout feature - with walls adorned in dollar bills and license plates, you can tell this place has a lot of character. And the crowd? Welcoming and lively, although on the older side. The solo performer, Russ, was the cherry on top with his rendition of The Cowboy Rides Away. One thing to note though, he does pass around a ""tip plate"" to each table, so be prepared to give if you want to keep the music playing. The service was decent, with just one person handling the whole place. But they were polite and attentive, which always makes for a pleasant experience. The food options were limited, but what they did have was pretty good, especially for bar food. However, I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about. All in all, this bar has its charm and is a great option for a laid-back Sunday afternoon. Give it a try and see for yourself!"
412,"My order was completely wrong. I have no idea how I order a build your own breakfast crepe, list all of the items I want in my breakfast and end up with the breakfast burrito? The waitress was writing for a while when I ordered and I thought she just wasn't short-hand writing my order which is unusual.. I have no idea what she was writing because when my order came out wrong she showed me the order she had written down (like that solved anything) and all that was written was 'burro'. I had to ask 'so when I said I would like to build my crepe and listed off mushrooms, spinach, ham and onions you heard burrito?' (which obviously has none of those ingredients) her response was 'well, that's what everyone orders'. Are you kidding me???? \n\nAnyway, I ate the burrito because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for my food. it was actually really good I can see why other people order it but I was really craving mushrooms.\n\n#dayruiner"
413," My dog just wants a good groom and happy customer experience!


I recently took my dog to this place for grooming and let me tell you, it was not a pleasant experience. I had heard great things about their self-wash area, but my encounter with the groomer named Michelle was far from satisfactory. First of all, when I dropped my dog off, she didn't even take the time to greet me or ask any necessary questions. She was too busy handling another dog and simply told me to put my dog in the cage. 

After waiting for 6 hours, I had my friend pick up my dog since I couldn't make it. She paid the fee and tip, but when I saw my dog, I was disappointed. His hair wasn't cut, nails weren't trimmed, and his left ear was red and irritated. When I called to express my concerns, instead of apologizing and trying to make things right, Michelle made excuses and even blamed me for not being clear with what I wanted. How unprofessional! 

As icing on the cake, my dog ended up with an ear infection after the grooming session, which I had to spend an additional $60 to treat. And let me tell you, trying to put ear drops on a traumatized dog is no easy feat. This whole experience left my poor pup scared and hesitant when it comes to grooming. Talk about a terrible customer experience!

Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place for grooming. They may have a good self-wash area, but Michelle's lack of professionalism and disregard for her customers' concerns completely ruined my experience. My dog just wanted a simple trim and a pleasant grooming experience, but instead, he got trauma and an ear infection. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this establishment."

The sushi at this place was decent, but everything else really fell short. My husband and I came here for the lunch specials and were pretty disappointed. The rolls were the only saving grace, they tasted fresh and flavorful. The tempura was also decent, but not anything amazing. However, the spicy tuna rolls were a letdown - they lacked flavor and were even warm. The bento box salad was honestly just sad and the edamame wasn't even warm or appetizing. The spicy chicken dish was a bit questionable, both in terms of being actual chicken and in spice level. I would say skip this place and find somewhere else to satisfy your sushi cravings. "

After hearing rave reviews about this breakfast joint, I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfying. The first thing I noticed upon entering was the overwhelming smell of grease and the sound of a loud, spiky-haired employee talking down to a customer. It was unsettling, to say the least. But then I remembered, this is just off a major highway, so I gave it a chance.

The wait time, as expected, was long. It seemed like the staff was too busy chatting and laughing with each other to bother filling up the coffee urn or bringing out our orders together. It was chaotic and unprofessional.

Now, I'm no stranger to chain restaurants and the standard service they provide. But this place took it down a notch or two. The atmosphere was lackluster and the service was even worse. I couldn't help but think that my experience would have been better at the IHOP in the Charlotte University area, where the service was at least competent.

All in all, I was extremely disappointed with my visit to this big box breakfast joint. The food was mediocre and the service was a complete letdown. If you want a hassle-free breakfast experience, I suggest avoiding this place. Trust me, there are better options out there."
416,"Nothing more than a glorified Denny's, this place gets the job done after a long night in Vegas. They offer your full fare of food. \n\nBEWARE: Their full breakfast menu ends at 11am.

417,"This review is based solely on this experience because I love Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf as a whole. \nI stopped there today to get an iced tea and was asked if I wanted it sweetened.  I said yes, and asked if I could have simple syrup or agave syrup because I noticed that they have it.  She asked me how many pumps and I said two and then she gave me the total of $2.49 and directed me to the window to pay.  When I pulled up the person at the window said my total was $3.60 something. I told her that the other person told me it was $2.49 and she replied that they have to charge extra if you get agave nectar. \nTwo problems with this:\n\n#1. She should have told me there was an extra charge for it. \n\n#2. A dollar something charge for 2 pumps???  Ridiculous. \n\nI don't mind paying extra for something I want, but this is not a fair business practice."

The donuts at People's Bakery were a huge disappointment. My wife and I had heard great things about this place and were excited to try it out. But boy, were we let down. The selection was lackluster and the quality was subpar. It's no wonder they don't offer scones anymore, probably because they couldn't get them right in the first place. And don't even get me started on the prices - they were definitely not as great as others have claimed.  \nBut what really ruined our experience was the customer service. The woman at the counter seemed more interested in her phone than helping us, and when she did finally acknowledge us, she was rude and dismissive. We couldn't even find a decent place to sit and enjoy our mediocre donuts.  \nSave yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere for your sweet treats. Don't fall for the hype surrounding this place - it's nothing special and definitely not worth the trip. We won't be returning, that's for sure."
419,"Decent enough... They were super busy, as the NFL playoff games were being shown. Service was expectedly a bit on the slower side because of that, but they didn't rush us or pressure us to order more food/drinks while we were there.  I found the mango lemonade to be super sweet. We got the nacho burger and fries, which were both way too salty. The wings, however, were good.  Lots of TVs, and they happily split the checks and prepared a to-go order at our request."
420,"I finally made my way back to this place again few months ago because I wanted to have their gnocchi and bread again. It was a huge disappointment. The bread was nothing like the first time I had which was soft and fluffy, instead this time was cold and nothing out of ordinary. Even more disappointing, the gnocchi was overcooked and too soft compared to before and the flavor was just okay. When manager came by and got the check , she asked us about our dinner. I told her honestly that I didn't like it as much as I did before. She just told me it's the same chef all along. Oh well, will not be returning."

I had heard great things about this place and was excited to try it out for a cozy dinner on a cold night. The atmosphere was surprisingly romantic for such a small spot. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype. First of all, the service was lacking. Our waiter seemed completely uninterested in explaining the menu or making any recommendations. The lack of enthusiasm was off-putting, to say the least. Then, our food arrived after a longer wait than expected. My boyfriend and I ordered the Curry Squash, which we were told was the best in the city. However, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. It was good, but not great. And definitely not the best I've ever had. The flavors were lackluster and the texture was a bit off. To top it off, the portions were huge and we ended up with way too much leftover. We were so underwhelmed that we didn't even bother taking it home. Overall, I was not impressed with Lao Laan-Xang. I expected more from a highly recommended spot."
422,"After visiting the Serendipity in New York, I had to visit the one in Vegas, and it just didn't compare. After falling in love with the Frozen Hot Chocolate there I thought it would be the same here but that wasn't the case at all, maybe I came on an off day or something because the Frozen Hot Chocolate here tasted like a shake that I could get from a fast food joint."
423,"My dog and I walk this park a few times a week.  The park is clean and pet friendly, obviously.  They have a great outdoor amphitheater, although I have never seen anyone perform there.  For the most part people pick up after their animals.  I think having more pet stations would help.  The park is well kept and offers a lot of space to sit and read, play ball with your pet, fish, skate, bike or just hang out."
424,"I've been to Vegas a lot.  I usually stay at the Venetian/Palazzo and I love it there.  This time, however, I met the fam and stayed at Caesar's.  While it looked nice and seemed rather well built a lot of things were broken or non-functional.  First the jacuzzi in the room was broken.  We paid for an upgrade and got a broken jacuzzi.  That's a big fail.  Another thing was the ice maker and the soda machine on our floor.  Both were broken...for the entire 5 days we were there.   Another thing was the lack of ramps.  When rolling heavy luggage on the way to the room it would be nice not to have to lug it up stairs, even if there are only 4 or 5 of them.  Other than that, however, I enjoyed my stay.  For the right price, I wouldn't be against staying there again.  I mean very little time was spent in the room anyway because, hey, it's Vegas."

I recently brought in a frame to Aaron Bros that had been previously framed by Nick. Unfortunately, the glass had broken and when the technician took it apart, we found out that Nick had actually used SCOTCH TAPE to fix the print to the matte. As someone who used to work in a frame shop, I know this is a major faux pas. It's like fixing a car hose with duct tape - not a professional move. Even if the glass hadn't broken, eventually the print would have come loose and needed repairs. Not impressed with Nick's framing skills.

But that's not all - when it comes to frame and matte choices, Nick seems to lack imagination. His go-to recommendation is black, simply because it's his favorite color. I mean, come on, really? Can we try something a little more creative here?

To top it all off, the radio station playing in the background of Nick's shop made my visit unbearable. As a customer, I have the right to choose where I spend my money, and part of that decision is based on the environment I'll be in. But when I found myself trying to have a conversation with Nick while competing with blaring right-wing AM radio hosts, I knew I couldn't continue doing business there. If Nick only wants dittoheads as customers, then he's definitely achieved his goal. But for those of us who prefer a more neutral, peaceful workspace, this is not the place to go."
426,Went to Poppys tonight with a friend. Had Marilyn as our waitress and she was awful. Didn't smile or hardly talk to us. She was so slow and hardly checked on us. We we were done it took her 15 mins to get us our check because she didn't check on us. When we finally got the check she put on the table and didn't even say HAVE A NICE NIGHT or anything. Extremely non friendly and I would never want her as my waitress again. She is the women with the lip work done. Hope the manager of this place sees this and trains her better. I work in customer service and know what I am talking about. I wanted to say something to her personally but didn't think it was my place to tell. Won't be going back. Btw food was ok.

My husband and I decided to book a last-minute trip to Las Vegas and were lucky enough to snag a room at this iconic hotel. We stayed in a Neapolitan suite and two GO rooms, all of which were clean and met our expectations. The hotel has a certain charm to it, being one of the older casinos on the strip.

Unfortunately, our stay coincided with some construction next door as they were tearing down Bills. It was a bit annoying to look at, but we didn't hear any noise from our rooms and the pool area was still pristine. 

Now, let's talk about the food. We ordered a variety of dishes to try and were overall pleased with the taste. The Southern Yard Bird burger was definitely the standout - the perfect blend of flavors and the jalape√±o poppers served in a shot glass of dipping sauce were a unique twist. However, the service was a major letdown. From the moment we sat down until we asked for the bill, our server and waitress seemed to be in a hurry to get us out of there. Kind of a bummer considering the hotel's reputation.

All in all, this hotel is a solid choice for a stay in Vegas. The rooms are clean and the atmosphere is legendary. But just be aware of the potential for subpar service. Maybe it's just a case of LV Public School dropouts as our waiter and waitress, but it definitely put a damper on an otherwise enjoyable trip. Would we stay here again? Probably, but only after exploring other options first. "
428,This place not bad. Pretty good for a burger place. Burgers were delish! I got the bacon cheeseburger  on multigrain bread. Really yummy! The reg fries were good. Don't bother ordering the shoe string onion things .. They're freaking oily and a waste of money. The rosemary fries are ok but too too oily. The prices are ok a bit much for a burger. $5.99 for bacon cheeseburger $2.99 for reg fries. $6.99 I believe for the bigger version of the AZ burger which my bf said was pretty good.

I recently went to this sports bar with some friends to watch a UFC fight. The atmosphere was lively and the place was packed, but unfortunately, our experience was not as enjoyable as we had hoped. Firstly, it was difficult to get the attention of our waitress, who seemed overwhelmed with the crowd. It took her nearly 40 minutes to take our order, and even longer to bring us our food. And when it finally did arrive, my wings were not at all what I had ordered. I had specifically asked for ""HOT"" wings, but what I got was more like ""Honey BBQ"" or ""Honey HOT"" wings. I didn't want to cause a fuss on such a busy night, so I just ate them anyway. Big mistake. Less than an hour later, my stomach was churning and I was rushing to the bathroom multiple times throughout the night. I can't say for sure, but it definitely felt like there was something wrong with those wings. \n\nAside from the poor service and questionable food, the TVs at this place are also not the best quality. The one we were sitting next to had red spots, sparkles, and burn marks on the screen, which made it really difficult to watch the fight. It was quite distracting and even made my eyes water. \n\nOverall, I won't be coming back to this bar. The bad service, subpar food, and uncomfortable viewing experience have left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) and I don't plan on returning."
430,"You always know what to expect with Festival in the Park.  Lots of crowds, many many art vendors, fair food and no parking.  There are performances from local groups and schools too!  If you are lucky it will be a gorgeous sunny day that isn't too hot.\n\nWe took a blanket this year and just people-watched which is always fun here.     Freedom Park is a great place to hang out and watch the doggies sniff each other's butts.  Always a great time but glad it is just once a year!"

Okay, I had heard great things about this doctor's office from some friends and decided to give it a try for my chronic back pain. I arrived 10 minutes before closing time, hoping to get a full consultation. However, the receptionist seemed annoyed and told me that I should have come earlier if I wanted a proper appointment. I understand they were closing soon, but I feel like it's their job to see patients until their closing time, regardless of when they walk in. Nonetheless, I decided to schedule an appointment for the next day.\nThe office itself was clean and well-maintained, but I was disappointed with the lack of attention and care I received during my appointment. Despite having a long wait time, I felt rushed through and didn't get the comprehensive evaluation I was hoping for. When I tried to ask questions about my treatment plan, the doctor seemed impatient and dismissive.\nIn this age of technology, it's easy to look up office hours and plan accordingly. However, I do think the staff should have been more accommodating and understanding of my situation. I understand that the doctor was busy, but I was expecting a little more attentiveness and empathy from a medical professional.\nIn conclusion, while the office may be clean and organized, the quality of care and customer service fell short of my expectations. If you have a lot of time to wait and don't mind feeling like a nuisance, then this office might be for you. But for a better experience, I would suggest looking elsewhere. "
432,"AWFUL.  Avoid this place all together.  It's a far walk from the rooms with TERRIBLE facilites.  There is a single hot tub in the facility & it's slightly larger than a typical bath.  The co-ed areas are a nice idea (esp. for a couple), but somewhat lame.  The wave relaxation area had several non-functional chairs.  \n\nMy advice:  Skip the Canyon Ranch & head over to the MGM spa."

I was really excited to finally try Ocha after hearing rave reviews about their Pad Thai. The portions were definitely generous, and the flavors were spot on - not too sweet or too spicy, just perfect. However, I was a bit disappointed by the speed of service. It took about 20 minutes to get a table, which is understandable, but then it took another 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 15 minutes to even order our food.

Once our food finally arrived, it was delicious and definitely lived up to the hype. However, I couldn't help but notice that the waitstaff seemed a bit overwhelmed and the kitchen was definitely behind on orders. I would have loved to enjoy my meal a little more instead of constantly waiting for the next course. And when it came time to pay our bill, it took another 20 minutes for our server to come back and process our payment.

Overall, while the food at Ocha was fantastic, the service definitely left something to be desired. If they could improve their speed and efficiency, this would easily be a five-star experience. As it is, I'll still be coming back for the amazing Pad Thai, but I'll make sure to budget a bit more time for the overall dining experience."
434,"I am beginning to think some of the birds there \""need\"" rescuing.   They recently received 30 or so parakeets from a hoarder & one was so bad, it did not have many feathers on her body and was caged in a tiny, tiny cage with another - which had no beak to peck the poor girl.   I felt bad & went & bought a brand new bigger cage for the 2 so they would have more room & be more comfortable.  I did not want anyother birds in this cage.  Well I came back the next day to check on her & sure enough!  another parakeet was in there - pecking on her!   She did not look like the still playful girl of yesterday.  I was so mad.  The stupid woman there promised she would not put any other parakeet in there.  She also told me today she has seen no pecking...  well within 5 minutes of me being there today, the featherless bird got pecked twice!  and was just sitting there.  OMG    what kind of people are running this place.  They are suppose to zoom in & be kind to these abused birds & they are idiots!     This is not the first complaint I've heard about this woman working there."

We decided to give this place a try after seeing it featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. Excited by the prospect of trying some delicious, local eats, we ordered a few different types of wings - 13 mild, 13 garlic butter parm, and 6 jalapeno gold. Sadly, our expectations were not met. The wings were hot, but not in a good way. The mild wings were barely coated in sauce and the garlic butter parm was mostly just butter. The jalapeno gold had some flavor, but were overcooked and lacked that satisfying crunch. And don't even get me started on the price - we ended up paying $30 after tip for this disappointment. I'm usually not very picky when it comes to food, especially being 7 months pregnant and craving just about anything, but these wings were a major letdown. And to make matters worse, the place just didn't seem very well-maintained. I couldn't help but notice the dust on the pictures and baseboards, which were right where we were sitting. A good deep clean could really improve the atmosphere here. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone, despite its appearance on a popular TV show. We'll be sticking to our regular wing joint from now on."
436,"Here is an update on my previous 1-Star rating...\n\nEli called and apologized for not responding to my two voice mails that I had left him. Apparently, they were having some issues with their voice mail system. No problem, since it sounds like it's not their fault. I decided to give them a chance and they were able to come out three days later to do a free estimate. It was nice that they didn't require me to be at the house while they did the estimate. Eli emailed me the next day with three high quality pictures of the yard and a short estimate.\n\nI called Eli today to ask him to beat a competitor's price that had also given a free estimate and he was unwilling to do so, citing a busy season of work. All in all, once they fixed their voice mail problem I had no issues with AMS Landscape other than that they were unwilling to negotiate on price, which is understandable if your business is going well. I WOULD recommend AMS to others based on their customer service, but since no work was done I am unable to grade their landscape work."
437,Wasnt really feeling it. If your in the neighborhood I guess it's worth it but don't make the drive. The food was just okay the service was really good but couldn't redeem my  tummies disappointment. I was super excited about their bottled fanta too but sadly it was flat. Just sad and flat :( Not worth the gas to go back. Everything was just ok I really thought the yelpers had my back on this one but I guess you get led astray every once in awhile.
438,"Once in a while, it's possible that a restaurant can have a bad night. Like going on your first date with spinach on your front tooth. But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art. \nMy first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \""garlic bread\"" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it.\nService was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere.\nSo I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife.\nThird times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right.\nCleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them.\nSuffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana."
439,"Bought a dozen cupcakes using a Groupon. Cupcakes were ok, but there are much better places in town in my opinion.  The cupcake itself tasted like something I could make at home.  I thought the frosting was better than the cupcake so that was a positive.  I prefer Retro cupcakes in the northwest.  For nearby The Cupcakery is superior to Caked.  Improve the actual cupcake by making it more dense and larger and I'd come back.  For now, I'll go elsewhere."

I can't believe I'm saying this, but unfortunately, I would not recommend Radio Melano. At first, I was really excited to check it out after hearing so many great things about it. But as soon as I walked in, I was disappointed. The ambiance was off, with cheap decorations and a slightly dingy feel.

To make matters worse, the menu was all over the place. It seemed like they were trying to offer too many options and as a result, nothing really stood out as exceptional. I ended up ordering the ""famous"" tuna crudo and was completely underwhelmed. The fish was chewy and had a strong fishy smell, which is never a good sign. My dining partner had the same experience with their dish.

But what was really the icing on the cake for me was when I ordered a cocktail and ended up with the wrong drink. I went with it, thinking maybe I'll discover something new and delicious, but unfortunately, it was nothing special.

I have to give them credit for their efforts with the ambiance and cocktails, but when it comes down to it, the food just didn't deliver. And when you're paying good money for a meal, the food should be the main attraction. I'll stick to their sister restaurants from now on."

I found myself at Evo on a Monday night, after my date with my girl at 5th and Wine was cut short due to their surprisingly early closing time. I convinced her to try Evo, and being a self-proclaimed foodie, she only somewhat trusted my judgment in food. I mean, just look at the other places I've reviewed (Pranksters Too and Los Betos - I like easy and cheap, not necessarily quality). But to my surprise, Evo was a standout in terms of atmosphere, food, and service. 

Walking into Evo, we were greeted with a lively and laid-back atmosphere, where people from all walks of life could come and hang out. The only downside to this place was the slightly higher prices, but hey, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, my go-to beer, Coors, was out of stock, and so was my second choice - the peach beer. But this is where things took a pleasant turn. Our bartender, Jessie (I think), quickly became my girl's new BFF, and I was left there with no beer. Jessie, being a fantastic bartender, apologized and brought me a beer that was both light and flavorful. 

As we enjoyed our drinks and the delicious bread with infused oil, our porkbelly arrived, and let me tell you, it was a sight to behold. The size was substantial, and the bacon syrup surrounding it was like heaven in my mouth. My girl was ecstatic and had already declared Jessie as her new best friend. The food and service were so good that I was practically the fifth wheel to the amazing foursome that was Booze, Porkbelly, Jessie, and Jessie's Girl. 

Overall, Evo exceeded my expectations and made for a fun and entertaining Monday night. It may be a little on the pricey side, but the quality of food and service more than makes up for it. I can't speak for the weekend crowd, but if you're looking for a good time with great food and service, Evo is definitely a solid option."

My partner and I chose to dine at Gallaghers for our New Years Eve celebration, expecting a top-notch dining experience. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Despite calling ahead to confirm that their full menu would be available, we were greeted with a limited menu with no substitutions allowed. To make matters worse, our reservation was not honored until 30 minutes after our scheduled time, leaving us with even less time to enjoy our meal. The manager apologized, but that did little to improve our experience. To add insult to injury, the food took a whopping 50 minutes to arrive at our table, leaving us feeling rushed through our meal. Despite the chaos, the food itself was delicious, but it was overshadowed by the stress and disappointment of the evening. We have dined at Gallaghers in New York City for NYE before and it was a completely different, more organized experience. We were hoping for the same here in Las Vegas, but unfortunately, that was not the case. It's possible that on a regular evening, this restaurant may shine, but our New Years Eve experience left a sour taste in our mouths. Disappointing."

The sales guy came out for an estimate, and after an hour and a half of my husband and I listening to how great the company is and  how great the windows are, we get a quote that was 1500 for one window on my balcony....the total was $2058 so that is 1500 for one window after the $500 discount, which is fine. My husband and I were going to let him know after we talked about it and decided when we would be able to have it installed by the end of the month. He calls his \""boss\"" and his \""boss\"" tells him to walk out of the deal.

They are refunding our money for the Living Social deal but I am disappointed and also feel like our time was wasted.

I was really excited to try Bassett Street Brunch Club for the first time during NEWvember. The place was pretty empty on the Monday morning we went, but I could see how it would be a great place to study with its outlets and free parking lot (just remember to get your ticket validated).

We started off with a chocolate hazelnut doughnut as a breakfast appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. My friend Derek ordered a horchata latte which he raved about, while I stuck with a cappuccino that was pretty good. We were both looking forward to our main dishes.

Derek's chilaquiles was a huge plate and he loved the surprise kick of peppers. However, my Farmer's Hash was a bit of a disappointment. I was excited about the veggies, but unfortunately, I found bits of bacon mixed in. As someone who doesn't eat meat, this was a big downer for me. I also noticed that my portion of veggies was significantly smaller than Derek's. Despite these issues, the eggs and rye bread were delicious and the veggies seemed perfectly cooked. Our waitress was extremely nice and quickly brought me a new plate, and even took my meal off our bill. Another staff member also came over to apologize, which we appreciated.

We do plan on going back and giving it another try, but there are a few things that could be improved. The sun is super bright in the morning and the shades, unfortunately, do not do much to block the glare and heat. It would be great if they could find a solution for this. Overall, we would give Bassett Street Brunch Club a solid 4 stars for our first visit. Hopefully, our next experience will be even better."

Not excellent, not great, but good.\n\nI found it WAY too crowded and noisy for my taste, but I suppose that's a good thing for the restaurant's bottom line, and they probably wouldn't have it any other way.  Things like service-staff training and quality control must be top notch there, because every waitstaff person I have dealt with there is uniformly pleasant, well-informed, fast, and helpful.  Similarly, in the four or five visits I have made, I have never had a QC nightmare with undercooked or overcooked food or screwed up orders - even when my wife ordered a fairly complicated custom sandwich.  For that, they defintiely deserve kudos because it is hard to tolerate inconsistency at a place like this.  But they are indeed consistent.....but unfortunately, it is only consistently \""good\"" food, nothing special, especially at these prices.\n\nThis would be an easy 4-star if they found a way to shave 20% off the prices.  Just too much green for just normal \""good\"" food, if you know what I mean.\n\nBut I like to focus on the positive, so I will say with confidence that the truffle-oil fries are a real treat, and well worth the $6."

I just don't understand the hype surrounding this place. Sure, the atmosphere is trendy and full of beautiful people, but at the end of the day, I go to a restaurant for the food. And let me tell you, the sushi here is nothing to write home about. It's average at best, and the prices are outrageous for what you get. I could go to Benihana and get twice the amount of sushi for half the price. And don't even get me started on their happy hour. I mean, who charges that much for a measly roll on their ""special"" menu? It's a shame because I was really looking forward to trying this place, but I left feeling disappointed and ripped off.

We walked in, and after about a minute, a lady walked by and said that someone would be with us. This was said despite the fact that there were two other guys not doing anything when we walked in. She ended up coming back shortly simply saying \""hi guys\"" and not even offering her name nor asking for ours. She was trying to figure out what we were looking for which is standard, it seems. But when I responded to the question of what my \""ideal apartment\"" would have, she simply said \""oh, okay\"". She didn't mention that they had or didn't have the things I was wanting. What was the point of asking me then? The grounds were nice and the pool area was a bit better than some I've seen. The apartment itself looked like the Domain and Dwell Apts, which we were told that the current company bought it from them. I know it was WestCorp, because the brochure still had their info on it. Other than that, she didn't try to get me to leave anything to hold an apartment or offer up any other info that might be helpful. I was asked if there were any other questions I had. I didn't even have motivation to ask. I was done. Not impressed. If that is how a non-resident was treated, I can completely agree with the other bad reviews I've seen for this property. Good luck!"

The cleaning service at this establishment seemed great at first with a good variety of options. However, the experience quickly went downhill when it came to customer service.

But the final straw was when I found a squished dead ROACH in my food. And not just any roach - a 3"" one with its guts hanging out. This was enough to traumatize me and I will not be returning."

I was excited to try out Crazy Mocha for the first time, especially since it seemed to have so many locations in the city. Unfortunately, my experience at the Murray location left a lot to be desired. While the space was large and had plenty of seating, the drinks and service were subpar.

I ordered a tea and was unimpressed with the selection. And despite the prime location and free internet, the slow and unenthusiastic baristas made for a lackluster atmosphere. But the real disappointment came when I tried to connect to the wifi, only to find that my device couldn't connect. I asked for help from the staff, but they seemed bored and uninterested in assisting me.

The crust was inedible and the toppings didn't taste very fresh. It's safe to say that I won't be ordering from here again. I'm not sure what went wrong with this particular order, as I have had great experiences in the past, but this time was a let down. Sadly, I cannot recommend this place for a satisfying meal. "

My husband and I were excited to try out the breakfast options at this Taco Bell location during our busy weekend. However, our experience quickly turned sour when we noticed a discrepancy between the menu prices and what was charged at the register. When we brought this to the attention of the manager, she was huffy and unapologetic, claiming that the menu was wrong. Despite our insistence on paying the advertised price, she refused to budge and instead seemed annoyed with us for pointing out the mistake. Needless to say, based on this manager's attitude, we will not be returning to this Taco Bell. It's a shame that a simple mistake and lack of customer service can ruin a potentially enjoyable dining experience. We suggest caution when dining here."

So, I decided to try this place while I was at work for lunch. It was a slow day and I was hoping to get my food quickly and enjoy a peaceful meal. The chips and salsa were automatically brought out to me, but to my disappointment, the chips were not fresh. They were stale and felt like they had been sitting out for a while. And don't even get me started on the salsa. It had a giant piece of cilantro sticking out of it, a little excessive if you ask me. Onto the main course, which came out relatively fast, but tasted just okay. Nothing to write home about. The food was hot, which I appreciate, but that's about all the positive things I have to say about this place. The service was subpar and the ambiance was lacking. It seems like this place is just coasting by on their convenient location. Not terrible, but definitely not worth a second visit. Lesson learned."

After hearing rave reviews about this place, I was excited to try it out. However, my experience was far from enjoyable. My friend and I arrived at 1:30 and waited 35 minutes for our salads. We decided to sip on our ice water while patiently waiting, but the server never bothered to check on us or apologize for the delay, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy at all.

When our salads finally arrived, the lettuce was barely cool and the grilled chicken on top was completely ice cold. We took one bite and immediately lost our appetites. I wouldn't call it a dine-n-dash, as we did pay for our drinks, but we definitely walked out without finishing our meals. Safe to say, we won't be recommending this place to anyone.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and fancy, but it seemed like they were trying too hard to be fancy instead of embracing the true vibe of New Orleans. The Sazerac we ordered was watered down, but the charbroiled oyster appetizer was the only redeeming factor of our meal.

The Caesar salad was nothing special, just what you would expect from a Caesar salad. The Atchaya half catfish-half crawfish etouffee was the highlight of our meal, full of delicious flavor. However, that joy was short-lived as we were then served the worst jambalaya of our lives. It tasted like they just dumped a box of spices on top without bothering to mix it in. And to make matters worse, I ordered it with chicken and shrimp but received only chicken and the worst andouille sausage I've ever tasted. It was like eating a hot dog with spices.

We decided to end our meal with the banana fosters, hoping for a sweet and satisfying ending. But alas, it was an utter disappointment. The rum used to caramelize the bananas was either non-existent or very minimal, and the bananas themselves were clearly not ripe enough as they lacked any sweetness.

The service was fine, nothing to write home about. However, the slow service just added to the disappointment of our overall experience. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this restaurant and certainly won't be recommending it to anyone."

During my recent visit to this location, my family and I were met with a less-than-stellar experience. Despite being loyal customers to this company, we were treated with a lack of respect and courtesy by the cashier at the customer service desk. We were unaware that the store was closing early for New Year's Day, and while checking out with an exchange, we were met with snappy attitude and impatience from the employee.

To make matters worse, when I couldn't locate my 20% off coupon, the cashier was quick to dismiss me and insist I bring it back at a later time. It was clear that she had no interest in assisting us and was more focused on getting out of there as soon as possible. As a regular spender at this store, I was disappointed by the lack of professionalism and customer service displayed.

While I understand the desire to close up shop and go home, that should not be an excuse to treat paying customers with such disrespect. I would caution others to approach this location with some hesitation, as not all employees seem to prioritize providing a pleasant shopping experience. My family and I will likely reconsider returning to this location in the future."

I've had the displeasure of dining at V.Picasso on three separate occasions, and sadly, each visit was a disappointment. The food was lackluster and the service was abysmal. One particular experience stands out in my mind - on a late Friday night when the bar was nearly empty, I waited several minutes for my server to come take my drink order. When I finally did order a 12oz beer, I was surprised to see on my bill that I was charged for a 23oz beer. When I brought this to the attention of my server and showed him my half-empty glass, he just stared blankly at me before declaring that the charge was correct. Talk about customer service! Needless to say, I will not be returning to V.Picasso anytime soon. Save your money and go elsewhere for a better dining experience."
461,"The hotel was nice however it's not worth the price per night in my opinion. \nWe requested a non-smoking room and all night I smelled cigarette smoke, I'm guessing coming through one of the vents. It was nasty and I didn't want to reek of cigarettes. \nBeautiful water fountain show and elegant decor inside.\nHowever, it's highly overrated."
462,"Invited friends to dinner and drinks there, as we had been there before and enjoyed the experience.  This time, not so much. Arrived with a party of four, and was seated at a table that was too close to the next table on one side (making it hard to get in and out of our seats)' the other side backed to the walkway to the kitchen, making our guest uncomfortable with all the traffic behind them. This was done, even though there were at least 5 or 6 open tables that did not have this issue.\n\nThe appetizers were delivered promptly and were good quality (meat and cheese board with olives) though a bit pricey.  Drinks were ordered, and when I ordered ice tea, was told that they charge for EACH GLASS. I asked about this and was given a lame excuse by the waitress that it is because they brew it by the glass. Later when the Manager delivered some of the food, I questioned this policy stating that this was the only place in AZ that I knew that charged for ice tea by the glass. She gave the same reason and when I stated that it surely did not cost $2.50 to brew more tea, she got defensive and said that \""This is A WINE BAR YOU KNOW\"" \""We don't sell much ice tea.\"" I replied \""No doubt at those prices\"" and asked if she ever heard of the \""Designated Driver\"" that could should not be drinking. She gave no reply and left.\n\nThe food was only fair, I had the shrimp in pasta and cream sauce. The shrimp were large, but the pasta was too dry with only a coating of sauce.  My wife (a vegetarian) ordered the Mac and Cheese and the arugula orange salad. The salad was nothing special. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese had ham in it, even though it is not listed on the menu. Thus, half of her dinner could not be eaten by her. I tried it. The Mac and cheese was bland with little flavor and again, way too dry.\n\nWhile our friends did not have any issues, they only ate half their meals. Probably too polite to express disappointment to us on our pick for dinner.\n\nThe service  was not timely, had to ask twice for water, because the server forgot, she even stated when asked for the second time, \""Oh I did not know you wanted water\""\n\nAll in all, mediocre and way too pricey for what you get. Probably ok if all you want to do is drink wine and an appetizers, don't bother for dinner.  Was hoping it would be better, but either the Living Room or Postinos have much better service and food for the same cost."
463,"This place was AWFUL. I was using the groupon so I had to call to make a reservation for my friend and I. As soon as I told the receptionist that I would be using the groupon, she tried to hang up on me. I told her she hadn't asked for my name yet, and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise, she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much? She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would \""look bad\"". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. \n\nWhen she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, \""Oh my God\"" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails. We would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon. This was the worst nail experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO TO MAGEN NAIL."
464,"We stopped by this location around 9:25 pm, for a light meal. We ordered one sandwich, an order or fries, popcorn chicken, and ice cream. We sat talking in the car for awhile, and around 9:40 we realized it had been quite a long time. No one came to talk to us or even to take our money until 10 pm. That's right, it took over half an hour for four items. When we received our food, it was cold and the fries were half full. I asked the server to at least bring us some hot food as we had been waiting almost 40 minutes. All she offered was an apology and my ice cream (with no spoon) while she ran back for hot food. I expected at least more acknowledgment of our inconvenience, something. This was the most ridiculous service I've ever had, and having worked fast food for 8 years I feel that I am very understanding about mishaps and service problems. I will never return here."
465,"Stayed here 3/6/12-3/8/12\n\nGot the room comped, 1st time staying here. NASCAR was in town this Sunday and it was a long line to check in.  I say roughly 40-50 people in line and about 5-7 people working the front desk.  Our room was at the Habitat Tower so it was a long ways to get to.  Rooms were decent but the beds were not \""Queen\"" sized.  More like Full.  Dont think we stayed in an updated room.  The good things are that it was smack in the middle of the strip.  Walking distance to everything.  And at time of check out they have kiosks for express check out on the right.  I think it was a manager who helped me check out.  Very patient white man, being I never tried the kiosk check out.  I like more of the piece and quiet type of place so definetely not staying here next time.  I will for sure stay at my Time Share at the Cancun Resort South of the strip.  Very peaceful and super friendly staff.  If you are the party type I would recommend this place."
466,"I like the vibe and the burgers here.  The took away my favorite beer (a rasberry lambic style), but I can understand that something like that is not to everyone's taste!  The only real complaint that I have is that one of the hostesses needs an attitude adjustment.  I went in a couple weeks ago with a dear friend visiting from out of town and wanted to bring her to BrGr for a quick welcome drink when she arrived.  We arrived around 4pm on a weekday, when the place was virtually empty, and asked to sit on the couches (again, the whole area was empty) and the hostess curtly refused to seat us there on the grounds that we weren't eating.  It is my experience that the best way to handle policies like this is to say to the customer that they are welcome to sit where they would like as long as the place is empty, but that if a large table comes in they will have to move.  After all, we just wanted a quick drink and, based on my experience of the place, would have been out before the rush.  In any case, what was a pretty good opinion of the restaurant was seriously soured by this experience.  The hostess wasn't even apologetic, she was off-putting and generally seemed like her decision was based on power and pride, not care for the customer or the business."
467," But let me not end on a bad note

On my recent visit, I decided to try this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation. The ambience was nice, with dim lighting and a cozy atmosphere. My boyfriend and I had decided to go for happy hour and were looking forward to trying out their famous burgers. However, upon entering, we were met with unwelcoming and uninterested staff. It took forever to get their attention, and even then, they seemed annoyed by our presence. We brushed it off and placed our order, hoping the food would make up for the lackluster service.

Sadly, we were disappointed once again. While the truffle fries were delicious and the presentation was unique, the rest of the food was just average. My burger fell apart as soon as I picked it up, and the zucchini fries tasted like they were straight out of a frozen bag. For the price, we were expecting much more. It would have been helpful if our server had given us some suggestions on how to pair the ingredients or at least warned us about the crumbling patty.

The only redeeming factor was the happy hour specials and wine list, both of which offered a good deal. However, it's a shame that such potential is being overshadowed by the subpar service and mediocre food. Maybe if the staff were friendlier and put in some effort, it would make the whole experience more enjoyable. As it stands, we probably won't be returning anytime soon. But hey, maybe with some changes, this place could be worth trying again."
468,"What's a good way to start Saturday Morning in Las Vegas....Bagels and Starbucks! \n\nThe breakfast bagels came with cream cheese and we probably got about a dozen bagels. The bagels were tasty, definitely a little hard on the outside but still good. \n\nGot the bagels and headed to the Starbucks drive though :)"

The food at this restaurant was certainly top-notch, but unfortunately, that wasn't enough to make up for the underwhelming service we experienced. My husband was particularly unimpressed, and as the one who pays the bill, his opinion definitely counts for something. Our waiter was friendly, but it seemed like he was having a hard time keeping track of our orders. My husband had requested a salad before his meal, but it ended up being forgotten and brought out with his main course. And to add insult to injury, it was overcooked and not enjoyable at all. We had to flag down our waiter multiple times throughout the evening just to get the basics, and even our bill took forever to arrive. Keep in mind, this was a quiet Monday night with very few customers. Despite these shortcomings, the food was delicious enough to make us consider giving this place another chance. Just make sure to keep a close eye on the service and don't expect to leave full if you're planning to indulge in their famous cheesecake."

My recent experience at The Rokerij was far from enjoyable. Despite the rave reviews, I was disappointed to find that they were not accommodating to my vegetarian diet. I had read online that the quesadilla explosion salad was a fan favorite, so I eagerly ordered it without the chicken. Imagine my surprise when the server loudly pointed out that it was not considered an entree and therefore, I couldn't use my coupon. I was not looking for an argument, but the server became belligerent and made me feel cheap in front of my date and the other patrons. It was a major mood killer and I left feeling embarrassed and frustrated. As someone who values a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, I will not be returning to The Rokerij. Ladies, take note - there are plenty of other restaurants that provide great food and service without making their customers feel uncomfortable. "

Upon walking into this establishment, I could already feel a negative energy emanating from the front counter. The man working there seemed completely disinterested in providing any sort of decent service. We were told that the work on our car would be done in 90 minutes, but it ended up taking over two hours! And when the guy finally came out to check on our battery, he took another 90 minutes just to do that. Talk about a waste of time! And the cherry on top of this horrible experience? They charged us $20 just for the battery check and service. Are you kidding me? As if our time wasn't already wasted, now we're being scammed for extra money. But wait, it gets worse. We were told our battery needed to be replaced, but when we took our car to a different auto shop, they found that the battery was actually in perfect condition. The real issue was with the starter assembly, which we replaced for a fraction of the cost that Sears had quoted us. Needless to say, we will never be returning to this place and I highly suggest you stay far away as well. These people are nothing but cheats and scammers, and it's a shame that they are still in business. Save your time, money, and sanity and go elsewhere. Trust me, you'll thank me later."

This cab company is a complete nightmare. I booked a cab in advance for an early morning flight, and was promised a discounted rate. However, when the time came, the cab never showed up. I called the dispatch multiple times and each time was told that the cab was ""10 minutes away"". After 15 minutes, I finally decided to call a different cab company and they arrived immediately, charging a lower fare than this unreliable company promised. To make matters worse, the woman on the phone sounded completely out of it, like she was on drugs. It's a good thing I switched companies or I would have missed my flight. Do yourself a favor and avoid this cab company at all costs. They are not only unreliable, but overpriced and potentially dangerous if the person answering the phone is not in the right state of mind. Trust me, it's not worth the hassle. Use another company and save yourself the stress and potential disaster."

I recently visited this ice cream shop with my family and our experience was just okay. The service was fast, which was a plus, but the prices were pretty standard compared to other ice cream places in the area. My kids enjoyed their Italian ice, but I have to say, I wasn't too impressed with the custard. While it was super creamy, it just didn't have that wow factor for me. One downside of the shop is that there is no indoor seating and it's quite small, so if you visit during the peak of summer, be prepared to eat your treats in the car like we did. Overall, it was an average experience."
475,"This hotel gets 3 stars. If you are expecting a luxurious hotel, this is not the place to stay. Book a room at the Mirage for that. They have much nicer rooms for the same price.

This club definitely lived up to its reputation as a fun and exciting spot in the city. My boyfriend and I were looking for something different to do for the night and we were pleasantly surprised by our experience here. The small size of the club was not an issue at all, as there were plenty of seats and gorgeous girls with amazing bodies to keep us entertained. As someone who has been trying to convince my boyfriend to go to a strip club with me for a while, I couldn't have asked for a better night. And now, he can't wait to go back! The dancers were not only beautiful, but also friendly and receptive to our enthusiastic cheers and shouts. The atmosphere was playful and non-judgmental, which made us feel comfortable and relaxed. We had an amazing time and we'll definitely be coming back for more. Thank you to all the lovely and adventurous dancers who made our night one to remember!"

482,"Let me start out by saying that I know many people who LOVE this place and frequent it on a regular basis.  Also, I have worked in a restaurant for the majority of my life (serving, bartending, managing...) so what I am about to say is no exaggeration.  That being said, why does it seem that every time I go there I feel like I walk in with a giant stamp on my forehead reading \""PLEASE IGNORE ME AND GIVE ME TERRIBLE SERVICE\""?????????  \n\nEvery time it takes about 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10-15 to get our drinks (even while sitting at the bar)!   Last time my fianc\u00e9 and I bellied up to the bar the bartender didn't even make contact with us for 15 minutes because he was too busy bragging about that he is the \""best bartender in the world\""- I kid you not!  It was obvious that there were several regulars at the bar, but a bartender needs to know how to schmooze them and pour drinks for others at the same time.  I honestly don't think that guy could walk and chew gum at the same time :-/\n\nNext, when we have actually hung around long enough to get food, it hasn't been that great.  The pancakes tasted like they are the frozen kind you pop in the microwave, the carne asada and eggs dish was sooooooooo greasy we ate about 2 bites, and the bruschetta was bland and the bread tasted like it has fake smoke seasoning on it- which needless to say was totally weird!  \n\nI feel like my family and I have just had bad experiences at BLD and as mentioned above, many people I know love this place!

The ambiance of this place definitely left a lot to be desired. As soon as we walked in, everyone stopped talking and turned to look at us. Talk about uncomfortable. And the decor? Let's just say it was straight out of the 70s and not in a trendy way. If you're a regular, I'm sure this is your spot, but for us newcomers, it was a bit too much. The menu had some interesting options and we decided to go for the grilled cheese and chicken salad sandwich. While the grilled cheese was decent, the lack of flavor in the soup was a huge letdown. And the chicken salad? Let's just say it was the biggest disappointment of the meal. The dressing was what saved it, otherwise it was just a messy, unappetizing sandwich. To top it all off, the service was surprisingly quick but not very friendly. Maybe it was because we were there during the workweek, but I couldn't help feeling like we were bothering them. The one redeeming quality was their diverse beer selection, but at that point, we were just ready to leave. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're a regular or enjoy feeling like an outsider in your own neighborhood."
484,"Ooh, Roosevelt.\n\nThe Good:  They have an awesome selection of beers.  Also, the conversion of an old house into a bar is pretty fun.\n\nThe Bad:  Lighting- on what planet do you require a cell phone to read a menu??  Seriously, I know that I can act like an old lady sometimes, but I shouldn't have to squint to see what's available.  Service- the bartender was actually awesome.  The \""servers\""...I am not sure why they are even there.  There were two gals, and one of them took my initial order for a beer and every few minutes they would walk back into the room, but not once did they ask me or any of the other 3 people I was sitting with if we needed another.  Even though the bar was almost empty.  I had to walk to the bar to order a pretzel (which was delicious), and also walk to the bar to close out my tab.  If the service was better, heck ,even acceptable, I'd probably be giving this review 4 stars."

Pros:
- Convenient location, especially for a quick bite before an event.
- Good value for the soup and drink combo.
- Convenient to have both savory and sweet options.
- Cozy atmosphere with casual seating and friendly staff.

Cons:
- Sandwich was average and had more bread than meat.
- Soup portion was small, almost like a Dixie Cup size.
- Lack of freshness in the food.
- Limited options for lunch or dinner.

Although I was disappointed with my recent experience at this restaurant, I will still come back for breakfast since their pastries have never disappointed me. However, for lunch or dinner, I will probably stick to other options in the area. Overall, the restaurant has potential but needs improvement in their lunch/dinner menu. "

487,"After experiencing more misses than hits here in the past 6 months, I've decided to downgrade my stars from 3 to 2. It's just not very good, and whoever is in the kitchen doesn't understand Vietnamese cuisine at all. I have it from an inside source that they're having difficulty finding trainable staff, and there really doesn't seem to be anyone at the helm here. My lunch today of rice vermicelli with chicken, a dish I've had here dozens of times,  was almost inedible. I mean, it's hard to overcook dark meat from a chicken to the extent that was served up to me today...you've gotta work at it. I suspect that, as business is slow, food is not being prepared to order, but being pre cooked and held; it has that taste to it. The rice noodles themselves had definitely been precooked, and probably been held for longer than a day, as they tasted of refrigerator. Yuck. No more will I be bringing my business here."
488,"hmmmm. Undecided. On the plus side sweet service and pretty nice, clean, tasty food. Cold tofu was good, and variety of rolls all pretty yummy. We were two of four customers, so ambiance waivered between low to non-existent, which is a shame 'cos I really want tiny, holes-in-the wall that do good food to thrive. Decor is a bit tired, and needs a good clean. Ambivalent about returning, hence the 3 star review."

The warm walnut bread with honey was AMAZING and we even requested more.\n\nStarted the meal with the beet salad and crab beignets and it was just meh. Really didn't have any flavor and wasn't impressed. The crab beignets also were like deep fried crab cakes and not beignets. It didn't do much for me in terms of flavor or taste.\n\nThe main dishes were the portabello mushrooms flatbread and the salmon trio. The flatbread was probably the best thing we ate (except the warm walnut bread rolls...drool...) and you could taste the truffle oil on it too. If you're going to eat there, I'd highly recommend that you order a flat bread.\n\nThe salmon trio was a seared salmon, salmon cake, and salmon tabouli. The seared salmon wasn't anything special but i did appreciate they didn't overcook it. I thought the salmon cake was interesting and probably my favorite of the three. The tabouli wasn't memorable. Not worth $36.\n\nEnded the meal with a vanilla souffle and taste-wise it was fine but the consistency was off. My expectations of a souffle at a Mediterranean restaurant were also not high.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant atmosphere and our waitress was great. I just didn't think the food was really worth the prices and I would not go back again if I was in Vegas."
490,I am sick to my stomach!!  I just had a bug on the lemon in my water.

I visited this restaurant with some friends after hearing about its delicious food. And I have to say, the food definitely lived up to the hype! The flavors and presentation were on point and we were all thoroughly satisfied with our meals. However, our server completely ruined the experience for us. He seemed to be preoccupied and forgot some of our orders, making us wait even longer for our food. Additionally, it took forever for someone to even give us menus and we had to ask for water multiple times. But the icing on the cake was when they took away our condiments while we were still using them. Talk about lack of attention to detail! And to make matters worse, they took forever to give us our checks, even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all.

It's truly disappointing when a great dining experience is overshadowed by terrible service. And unfortunately, this seems to be a recurring theme at this restaurant. The food is definitely worth trying, but is it worth the hassle and frustration of dealing with poor service? I'm not so sure. As much as I enjoy the food here, I don't know if I'll be back anytime soon due to the unreliable and inattentive staff. So if you do decide to give this place a try, just be prepared for a potentially unpleasant dining experience."

Service was not up to par at this place, which is a shame because the food and hospitality had so much potential. My sister and I had made reservations and arrived with high expectations. However, the hostess didn't even greet us when we approached her and asked us to wait for our table. Meanwhile, another couple who also had reservations were seated before us. When we were finally seated, we were placed outside next to a large and loud group. Our server lacked any kind of warmth or friendliness, and his sarcasm was off-putting. Our food was average, but the dessert was a standout - salted caramel white hot chocolate in a hug mug. However, our server seemed to neglect our dessert order and when we tried to get his attention, he was dismissive and unapologetic. It was also disappointing to find that my utensils were dirty and the server's reaction was to blame my boyfriend. Overall, while the hot chocolate was excellent, the subpar service and lackluster food unfortunately overshadowed the good aspects of this place. "
493,"I'm sorry but you should NEVER have to wait over an hour in the waiting room and then wait more once you're finally in the room! It takes forever to get an appointment with your doctor. The doctor just kept telling me I needed the right cocktail of meds for my migraines even though I've tried just about everything. She had no interest in what I had to say and questioned everything I said, and not in a good way. I'm not sure who they treat but it's not patients! BTW- I experienced the wait time over 3 times I went there. I thought maybe it was just a bad day that first visit but it wasn't."

Here's why:

So I recently visited this chocolate shop on a chilly January day. And let me tell you, the chocolates looked absolutely divine. I couldn't resist the urge to take a picture, but of course, I needed that perfect lighting. So there I was, sitting on a snow-covered bench, trying to get the perfect shot while the wind was howling around me. And to make matters worse, the shop is located in the middle of a busy outdoor mall, so people were definitely giving me some strange looks. But, I was determined to get that picture. 

But then, disaster struck. A sudden gust of wind came out of nowhere and sent my precious chocolate flying into a snowbank. It was a heartbreaking moment. But, I didn't let that stop me. I mean, I still wanted that picture and a taste of that delicious-looking truffle. So I dug through that pile of snow, trying to find my truffle, and finally got my hands on it. I took the picture, took a bite, and...it was just okay. 

Maybe it was because of the snow it landed in, but the taste was just underwhelming. And for the price I paid, I was expecting something much better. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, or maybe I'm just not a fan of their chocolates. But for now, I'll stick to my tried and true chocolate shops. "

Overall, I was very disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. While the initial service seemed welcoming, the quality quickly declined after we signed up for the rental agreement. The staff became rude and disinterested, and it was clear that we were no longer important to them. On top of that, the apartment was filled with issues from the very beginning. The maintenance was poor, with broken appliances and constant leaks. And to make matters worse, my laundry room door provided a front-row seat to my neighbor's house. It's disheartening that this place has no regard for its tenants. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for. This is definitely not worth the money, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere."
496,"I can't rate the experience because I didn't really get one. Here is what I can rate: \n\nI went to try H.B. for the first time on Monday (3/25). When I got there, they took my name and the host said 10 minutes. I came back 15 minutes later, and the same host said another 10 minutes. I came back 10 minutes later and a hostess said I still had 2 names ahead of mine and she apologizes \""we are waiting for the servers to catch up\""\n\nI looked inside and there were plenty of seats. I said \""why not bring people off the curb and offer them drinks at least.\"" To which she replied \""sorry, just what my manager said\""\n\nSo I called Citizen Public House and they prepared a table for me on the spot. (IT WAS MONDAY) I won't be trying again. Figured I would mention it, as it could have been easily correctable: \""hey can we get you a drink at the bar while you wait\"" or \""Hey my apologies, we are very understaffed, can we seat you and offer you a beverage\"""

I was excited to try this Chinese restaurant for the first time, and I wanted to start with a classic dish - fried rice. But my experience was anything but enjoyable. The rice was overpriced and tasted like it had been sitting out for days. The meat was tough and full of fat. And the service was subpar, with the staff rushing me through my meal despite the fact that the place was empty. On top of all of that, I was charged extra for the rice, which was already mediocre at best. I would not recommend wasting your money on this overhyped and underwhelming restaurant. Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else for your Chinese food fix."

The ambiance at Ghost Bar was still as chic and trendy as ever, but my recent experience there was a bit underwhelming. The staff were friendly and attentive, as always, and the view of the city was still stunning. But what really put a damper on my night was the steep cover charge and even more expensive drinks. I understand that it's a popular spot, but $30 just to get in the door is a bit much. And when I finally got my drink, I couldn't help but be disappointed by the steep price tag. But the real disappointment came when I saw a sign at the cashier that dancing was prohibited. I was so looking forward to getting my groove on, but it turns out Ghost Bar is more of a lounge than a dance club. Talk about a mood killer. All in all, I can see why people love this place for its atmosphere and city views, but for me, the high cost and lack of dance floor really put a damper on the experience."
499,Ate here again when back in Vegas and I must say I'm so embarrassed I took my mom here! I don't know what happened since our last visit here but it was awful this time and we won't be going back! Too bad we will just have to find another sushi spot when we visit Vegas.

New place, located in the heart of Montreal. Unforgettable experience with delicious food, top-notch service, and excellent pricing. Les Deux Gamins is a hidden gem amongst the bustling restaurants in the area.

My boyfriend and I were warmly greeted and seated comfortably by the friendly staff. We decided to share the Planche mixte/Assorted Charcuterie and cheese, an ample portion for two. The bread served with it was warm and fresh.

I ordered the B≈ìuf Bourguignon/Beef Bourguignon and was blown away by the flavor and tenderness of the meat. My boyfriend chose the Filet mignon sauce foie gras, pommes de terre foresti√®res and he savored every last bite.

Even though I was stuffed from my main course, I couldn't resist trying a bite of my boyfriend's Chocolat lava cake with caramel ice cream. It was simply divine and left me wanting more.

The wine list was impressive and reasonably priced, adding to the overall wonderful dining experience at Les Deux Gamins.

While the food and service were exceptional, the only downside of our evening was the noise level. It would have been a perfect night if it weren't for the overly loud music. It was quite distracting and made it difficult to have a conversation without yelling.

Overall, Les Deux Gamins is a must-try for anyone looking for excellent home-cooked French cuisine at an affordable price. I can see why it has become a staple in Montreal and I can't wait to come back and try more of their delectable dishes. Bon app√©tit!"

I had been wanting to try out this place for a while, and finally got the chance to go. While the price was definitely a draw, the quality and taste did not live up to my expectations. We ordered a pound of Dungeness Crab, King Crab, Snow Crab, and clams, but it seemed like the only thing that was close to a pound was the clams. The rest of the crab was significantly smaller than expected. Plus, a few of the king crab legs were overcooked, making it difficult to get the meat out. For the price we paid for a pound of crab, this was definitely frustrating.

But the real issue came with the service. Our waitress seemed rushed and disinterested in our questions. We didn't even get a chance to fully enjoy our meals because she brought the check before we were even finished. Not to mention, the whole place reeks of garlic and we definitely smelled like it for the next 24 hours. Not exactly the most pleasant experience.

And just like the other review, I also felt like the conversation kept going back to organic food. I'm here for a seafood feast, not a lecture on healthy eating. Speaking of which, the flavors were good but nothing spectacular. I've had better tasting seafood elsewhere.

Overall, I had a decent experience at this place but it just didn't live up to my expectations. For the price, I would rather go to a different seafood joint and get better quality and taste. And I definitely won't be recommending this place to others anytime soon."

We had a girls night out at Max Brenner and decided to try out their famous desserts. First of all, the smell when we walked in was absolutely amazing. It was so tempting, we couldn't wait to dig in! The wait for our desserts was a little long, but we didn't mind as we were enjoying the cozy atmosphere and catching up with each other. Plus, it just made the desserts taste even better when they finally arrived.

We ordered a variety of treats to share and we were not disappointed. The Max Brenner pizza with ""the works"" was an interesting and unique twist on pizza, but the crust was a bit too thick for our liking. We ended up scraping off the toppings and enjoying them on their own. The peanut butter and chocolate sundae was by far our favorite, with the perfect balance of creamy peanut butter and rich chocolate. And let's not forget about the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache and ice cream, served with a chocolate shot on the side. Indulgence at its finest.

However, we did notice that the staff seemed a little too eager to clear our plates, making us feel a bit rushed. But with such delicious desserts, we can understand the temptation. We also noticed that almost every table around us had ordered the fondue, making us wish we had tried it as well. Maybe next time, because there's no doubt we will be back. Despite the rushed service, the friendly staff and incredible desserts make this place a must-visit for any sweet tooth."

I had high hopes for this dry cleaning business, as it is conveniently located near my home. However, my experience has been consistently underwhelming. Despite their recent remodel, the place still lacks a welcoming atmosphere. The only thing that seemed to be put together was the decor. \n\nAt first, I appreciated the quick service when our chips and salsa were brought to the table promptly. But, the taste was just not there. My wife requested extra hot salsa, but it came out lukewarm and lacked any real flavor. The fish tacos were a disappointment as well, with a measly portion of fish that barely filled the taco. And the lack of flavor made me question if they were even trying. \n\nAs for my carne asada burrito, let's just say it was not worth the price. The tortilla was thick and tasted more like a doughy paste than anything remotely enjoyable. And the amount of carne asada was so minuscule, it was almost non-existent in the burrito. The beans were lukewarm, which was surprising since the plate was scorching hot. \n\nTo top it off, my wife requested more chips and they never made it to our table. Throughout the entire meal, we were never checked on or asked if we were satisfied with our meal. But I am sure our half-eaten plates spoke volumes. Despite it being a Saturday evening, the restaurant was only at about 30-40% occupancy. I can see why. \n\nAfter three disappointing visits, I have given up on this place. They do not have  the friendliest service, and the prices do not justify the mediocre quality. Even my generous two stars may be too kind."
505,"Sadly this is the only good Fry's near my house which I occasionally frequent if I don't make the trek to Mesa or Chandler for grocery shopping. I don't know, something about going into a store that regularly has two security officers makes me feel like I am heading into a prison or something. I always feel like there are eyes on me or something, creepy. The store itself is pretty nice, small selection on the organic though, and the evenings are pretty slow. It is located in a strip mall to get all your shopping done all in one spot: Gamestop, Target, restaurants, Great Clips, ACE, Anna's, Ross, etc."
506,"This place is horrible since the owner changed to Food Express! The prices have risen since then. I would understand if the food was outstanding or if it was an upscale restaurant, but please, its nowhere close. The food quality has degraded to levels worst than I can describe. The food that came out was so cold and tasteless we couldn't even eat it. The waiters and including the manager treated us like 3rd class citizens. These people even charged us $1.50 per bowl of rice. We had to remind them 3 times before they even delivered it to us. Our dishes all came out before our rice was even served. They used to give you hot dessert after your meal, but not anymore. I would advise not to come here even if you were playing table games, if they comp you or give you half off. You're better off driving to Chinatown and going to HK Star for a authentic and worthwhile experience. This place ruined our night."

A group of us decided to try out Great Wall for dim sum after hearing good things about it. We were excited to try out the dishes featured on Bizarre, and I had high expectations after being recommended this place.

To be fair, we did arrive towards the end of the rush on a busy Sunday afternoon, so we knew not everything would still be available. However, we were disappointed when only two carts came around with leftovers from the rush. The quality of the dishes was just okay, with some being quite bland and others being overly salty. The chicken feet, which I usually love, were prepared in a different style that did not sit well with my stomach.

Perhaps if we had arrived earlier, we would have received better service and fresher dishes. But flagging down the carts constantly was a bit stressful and took away from our dining experience. I think I will stick with my usual dim sum place in the future."

During our recent stay at the Luxor Hotel, we had high hopes for a memorable and enjoyable experience. However, it seems that our expectations were not entirely met. While the staff were friendly and helpful, the overall quality of the amenities and services left much to be desired.

To start off, the mandatory resort fee was a disappointment. Despite paying for this added expense, we were surprised to find that the hotel did not offer WiFi for their guests. In today's digital age, this seems like a basic necessity and we were disappointed to have to pay extra for it.

Additionally, the lack of a coffee maker in the room and the inflated prices at the on-site Starbucks were a letdown. We also found the pool to have limited operating hours, closing at 6pm during our stay. And don't even get me started on the buffet - easily the worst we have ever experienced.

On the plus side, the Ancient Egyptian theme was definitely a unique and fun aspect of the hotel. And while the location at the end of the strip was not ideal, the easy connections to neighboring hotels were convenient.

All in all, our trip to the Luxor was underwhelming. While our room was clean and spacious, the lack of basic amenities and subpar services left us feeling somewhat disappointed. At the end of the day, we didn't feel that the added expenses were worth it. Perhaps with some improvements, the Luxor could live up to its potential, but for now, we will be exploring other options for our next trip to Vegas."

That being said their prices are actually higher than the best places (Grimaldis, Spinatos, Quattro al Formagio, Humble pie, Pomo , Grazi, Bianco, The Cove). So - I recommend NYPD if you are really hungry for Pizza and can't get to one of these other places, or for home delivery - and look for a coupon."

I must say, my experience at this Monorail station stop was a bit of a mixed bag. Let me explain. The rooms are quite nice and I've been lucky enough to snag some amazing deals here, including a 1,000 square foot room for just $150 a night. Score! However, the service definitely left something to be desired.

My sister and I arrived early, but we were informed that our room was not yet ready, which was understandable. So we headed to the casino to pass the time. Around 3pm, we returned to the reservation desk to check-in. But to our disappointment, we were met with an unhelpful staff member who couldn't give us an estimated wait time. Frustrating, but we decided to just wait it out.

However, things only got worse when we encountered the manager. She seemed bothered by our request for an update and eventually just gave us the keys to a different suite, making it seem like it was our choice to stay in a room that wasn't yet ready. Talk about passing the blame. But I have to admit, upon arriving in the room, I was blown away. The space was huge - a parlor room connected to a separate bedroom and hotel room. It definitely made up for the lackluster service.

Overall, I have to give this place 3 stars. The room was great, but the service definitely needs improvement. I've stayed here multiple times, but I would probably consider other options if I could find a better deal."

Our experience with the monorail was extremely disappointing. After a long day of exploring the strip, we were excited to hop on the monorail for a quick and convenient ride back to our hotel. However, we were met with unhelpful and uninterested staff at the ticket booth. When we asked about pricing and options, the employee seemed annoyed and unenthusiastic to assist us. We ended up paying for a day pass, but the lack of customer service left a bad taste in our mouths. \n\nTo make matters worse, the monorail itself was dirty and outdated. The seats were worn and uncomfortable, and there was trash scattered throughout the train. It was definitely not the luxury mode of transportation that we were hoping for. \n\nOverall, we were extremely disappointed with our experience on the monorail.

This studio may seem inviting, but don't let that fool you. I've been practicing here for over a year, and I can honestly say it's been a struggle. The heat can be intimidating, but it's nothing compared to the disappointment I feel after each class. The instructors may seem welcoming, but they clearly have their favorites and I'm not one of them. Whenever I'm not up to par with my practice, I feel all eyes on me, as if I'm not good enough to be there. And don't even get me started on the pricing. Sure, they offer discounts to teachers and public service workers, but those of us who don't fall into those categories are left paying full price for a less-than-satisfying experience. And don't even think about showing up on a bad day, because this place just won't cut it. The only thing that keeps me going back is the hope that one day, I'll actually feel welcomed and included in this studio.

When we finally did get our barely edible food, it was clear that no care or effort had been put into it. The only highlight of the evening was the talented musicians playing their hearts out on the dueling pianos. But even their talent couldn't make up for the terrible overall experience.

I stopped by this charity shop in hopes of finding some hidden gems among the sea of donated items. However, my experience quickly turned sour when I encountered the rudest staff member I have ever encountered. I approached the counter to inquire about a faulty DVD I purchased and the person, who identified himself as Steve, responded with nothing but condescending remarks and a dismissive attitude. Despite my attempts to reason with him and request a refund, he simply shrugged and said ""Well, that's the risk you take with secondhand products."" \n\nI couldn't believe the lack of professionalism and basic customer service skills displayed by someone in a managerial position. When I asked to speak with his supervisor, he smugly informed me that he is in fact the ""post master general"" and hung up on me.

Not only was I unable to get a functioning product, but I also left feeling disrespected and frustrated. Give this place a pass and save yourself the hassle.

520,"I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.\n\nThe servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!\n\nNow for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).\n\nStrike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!\n\nIf you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!"

The atmosphere of this restaurant really stood out to me - the three-story interior is impressive and the outdoor patio was a nice touch. I also appreciated the large selection of beers on tap, it's clear they take their brews seriously. 

However, I have to say, my experience was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the prices were very reasonable and the cornbread was delicious. But the main event - the food - was just decent. It was nothing special and didn't quite live up to the hype. Additionally, the service left something to be desired. Even though it was busy, the staff seemed slow and disorganized. 

The slow service was particularly frustrating when it came time to order. Our bartender took our drink order and then walked away twice to serve other customers before coming back to take our food order. And to top it off, she seemed to be having a bad day and kept complaining about it to another employee. Not a great first impression. 

Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the prices were fair, but the so-so food and service make me hesitant to return. Maybe next time I'll just stick to trying all 50 beers on tap and skip the food altogether. "

I stopped by this new popsicle shop in downtown Tempe with high expectations after hearing about their unique flavors. I was excited to try the lemon one, as I love sour flavors, and it did not disappoint. However, I also got the pecan one which lacked any real taste. Disappointing, to say the least. But what truly ruined my experience was the parking situation. I had to pay $5 just to stop in and grab these popsicles. Absolutely ridiculous. And since I don't frequent Tempe often, I didn't realize how much they love to overcharge for parking. My wallet and I definitely won't be returning anytime soon. It's a shame that this shop's location and lackluster flavor choices overshadowed the one good popsicle I had. Maybe they should focus on improving their flavors and customer experience instead of relying on expensive parking fees. Until then, I'll be exploring other dessert options in the area. "

My friends and I stopped by this counter service restaurant for a quick bite after catching a movie. The variety of pizza slices was impressive, and they also offered salads and pastas. The few tables they had were well-kept and we appreciated the self-service soda station.

However, the experience took a turn for the worse when we tried to order. It took quite a while for the person behind the counter to acknowledge us and take our order. And even though the food was good, some of my friends never received their order. We had to flag down the person again and found out they had forgotten to turn it in. No apologies or compensation were offered, which left a sour taste in our mouths.

While the pizza itself was pretty good, I personally prefer a thicker crust. The sign said it was Brooklyn style, but I didn't really get that vibe. Overall, it was just average and not worth the hassle and lack of service. We ended up spending over $100 and had to chase down the person again to pay the bill. Not exactly the experience we were hoping for. Maybe it's better for takeout or for a quick lunch, but I don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon."

I've been a regular at this restaurant for years, and unfortunately, my experience has been hit or miss. I always make sure to double-check my order before leaving the drive-up because more often than not, it's not what I asked for. And let me tell you, it's quite frustrating to have to open up the bag, unwrap my burrito, and peel back the tortilla just to make sure they got it right. And even then, they still manage to mess it up 90% of the time. It's such a shame because their food is actually really good and affordable. But after countless incorrect orders, I've had enough.

One time, I made the mistake of not checking my order before heading home, and of course, it was wrong. So I drove all the way back, and they made it again for me. But can you believe it, they still got it wrong! How hard is it to make a simple burrito with just carne asada and cheese? Apparently, it's rocket science for Armandos.

On top of the constant mistakes, the location is also a major issue. Not only is it in a dangerous area where panhandlers approach you while you wait in your car, but the drive-up can also be chaotic and stressful. I understand that it's a small business, but with the amount of food they must throw away due to incorrect orders, you'd think they would make more of an effort to get it right. But sadly, that's not the case.

I used to love coming here for their tasty food, but the constant disappointments and frustrations have turned me into an ex-customer. It's just not worth the hassle and risk anymore. Armandos, please get your act together and stop screwing up my burritos."

First time visiting this buffet and unfortunately, I left feeling underwhelmed. As someone who values good customer service, I was disappointed by the attitude of the staff. The server seemed bothered when I asked for a refill on my champagne and didn't even acknowledge me when I had to go back and ask for my missing drink. Maybe it was because I had my 10 month old daughter with me, but that's no excuse for poor service.

As for the food, it was just okay. The smoked salmon and cod were the standout dishes, but the rest of the spread left much to be desired. Unfortunately, the wait to even get inside the buffet area was incredibly long, but thankfully the line moved quickly. However, there were no crab or oysters in sight, which was a let down. And don't even get me started on the subpar ice cream and lackluster desserts.

While it may be in the heart of Vegas, I was hoping for a bit more ambiance at the Bellagio. The atmosphere felt sterile and unwelcoming. Overall, just a mediocre experience. Perhaps I'll try a different dining option next time I'm at the Bellagio."

Disappointing service experience.\n\nWhile I have enjoyed the food in the past, my recent visit was tainted by the lack of attention from our server. Despite our table being one of the few occupied in the cozy family restaurant, our server seemed more interested in her phone than taking our orders. When our food finally came out, we were missing one dish and the server was nowhere to be found for us to address the issue. Not to mention, the oversized server seemed more interested in her own comfort than providing quality customer service.\n\nAs much as I would love to continue supporting this local business, it is hard to overlook the disrespectful behavior of the staff. It's a shame that the grandmother's hard work in the kitchen is overshadowed by the poor attitude of the front of house staff. Unfortunately, I will have to think twice before returning to this establishment. "

My friends and I were excited to try out this restaurant in Laval as we had heard great things about the ambiance. However, we quickly realized that the food was not on par with the atmosphere. As a large group of about 40 kids and parents, we were relieved to find a spacious area for us to dine in. The staff seemed slightly overwhelmed, but they managed to accommodate us. Unfortunately, two of us had our orders forgotten and mine was even brought out incorrectly. I had ordered a specific burger and was given a different one instead. By the time my correct meal arrived, everyone else had finished eating. I was disappointed and hoped that my bill would be adjusted, but of course, it was not. I had to specifically request for a manager to come and remove the charge for my incorrect meal. Our waiter and waitress seemed to think it was normal for me to pay full price for a meal that was served wrong not once, but twice. Looking around, I noticed that others in our group were also not satisfied with their meals. No one raved about the food and some even expressed their disappointment. It's a shame because the ambiance was lovely, but the mediocre food and lack of consideration for customers leave me giving this place a 3-star rating."

Well, my experience at this place was definitely not the best. Despite the high ratings, I was disappointed with the overall atmosphere and service. Upon walking in, I was greeted by a not-so-friendly girl who seemed to be having a rough day. I tried to brush it off and continue with my check-in process, but unfortunately the negative energy continued. \n\nThe facility itself was also underwhelming. The paint was chipped and the overall cleanliness left much to be desired. As for the beds, don't even get me started. The staff member, Kristin, seemed too busy to give me any information or even a simple tour. I was left to figure out the outdated 1990s boom box on my own. \n\nFor the price I paid, I was expecting much more. Instead, I felt like I was in a run-down, budget motel that I could have paid $3 for. And to add insult to injury, the advertised Yelp check-in deal was not even valid. Overall, a major let down."
531,"I remember growing up, Olive Garden was the \""fancy\"" place for a family dinner. It was the place my parents took me and my sister to celebrate a good report card, a local competition win, or a special birthday. This is also where I took my date for our first high school homecoming dinner. \n\nFast forward 15 years, my well traveled older self have come to realize that this is far from the authentic Italian food that has established itself amongst world cuisine with its fresh, rustic ingredients and detailed workmanship in the kitchen. But there are a few things here that still have me coming back after all those years of cultural growth:\n\n(In no particular order)\n-Great drink selections\n-Endless soup with any entree\n-Zuppa Toscana\n-Dolcini (guilt-free cup sized mini deserts)\n-All day lunch portions served at reduced prices\n-Prompt service and friendly staff\n-Consistent quality\n\nSo next time you're in town and not sure where to go, there is something for everyone at the Olive Garden."

I really wanted to love this place, with its cool musical and art-inspired names and its convenient location near ASU. However, my experience at this sandwich joint was far from impressive. I ordered the Overture sandwich, expecting a delicious combination of horseradish and roast beef on a baguette, but what I got was a major disappointment.

First of all, the roast beef was so chewy that it was almost impossible to eat. I had to struggle through each bite, hoping it would get better but it never did. And while the horseradish did have a good kick, it couldn't make up for the tough beef. To top it off, the ""baguette"" was more like a soft French roll, which didn't add anything to the overall taste or texture.

To make matters worse, the sandwich was poorly constructed, with all the ingredients piled on one side, leaving me with bites of just beef and horsey sauce. It was a messy and unsatisfying dining experience. The only positive thing I can say is that the proximity to ASU and free parking were a bonus.

Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sandwich. It may be a decent option for students on a budget, but for a food lover like myself, this was far from a destination. And while I appreciated the complimentary cookie, it couldn't make up for the disappointment of my lackluster sandwich. Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location in the future."

My friends and I decided to check out PJ Clarke's to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. I had heard about the place before but never had the chance to visit until now. The restaurant itself was clean and had a nice ambiance, especially since it wasn't crowded on a holiday weekend. The menu was simple and straightforward, with a good selection of steaks, seafood, burgers, and appetizers. But let's talk about the prices. Yes, they are a bit steep, but that's expected for a place on the strip and in the Forum. The portions were decent, but I was a bit disappointed with the prices for non-steak items. I ended up ordering the Cadillac Burger, which was tasty but not worth the high price tag. Our appetizers, tater tots, calamari, and onion strings, were all on the salty side, as was the Lobster Mac ordered by my friend. But what really dampened our experience was the service. Our server took forever to take our order and then just dropped off the food without asking if we needed anything else. To make matters worse, I had an allergic reaction to my dessert and had to wave down another server for help while our own server was busy chatting with his friends. And to top it off, the automatic tip was added to our bill, giving our unattentive server a hefty tip. Overall, not a fan of PJ Clarke's, but I still had a great time with my friends and the birthday girl. Maybe Happy Hour is the way to go, but for now, PJ Clarke's gets a 3-star rating from me."
535,"Came here on a Sunday night. We enjoyed the ambiance. It was a big dining space but at least half full. The service was also good. But the food was just OK. We ordered a white sangria, pretty tasty and very little alcohol -- just the way we like it. We also got a side salad that was fine, but not memorable. The shrimp fresca pasta was extremely buttery but not very salty, and the shrimp were overbreaded. The tenderloin tips were also OK with the beef being a bit chewy. We would probably go to Cheesecake Factory next time we're in the mood for big portions of classic American fare."

Before visiting this place, I had high hopes. I had heard great things about their staff and their services from a trusted source. And while the staff was indeed very friendly and accommodating, my experience fell flat in terms of quality and price.

The first time I utilized their services, I was in a dire situation with my air conditioning unit. It was peak summertime and the thought of living without AC was unbearable. So when I was told about the steep price for the job, I reluctantly agreed. However, the second encounter left me feeling taken advantage of.

My furnace was not working and upon my own troubleshooting, I found the issue to be the ignitor. I was told that this part would cost a whopping $317, which shocked me. After some research, I found the same part from the manufacturer for a fraction of the price. It was a simple fix that I was able to do myself, leaving me wondering why I was quoted such a high price.

I understand that companies need to make a profit, but this just felt like a gross misconduct on their part. It's disappointing to see a business with such potential resort to such tactics. And while I appreciate the great staff, I cannot overlook the overpricing and lack of transparency. I may consider returning with a more budget-friendly mindset, but for now, I will have to take my business elsewhere."
537,"

I had high hopes for this place based on the reviews, but my experience was far from satisfactory. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, jalape√±o coleslaw, and dirty rice, and let me tell you, I wish I had just gone to Famous Dave's instead. While the food looked appetizing in the photos, the taste left much to be desired. The pulled pork lacked any real flavor, and while the bbq sauce helped a bit, it wasn't enough to save the dish. And don't even get me started on the dirty rice. It was dry, lacking any meat, and had barely any veggies - and the ones that were in there were clearly dehydrated. I don't even think it was made from scratch. The coleslaw was just as disappointing - no flavor, just a faint hint of jalape√±o. Even the bun for my sandwich was lackluster. Maybe it was just a bad day for the kitchen, but based on my experience, I would not recommend this place. Stick to Famous Dave's or any other BBQ joint, because this one just didn't live up to the hype."
538,"

I can definitely see why this place has such a loyal following. The staff are incredibly friendly and always efficient at getting you in and out in a timely manner. The organization of this place is admirable - I've never seen a bar set up like this before. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good deal? The $1 off coupons and recycling initiative are a unique way to keep customers coming back. It's clear that this establishment cares about the environment and their customers' wallets. Not to mention, the bar boasts a wide selection of alcohol, so you're sure to find your drink of choice. However, I did notice that the atmosphere was a bit lacking. The music was a bit too loud for my liking and it was a bit crowded, making it difficult to fully relax and enjoy my drink. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but not one that completely blew me away. I would definitely come back for the convenience and discounts, but maybe not for a full night out. "
539,I was really disappointed tonight! My baguette was a little soggy and the cafe sua da was definitely not the same. Let's hope these kinks get worked out in due time because I know a lot of us have been waiting for Vegas to get a Lee's for a long time now.
540,"My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a nice steak and raved about Strip House in New York and said I would love it if Las Vegas location was same as New York. The waiter was awesome, but when we received our steak, it didn't taste the same. He asked for the steak to be split becasue it was a large cut. I am not a steak eater so I don't know when a cut is bad. His cut was great, but I kept chewing and chewing and eventually I gave him some of my cut to see. He noticed I was struggling, but assumed I was chewing slow. He spit his piece out and asked to speak to the Manager. He let the waiter know how he felt and was disappointed with my cut. They said it was from the same cut, but he disagreed. The Manager approaches and his response to our complaint was highly unprofessional. He comments were uncalled for when situation was explained. He said you ate it so nothing can be done about it even though he was told I wasn't a seasoned steak eater. He lied saying he came from new York location when my boyfriend mentioned names, he was clueless. He was very immature and childish and defensive. His hospitality skills were horrible, customer skills even worse and all he did was remove the side dishes ordered. We were not looking for a free meal, but something to be done to rectify serving a bad cut of steak which was a pretty penny. My boyfriend was outraged at the poor service the Manager gave portrays Strip House to be a place that doesn't care if a patron is satisfied or not. I cannot recommend this location due to his performance and will let the New York location know of our horrible experience in Las Vegas."
541,"I met some friends here for dinner and drinks, finding the place is a little tricky especially if you don't make frequent trips Uptown. \n\nThey offer valet but I'd suggest just parking I the BoA parking garage and taking the elevator down to the restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, nothing fancy but you should expect it from a BBQ joint. The place wasn't busy so we were seated right away. \n\nThe menu is not very extensive, but includes all the classics : ribs, pulled pork and brisket just to name a few items. For starters we ended up ordering some wings. It's not a bad deal for just $5 you get half a dozen wings with blue cheese and some other dipping sauce. The wings were very tasty! The came out hot and packed with flavor. \n\nFor my meal I went with the pulled pork sandwich and cheese grits. Meh, it was okay. I've had better pulled pork at other BBQ places and they didn't really give a lot of meat on the sandwich....more bun than meat is no bueno!!! The cheese grits were decent...but again nothing to write home about. If I came back I'd stick with the wings. \n\nSo why the low score??? Aside from the average food the waitress/bartender had a horrible attitude. I've said this before and I'll say it again....if customer service is NOT your thing....please do us all a favor and pick another job!!! Shitty service ruins the experience and meal every time! Even if the food had been better I'd have to strongly consider give my money to someone who rolls their eyes at me and my guests AND ignores my requests while I'm eating (excuse me for needing a refill on my drinks and extra napkins....ugh!). \n\nSo try this place at your own risk...or just grab some wings to go!"

My wife and I were eager to try this restaurant since we had heard some great things about it. We even managed to snag a table before the dinner rush. However, from our first bite to our last, we couldn't help but feel disappointed.

First of all, the prices were quite steep for the quality of food we received. We ordered some classic Chinese dishes, like hot and sour soup and entrees with side dishes. But everything seemed to lack the authentic flavors we were hoping for. It almost felt like we were eating at a low-end takeout joint that only reheats leftovers.

The highlight of our visit was seeing a group of Chinese businessmen in suits dining in one corner. It was reminiscent of a scene from a classic movie, but that was unfortunately where the nostalgia ended. The service was subpar and lacked any warmth or friendliness.

To top it off, my friend had given this place a glowing five-star review just five years ago. It seems like the restaurant has changed ownership and the new owner is cutting corners to make up for the high costs of the location.

I have to agree with Dave R's review. It's definitely worth reading before you dine here. But if you have the luck of finding a decent parking spot in this busy center, save yourself the disappointment and head over to Q Bistro instead. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you."
543,"Yesterday I needed to meet a client from North of the valley and I had other customers to visit in Deer Valley.  There are not many places in the area open for breakfast that are not chains so I picked here.  Getting there at 8 I probably missed most of the folks getting breakfast or picking up a sandwich to take with them for lunch. The guy who runs the place has almost an attitude but you warm up to him pretty quick.  \n\nI ordered the Max burrito which comes with egg, potato, cheese and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham ($4.29). It was pretty tasty.  It is moderate sized.  Price per ounce is easily twice that of a similar burrito at most of the local Mexican fast food places.  Part of that cost is location (Deer Valley is not cheap) and employee cost.\n\nWhile I was there there was a steady stream of folks coming in but never really busy.  It is hard sometimes to get in the parking area because of the backup for the Dunkin Donut located at the other end of the building.\n\nI am sure I will go back again because it isn't a chain, the food was OK and the service was pleasant."

At first, I was excited to try this restaurant since it was a Fox concept and they usually have great food. Our waiter was awesome and made the experience even better. However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I saw the prices on the menu. $18 for fajitas? I couldn't believe it. But then I took a bite and I have to admit, they were some of the best fajitas I've ever had. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned, making it the star of the dish. I didn't even touch the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large. I would have been satisfied just eating that. 

But despite the deliciousness of the fajitas, I couldn't help but feel like I was being ripped off. $18 for a plate of fajitas is definitely overpriced, and it's hard to overlook that no matter how good the food is. I'll happily go back for the amazing fajitas, but I'll definitely have to save up a bit before coming back. Overall, my experience was bittersweet - great food but at a high cost. "
545,"I can only speak for this location but the Thrifty here sucks!! I booked through Hotwire and got the bullet on this round of russian roulette. \n\nLet me set the scene.....Friday afternoon around 4:00. We walked up and were second in line, \""sweet\"", I thought foolishly. It took 35 minutes for the ONE person in front of us to be helped. There were two agents for the Thrifty side and the one chunky black guy in the suit was chatting it up with people for about 5 minutes out in the lobby area after escorting someone down to the car pick up area. Then he comes up and screws around on the computer for nearly 5 minutes before seeing a large breasted women with a low cut dress in the Dollar line and helping her before us (and we're a good looking couple in our late 20's not exactly hard to look at)! She literally had just walked up and was helped immediately while our line had now grown to at least 15 people. I was about to explode at this point but calmer heads prevailed and I could not be 100% sure he was a Thrifty agent since he was right by the line between the two (after we had been helped I saw him helping the person behind us so he was definitely a Thrifty agent). The older white lady with red hair helped us and was very pleasant but at this point I was not really interested in her chit chat. \n\nSoooo if getting a car in a timely manner and being helped by professional agents is not a big deal then by all means choose Thrifty!

This Subway was an absolute disaster. The staff were unfriendly and careless, making our experience one of the worst we've ever had. We couldn't help but notice how dirty and unkept the employees looked, with one man in particular having disgustingly long fingernails and greasy hair. It was as if they had picked up a random person off the street to man the checkout. And to top it off, our sandwiches were thrown together with no care or attention. The sloppy appearance of our food was a major turn off and left us feeling disgusted. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this Subway at all costs. We certainly won't be going back."

I had high hopes for this Mexican restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was just really bad. The place was practically empty and the service was incredibly slow and lacking in any kind of enthusiasm. And let's talk about the food - it was cold and just plain bad. Even the drinks were watery and unimpressive. How can one mess up margaritas, I thought to myself.

Mexican food and margaritas are supposed to be simple and delicious, but clearly this restaurant missed the mark. It takes a lot of time and lack of preparation to achieve such a mediocre result. I won't go into every little detail of my wife's disastrous birthday luncheon, but let's just say it was a comedy of errors. And to top it off, it was Sunday during Week 6 of the NFL and they forgot to change the channels, so we had to listen to infomercials while eating our subpar food.

Honestly, this place is not worth the price we paid. Five times the cost of our favorite Mexican spot and only a third of the quality. That's a ratio that just doesn't add up. Save yourself the disappointment and check out Roberto's instead. Trust me, even with a few margaritas in me, I would still only give this place 3 stars."
549,"I would really give it 2 1/2 stars if I could...but I grade on a curve. \n\nThis place is fine. It is basic american-chinese food. It is better than buffet-places, but like other reviewers have said - there is better Chinese food available in pittsburgh.  (ie. China Palace in Shadyside)\n\nThey have a good lunch special and the service is pretty fast for a large dining room. The location is great. It is a good lunch spot downtown to sit, have lunch, and be on the go within an hour.  \n\nYou will not impress a date or client with this place...you (or they) could do better.  But for a get-out-of -the-office for an hour lunch with friends, this will do just fine.\n\nThe restrooms are weirdly outside the restaurant in the lobby of the YMCA.  Which is fine, just weird."
550,"So our office tried something different for lunch than our more frequented 'renovated home\"" type restaurants that we usually go to in downtown Phoenix. Because this is close to a place we usually go \""That's a Wrap\"" we decided we'd try this place out for take out too.  The parking lot is a bit odd because its large/loose gravel....but there seemed to be plenty of spaces so that def. a bonus!  The atmosphere was really laid back and really pleasant. Very friendly staff seemed to be everywhere, so that was nice too. \nMy order was a take out order for about 10 people in my office. I thought for sure I'd be taking out 4 bags...but they had very economical/green packaging (paper boxes and paper wrappings) . So it was nice to only see 3 bags (once I got the food...which unfortunately took 40 mins. instead of 20 to prepare). But hey, it was busy and I had almost 10 orders...so no biggy. As far as the food, they didn't have baked beans as they state on their menus, nor did they have steak for their steak tacos. (weird...it wasn't even 12p yet and they were out of food?!) Back at the office, everyone enjoyed the food. It wasn't anything over the top nor was it 'plain'. So compliments to Coronado Cafe for that (usually some places are too froo froo for me downtown).  I had gotten the portobello sandwich w/ potato salad. The sandwich was very yummy. It  had onions, cheese and other ingredients and was on focaccia bread which added just the right amt. of flavor to the sandwich. \n\nAlthough the food is good, I do wish the food wasn't as expensive as it was. (For I know the 1/2 sand. and 1/2 salad combo, that others ordered from the office,  really wasn't that big of a portion). All in all...nice little place with good food. Try it out!"

I had such high hopes for this restaurant when I walked in, but boy was I sorely disappointed. Let me start by saying that the concept of a make-your-own stir fry sounds fun and innovative, but in execution, it was a disaster. The entire place felt corporate and impersonal, with no real character or charm.

But let's move on to the food. The options at the buffet were extensive, I'll give them that. But the bowls were all soiled and dirty, which definitely did not leave a good first impression. And while there were over 30 sauces to choose from, I found myself sticking to the same few each time I went to make a new bowl. And that's where the disappointment really hit - when my bowl was taken to the chefs to cook, they sloppily dumped it on a dirty, rotating grill that was way too close to my neighbor's pile. Not to mention, pieces of my ingredients were falling into the catch basin while they were being flipped - talk about a waste.

But the final straw for me was when I found out that they only serve shrimp during dinner. Who does that? And to make things worse, my mom, who had been hoping for shrimp, had to settle for a mediocre crab rangoon. The only saving grace was the free dessert they sent out for her birthday, but even that couldn't make up for the messiness and disappointment of the whole experience.

I had pretty low expectations for this restaurant, and somehow they still managed to fall short. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, especially if you have food allergies. Save yourself the trouble and skip this place."
553,"Decent Mexican - in particular, Oaxacan-style cuisine.  As like every hotel/casino based restaurant, it is exceedingly overpriced.  Drinks are ok - I ordered a glass of $10 sangria - I've had better.\n\nPrior to your meal, you get your chips and dip; but you get three different types of dip with an herbal/salt accompaniment.  It was generally ok, so it was fine to eat this while biding time for my entree.\n\nThe enchilada platter was pretty good, but again - I've had better.  My friend had chicken tacos - again, there's been better.\n\nMy last name is Diego, and so we had a fun time trying to convince our waiter to give us a discount because I share the same name as the restaurant (walking promotion, right?)  Of course, it didn't work."

I was initially drawn to Souvia by their selection of loose teas, but have since realized that they offer so much more. The cozy atmosphere and friendly service make it the perfect spot for an informal catch-up with friends. And let's not forget about the pastries - they are absolutely divine! \n\nOne of my favorite things about Souvia is their tea of the month selection. I may be a grown adult, but I couldn't resist the October tea with cute cat and bat sprinkles. And if you're not sure about committing to a whole pot, you can always sample the featured teas of the day at a discounted price.\n\nThe only downside is that I live an hour away, so trips to Souvia require a bit of a drive. But every time I go, it's worth it. I just can't resist their free tea sniffing policy, which allows me to explore their vast selection of teas without any pressure to purchase. Overall, a great spot for tea lovers looking for a relaxed and enjoyable experience. "
555,"Food was decent for a buffet, nothing spectacular but decent Chinese food. They filled the drink glasses as soon as they were empty so that was nice as well. The bathrooms left a LOT to be desired for cleanliness. The doughnuts are worth going for if you get them when they first come out! Man they were good!!"
556,I don't see what the big deal is about this place. Yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best. We both had the crab cakes and they were horrible! And the service sucks. We were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came. \n\nThe bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks. And she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management.\n\nI should've gone to The Capital Grille instead.

I had such high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it fell flat. First off, let me start by saying that I don't speak Arabic, and I shouldn't have to in order to place an order. But it seems like the only employees here are fluent in Arabic. How am I supposed to know if I'm getting the correct food or if they're understanding my order? The lack of communication and understanding made for a very frustrating experience.

I had heard great things about their bean, cheese, and rice burrito, but to my disappointment, I was given a bean and cheese burrito instead. Not only did they get my order wrong, but the lack of variety on the menu was also very underwhelming. And to top it off, when I called to complain, the person on the other end of the line didn't even speak English. How am I supposed to voice my grievances when there's a language barrier?

I'm a loyal customer to a fault, but this was the third time they've messed up my order, and I can't take it anymore. I'll be taking my business elsewhere to a place that can actually understand and cater to my needs. I gave this place a fair chance, but unfortunately, they couldn't deliver. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless they learn to speak English and provide better customer service. What a disappointment."

I had high hopes for Atami after hearing positive reviews from friends and coworkers. Unfortunately, my experiences at this sushi spot have been less than satisfactory. My first visit was decent, but the service was a little cold. However, my second visit was a complete disaster. After a terrible day at work, I decided to treat myself to some takeout from Atami. I called ahead to make sure they were open and was told they were until 9pm. I arrived at 8:45pm and was told they were closed. When I mentioned that I had just spoken to someone on the phone who said they were open, the man working there proceeded to argue with me. In the midst of this argument, his wife (or at least I think it was his wife) started yelling at him in a language I didn't understand. At that point, I was too exhausted to argue and just asked for something simple to go. The wife continued to yell at the man while making my order and, needless to say, the customer service was unacceptable. On my way out, the man rudely told me to leave. I was shocked by the level of disrespect and rudeness I encountered at this establishment. Thankfully, I found Sushi Style down the road and received exceptional service and food. It's a shame that Atami's food is decent, but I refuse to subject myself to such terrible treatment again. I do not recommend this place and will not be returning. "
559,"I love bbq and had been waiting a while to go this place, because I wasn't sure if it was a good restaurant or not.

My mother could make better ribs with more meat on them than what I had received at this restaurant. The sauces were disgusting and the waiter didn't even bother to give us biscuits even though they were complimentary. I tried the chicken, but it wasn't anything as expected and was definitely not up to par, this being a bbq restaurant. I didn't even try the beef and for three people we ended up paying around $65 with the tip for a very unsatisfied lunch and setting. I will not come back to this place of establishment."
560,"I read reviews for movies, restaurants and products all the time. How did I forget to read the reviews before dropping $200 on this show I don't know. I've always wanted to see it. I heard they changed it after a performer died, but I still thought it would be good. I was wrong. I wish I had seen it years ago before they changed it. We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked? I didn't have an answer, as I was wondering the same thing. Go see Mystere or O at Bellagio if you want a Cirque de Soleil show, chances are you'll be disappointed with this one."
561,"Overall, I had a less than satisfactory experience at this hotel. While the rooms were clean and new, everything else was subpar. First of all, the location was not ideal. The noise from the pool party and nearby bars and clubs was incessant, even on the 32nd floor. The hotel does provide ear plugs, but it's still disruptive for anyone wanting to get an early night's sleep.

In addition, the parking situation was confusing and the valet service was slow. There is an option to self-park in a nearby garage, but you have to get your parking ticket validated at the check-in desk, otherwise you'll have to pay. It's not a bad system, but it was a hassle to figure out at first.

As for the amenities, the only standout factor was the bread for the meatball sliders and the choice of tap beer. The pizza tasted like a generic casino buffet pizza, the wings were nothing special, and the spaghetti was dry and unappetizing. I even had to wait 20 minutes for my order of ""nuke fies"" which were unevenly seasoned and tasted like they were thrown together in a hurry.

To top it off, there was an additional $20 resort fee per day on top of the already high web price. I was disappointed to find out that this was not optional and felt deceived by the hotel. While I understand this may be common practice in Vegas, it still left a bitter taste in my mouth.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you're on a budget and don't mind the noise and chaos of the Fremont area. There are certainly better options out there, but for the price, I suppose it wasn't the worst experience. I'll give it a month for the hype to die down and the novelty to wear off, but for now, I can't say I'm impressed."

I was excited to try out Sassoon based on all the positive reviews I had read online. However, my experience turned out to be the complete opposite. As soon as I walked in, I could tell something was off. The salon was understaffed and it took over an hour just to get a basic pedicure.

My friend and I were placed on a list and patiently waited for our turn. Little did we know, it would take forever for the staff to attend to us. We watched as they kept taking in new customers, without notifying us of the long wait. Finally, when it was our turn, our pedicures were rushed through and not done properly.

I specifically asked the technician to remove all the dry skin from my cuticles, but it seemed like he had no idea what he was doing. And to make matters worse, he abandoned me mid-pedicure to attend to another customer. My sister's experience was even worse, as she was left sitting with her feet in paraffin for 20 minutes while her technician went off to work on someone else.

But what really pushed me over the edge was when the owner asked my sister if she was in a hurry. How could she not be after sitting there for 20 minutes without any progress on her pedicure? The whole experience was a complete waste of time and money. I would not recommend this salon to anyone. A complete disappointment from start to finish."
563,"I went here for dinner tonight as part of a work outing.  I ordered a cup of the pozole and the machaca plate.  The salsa was good.  The chips seem to have been salted six to seven times.  Not appealing.  The pozole was sweet.  When the waiter asked me how it was I was honest.  He told me said, \""sweet?  I've never gotten that out of the pozole\"".  Nice people skills.  Try an apology or something nicer than basically saying I was wrong. The machaca was salty to the point of inedible.  The refried beans were extremely salty as well.  My coworkers complained of the same saltiness in their meals.  Their cook needs to learn how to season the food.  Or maybe taste it before you send it out.  I'm going back to San Diego tomorrow and I'm going to get some good pozole.  I would rather dumpster dive for food than eat here again."
564,"This place is a cute little cube in the middle of a sad, thrift store parking lot with a drive-thru liquor store. However, they've created a nice atmosphere that is somehow enjoyable. \n\nI went for \""Happy Hour\"" and was shocked that their happy hour menu pricing was $9-$10 for a glass of wine! Made me wonder what their prices were normally? Yikes. There were no appetizers or food specials either. However, the place was packed, so apprently they don't need to offer attractive deals to get the after-work crowd.\n\n The service was completely overwhelmed and uninformed, but geniuine and sweet and I wasn't in a hurry so it was fine.\n\nThis is likely a great place for coffee, lunch, etc. But I definitely won't be back for happy hour. There are just too many other places where I can get enjoy a drink after work without going into debt."
565,"I've been to Hickory Tavern 3 times now.  All 3 times, during lunch.\n\n1st time @ Mallard Creek - 2 people - build your own salad.  Impressive and thoughtful menu item.  Great options.  Kudos for this.  The cucumber wasabi dressing is amazing.\n\n2nd time @ Harris - group of 8 - burger and fries.  Meh.  Pretty standard fare bar food.  At least the beer was cold.\n\n3rd time (16SEP2014) @ Harris went something like this - 3 people.  11:15 - get seated by greeter, total of 5 customers in the restaurant.  11:20 - people around us are getting their drink and food orders taken, some of these people came in after us, we have not been greeted by a server.  11:30 - drinks and food start hitting tables around us.  11:35 - still not greeted by a server, so we stood up and left.  As we left, I made eye contact with the bartender, I'm sure anger and disappointment was over my face.  I don't have a shred of tolerance when it comes to being ignored in a restaurant.\n\nI make it a rule to avoid places that disappoint me like the plague, poor service being the worst offense.  There are many options in Charlotte for places to have lunch, this one is off the table for me.  If you don't want to send a server to my table, you can't have my business."
566,"It is unfathomable to me how a place full of dbag hipsters and the nouveau riche can manage to be so sh*tty and pretentious serving mediocre food and awful beer. Customer service is nonexistent here and the place routinely smells like vomit. Seriously, what is that smell??? Much be the stink of the attitudes. Have been here with friends twice for celebrations. Would never voluntarily return with SO many better options in the neighborhood. Ugh. Hope this deliberately trendy place crashes and burns and makes space for a real, quality brewery and not something thrown up with a ton of money to attract past-their-prime frat boys trying to act like they can stomach something other than Bud."
567,"So. I just got back from Vegas, and stayed at, of course.. The Palazzo.  Well, I must say.. couple months really did some damage to the casino.  Can't believe I'm going to give this place 2 stars but whatever has got to be done.\n\n(1) Service just got horrible.  It went from a solid A to a very average C.  And trust me, average is not acceptable in Vegas. With all the competition they have, it was very disappointing experience this time around.  From the front desk to the casino credit, it was very just average.  Maybe even a little below for the price they charge you for room.\n\n(2) Room was still big and comfortable as I remember. But can the cleaning service be upgraded?! If the room wasn't comped, I would've been even more mad... but because it was free, I can't complain that much right? But at $350/night regularly, it was quite annoying that the cleaning lady could not distinguish lotion between conditioner.  I was in the shower, shampooed my hair, great.  Time to condition my hair... but wait, what is this, the lotion? Since when did people lotion their body in the shower? Very irritating when it took me almost an hour brushing my hair just because someone can't distinguish between lotion & conditioner.  Also, I was looking for my glasses that I left on the nightstand for about an hour, only to realize that the cleaning lady decided to tuck it into the bottom drawer. (Even though I specifically told them not to clean anything BUT the bathroom). Ugh.\n\n(3)  Gaming wise... wow. Must say, pit boss's and dealers got super unfriendly.  Maybe they've been running into some not-so-great players, but honestly, what's up with the service?  Here we go again on the service.  Unacceptable, especially when the Wynn & Encore is just a bridge away.\n\n(4)  They charge you for an extra fridge and late-check out now. What? I know they're going bankrupt and all, but c'mon now. Are you really going to scare away your loyal customers so you can get a few bucks here and there?  I have never been charged for an extra fridge nor the late check out.  But this trip made me realize... The Palazzo really must be DESPERATE!\n\n(5) They don't comp cigarettes anymore. Wow. What else are you going to take, free alcohol? The Pit boss told me that it was because of health issues and regulations.  I assumed that this was all of Las Vegas's new rule and thought it was quite dumb but still let it slide.  Next day, I went to the Wynn/Encore to play, and the pit-boss comped cigarettes like nothing.  I was confused.  I then told the pit-boss what the Venetian/Palazzo told us about the cigarettes and all he said was, \""The Palazzo is still around\"" and laughed.  Seriously.  They're still around? They need to honestly up their game.\n\nMy loyalty has really gone down in the drains with this trip.  On the up side, theres always Wynn/Encore."

The only reason why I am even giving this airport 1 star is because I had a hassle-free experience at the security gate. Other than that, this place is a breeding ground for stupidity. It's like every time I go here, it's a gamble whether or not I will have a negative experience. Just like the airport, most people here seem to be in a hurry, but the difference is that they are all standing around trying to figure out how to use the slot machines. While that may be entertaining for some, I personally find it annoying and tacky. At least they have some of the essentials like overpriced water and chapstick, and a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf for anyone in desperate need of caffeine. But I guess even the airport knows that visitors will need to be constantly entertained in some way. And let's not forget the joy of trying to find an open outlet to charge your devices. Overall, not worth spending any more time here than necessary. Next time I'll make sure to avoid this airport and save myself the frustration."

The show was an absolute blast from the past! I remember watching it as a child and being too shy to participate, but now I would jump at the chance to fly around in that famous car. When I finally had the opportunity to see the show again as an adult, I was pleasantly surprised. The price was a little steep, but let's be real, what show in Vegas isn't pricey? The nostalgia alone was worth it, but the added entertainment factor made it even better. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I highly recommend checking it out for yourself. Don't be shy like I was, let your inner child come out and have some fun! "
570,"Just had lunch in their newly remodeled store.  This was by far the worst lunch we've had in quite some time.  Server brought my order and not my dining partner's.   The waitress checked back later and said the other order was \""dropped\"" and was reordered. Both food orders were awful.  It is hard to ruin a simple hamburger and onion rings but they managed quite easily.  The table behind us had their order messed up too.   We will definitely NOT be going back!"
571,"It was an alright place to stay. My room was clean and spacious. The bed was huge which was a plus for because I move around a lot in bed. They had and iron and ironing board which I needed desperately. Plenty of towels. Didn't have a coffee machine which I thought was standard now in hotels and motels; lose one star. They're \""all-inclusive\"" breakfast consisted of cereal and store bought danishes; another star lost. And everytime I was in the lobby, the receptionists were dealing with some angry customer, either in person or on the phone. All in all, my experience was pretty good."
572,"Does anyone who actually lives here ever buy anything here? I never have. The prices are ridiculous and the shit ain't that good, because ultimately let's face it: they're scouring Las Vegas for the best vintage clothing. LAS VEGAS.\n\nNay, this store is a trap and a lie. Our arts district deserves a better second hand clothing store."

My friends and I decided to meet at this sports bar to watch the UFC fight, but it was a mistake from the start. Despite the packed tables, the service was utterly lacking. In the two hours that we were there, our waitress only came by three times. By the time the fight was over, we were ready to leave without paying because our waitress had still not come to our table. 
But let's rewind. My friends had already eaten some food upstairs, so I couldn't try any of it before ordering. I decided to get 15 wings, which seemed like a safe and affordable option. I specifically requested them to be ""HOT"", but when they arrived, they were anything but. What I got was more like ""Honey BBQ"" or maybe ""Honey HOT"", definitely not anything spicy or hot. I've learned in the past that it's not a good idea to send food back on a busy night, so I just ate it because I was hungry. Big mistake. Less than 40 minutes later, my stomach was churning and I had to make four trips to the bathroom in the next 10 hours. It was clear that there was something wrong with their chicken or their grease. Those wings did not agree with me at all. 
To top it off, the TVs in the bar were all no-name brands. Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal, but the one we were sitting next to had red spots, sparkles, and burn-in. Needless to say, it was not a pleasant viewing experience. 
Overall, this was my first and last visit to this bar. It left a bad taste in my mouth, and let's just say I'll be making many more trips to the bathroom after eating there. Needless to say, I will not be recommending this place to anyone."
574,"This hotel could get either a 5-star or 1-star rating, depending on one's priorities. I chose to rate it 3, because as much as I loved the decor and the interior, a hotel should offer a safe haven- a place to quietly enjoy the night and morning hours. Unfortunately, while we thoroughly enjoyed the furnishings, the gym, and the service in the hotel, we were simply unable to sleep. \nThe problem wasn't with anything the hotel had any control over, but rather its location. It is in a very vibrant section of downtown Scottsdale, surrounded by bars and nightclubs that attract a loud and youthful clientele. We were there three nights, from Thursday through Sunday, and were unable to catch even a wink of sleep prior to 3:30am on any of those nights, despite being very sleep-deprived from each night's noisy surroundings. \nBetween the car alarms and the voices carrying through the desert air all the way to our fifth floor room, the sleepability of the hotel was simply untenable. \nBottom line- if sleeping is important to you, and or you are not nocturnal, and or you do not wear ear-plugs to sleep, you should avoid this hotel like the plague."
575,"I used to get takeout from here a lot. When I lived closer. It is really fine. Nothing to get excited about, but not terrible. I had the Pad Thai lunch special and it is nice that they use breast meat. I thought that it was too sweet and it is weird that it comes with rice. The fried rice is not great. Not bad tasting, just plain and not worth eating, really.   The service was very friendly."
576,It's not the cheapest pizzeria in the area but consistency is what I like most about Pizza Express. \n\nMy delicious favourite pizza tastes and looks exactly the same each time we go there. \n\nPersonally I have always found the well-trained staff to be attentive and professional in every way. However the atmosphere is a bit sterile and it's more of a lunchtime or teatime venue. I wouldn't choose it for a special night out.

My go-to spot for my morning coffee fix! The staff here is always so friendly, especially Katie who greets me with a smile even at the crack of dawn. I prefer Coffee Bean over other national coffee chains because I don't like supporting billion dollar companies and their seasonal drinks just don't do it for me. Plus, the employees at Coffee Bean are always happy to offer suggestions if I'm feeling indecisive. Their iced mocha is rich, smooth, and absolutely delicious. And don't even get me started on their cherry almond muffin - packed with cherries and almond goodness and super moist. But my favorite drink during the colder months is definitely the winter dream tea latte - think creamy milk tea with a hint of cinnamon. Plus, there's a great opportunity to give back - if you donate a pound of coffee to troops overseas, your drink is free! And mall employees get a discount with valid proof. Overall, a solid spot for coffee lovers."
578,Well on 5/29/14 I took my car in to get a wash and oil change. As they did a good job on interior part of my car etc my E-Cig ($80) battery was stolen out of my car from there. It is a lesson learned from me as you can't trust having your important stuff in your car while you wait. I know nothing will happen from this but as I work in auto industry (sell online diagnostic resourse) I will make sure this company has to pay highest prices for are software and will never return unless I need gas real bad and I am driving by. If I catch one of the employees at rush hour etc I feel bad for them. O my e-cig is missing well then how did that black eye get there;) Anyway screw them.
579,Fast and efficient although I would say I hardly ever have a supurb car-wash at this place even if I get the works. I always feel rushed to leave so when I end at my final destination I have to do a once around and get all little bits they missed myself. \nI would still say they do an adequate job especially since my car is always really dirty by the time I take it in... plus they are good about putting coupons out into the market so keep an eye out for them and save a few more bucks. \nAnd don't forget to tip the guys washing your car... it's hot and humid outside and they appreciate it.
580,"Any Cirque du Soleil shows are guaranteed to be a spectacle-- and sure enough Le Reve was no different. As much as I enjoyed watching hot men with hard abs jumping into water at great heights, 75 minutes of it was more than enough. Honestly, they lost me 20 minutes into the show. Maybe I don't appreciate the art-- but I really didn't get the storyline at all! I understand it's suppose to be \""A Dream\"" but a dream about what?! Hot men running around being hot? Fine, guess that's quite a dream.\n\nWe sat in the splash zone and barely felt any splash! Any seat in the theater is a good one but if you're looking to save yourself a little cha-ching.. do the splash zone!"
581,"Had dinner there last night with a friend.  We had an Asian waiter who appeared to be the owner (30-40s with glasses) and asked him for his recommendation.   He gave us the look \""are you serious\"" and we felt as if we shouldn't have asked.  After the awkward pause, we asked again and he made an effort to recommend their signature dish: bulgogi bibimbap ($15).   The restaurant wasn't too busy, about 35-40% filled on a Monday night.  The food was good and I'd rate it 4/5 for the bibimbap.  Before we left, I asked the owner about how to go about fixing my cracked dolsot (hot stone bowl).  He didn't seem to care and replied \""Oh you can't fix it\"".  It was an another awkward moment and perhaps I shouldn't have asked.  Trying to carry the conversation to avoid the awkwardness, I remarked, \""Dolsots are expensive.\""  He asked, \""How much did you get it for?  \""$30\"" I replied.  He then condescendingly replied, \""That's cheap.  Ours is more expensive. It's commercial.\""  The owner needs to work on his customer service skills.  In all fairness, he did do a good job refilling our water and we gave him the standard tip, despite his poor attitude. Bottom line:  Food 4/5, Price 2.5/5, Service 3/5."

Upon entering this establishment, I was hopeful for a satisfying meal. However, my experience proved to be quite underwhelming. Despite being quickly seated at a table, the lackluster burger that I had been eagerly anticipating left much to be desired. In fact, IN-N-OUT's classic burger far surpasses this one in taste and quality. The bun was stale and the overall burger was dry, leaving me quite disappointed. I can only hope that this was not a typical experience, but I am hesitant to give it another chance. Overall, this dining experience was nothing special and I would not recommend it to others. "
583,"Awful. We went for happy hour and ordered nachos and beer. The nachos were pathetic and made with cheese sauce and a very few pieces of chicken. My sister in law had chicken quesadilla and it had three pieces if chicken. To top it off, they opened the garage doors at 6:00, causing the inside temp to be 90 degrees. When we talked to the manager, he responded there was nothing he could do. Never going back."

I recently had my first experience with this healthcare provider, and while it did not go as smoothly as I would have liked, I can appreciate their efforts to help me find a doctor who would accept my plan. As a retired state employee, I have dealt with frustrating healthcare situations, and unfortunately, this has not improved since switching to Medicare. The provider directory, while promising a list of options, turned out to be completely unreliable. Many of the listings were either outdated or not contracted with the carrier, making it near impossible to find a suitable provider. After countless hours on the phone and failed promises of call backs, I turned to Hatfield Family Medicine. They were incredibly kind and did their best to help me, even though they were not directly related to my needed cataract surgery. It was thanks to their persistence and generosity that I am now able to schedule an appointment with a highly competent doctor who accepts my plan's meager payments. While the process was unnecessarily long and frustrating, I am grateful to Hatfield Family Medicine and look forward to my upcoming appointment. "
585,"I'm happy for the one person who likes this place but honestly my biggest problem is that out of $500 deposit I got back $2.33! They painted every wall in the place. I was there for one year, I didn't put up art and I don't have a kid to draw on the walls. Why did they spend half of my deposit to paint the walls?!? If they even did, its not like I could verify that it was actually done. That's why Pala Mesa sucks. Also, they're in the ghetto, just FYI, and they're expensive as hell for the location. Light rail sure, but also hooker motels, tweaker trailer parks and constant police copters overhead looking for criminals in the area."
586,"My friends and I are on a road trip from Sacramento, CA to Austin, TX and wanted good subs. When we opened them in the car we saw that there was barely any meat on the sandwiches and all the pickles were pretty disgusting.  We do not understand why this place has such a great rating....we do not recommend it at all."
587,"I'm going to reiterate what other reviewers have said previously. The service is completely lacking here. The servers - while friendly - take an exorbitant amount of time to come to your table. The kitchen - while making incredibly tasty food - is unacceptably slow. And the price you pay for both is just far too much for what you get. \n\nAs for kid/family friendly, I would try somewhere else or get carry out. This place is a brewpub that tries to be good for families, but in the end it's still just a bar.\n\nTasty food but not enough to make up for the other detractors."

I had high hopes for this place, as I am a huge fan of authentic Mexican taquerias. Unfortunately, my experience at this restaurant was less than impressive. The ordering process was a nightmare - we waited in line for over an hour on what was supposed to be a slow night. And when we finally got our tacos, they were a disappointment. The meat tasted like it had been cooked on a charcoal grill for way too long, causing it to be dry and flavorless. To top it off, the lack of ventilation in the restaurant caused the place to be filled with smoke, making it hard to even enjoy our food. And the guacamole? Let's just say it was a far cry from the runny, salty goodness I was expecting. I was longing for the taquerias back in Mexicali, where I'm from. As someone who loves Mexican cuisine, I was excited for this place, but it just didn't live up to the hype. Maybe the original location is better, but this one fell short for me. On the bright side, I will say that the bathroom soap was surprisingly amazing - it reminded me of the pumice soap at my friend's dad's auto-shop when I was a kid. But unfortunately, that was the only highlight of my visit. Overall, this place left much to be desired."

I decided to try out the new Dick's Sporting Goods in town because it was the closest one to me. With a Christmas gift card in hand and the intention of purchasing a new putter, I walked through the door and was surprised to see that the store was nearly empty. There were no customers in sight, and I struggled to find an associate who could help me. After wandering around for a bit, I finally stumbled upon a putter that caught my eye. But before I could make the purchase, I had a question about whether or not it came with a head cover. Unfortunately, none of the associates seemed to know the answer. Frustrated, I decided to call the store the next day and speak with a manager. However, after being put on hold for 20 minutes, I gave up and decided to just go to Golfsmith instead. While I don't have any major complaints, this particular location didn't quite have the same appeal to me as other sporting goods stores in the area."
590,"Although they have a good selection of cheeses, the store and their employees are definitely NOT kid friendly.   A very bad experience 3 yrs ago with one of the owners was so bad that it caused us not to set foot in the store again.\n\nIf you have kids, save your aggravation and don't bother going into the store. Fragile & glass items are set very low on the shelves and easily accessible from a stroller.   The store is so tight that you will have a hard time keeping your stroller or kids away from the items. If there are other people in the store, you will have no choice but to move closer to the shelves which becomes too temping for kids no to want to touch something....  And if your kids do touch something, you may get a scolding from an owner by reminding you that  items on the shelves are fragile and can break. Seriously, anyone telling me that a glass bottle or jar can break is just being rude... we get it... duh,  glass can break!  Maybe if glass items were not 2 ft off the floor, it wouldn't be such a big deal.  Unfortunately our experience is not isolated. We have friends who experienced the same thing at Formagination.   \n\nSo take this review into consideration - if you are with young children and are coming from the toy store just a few doors down, think again about walking into this store with them. You may just walk right back out and thinking to yourself, is this store really worth the hassle?  You may just find yourself going back to a local grocery store, co-op or cheese factory store for your cheese needs."

I recently visited Oneself Therapy for a massage and unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant. I had heard great things about this place and was excited to check it out, but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The therapist, Kenta, seemed to have no regard for my comfort or preferences. I had mentioned that I prefer a medium pressure, but he went in so deep and aggressively that I left the massage feeling bruised and battered. On top of that, the new location was not as relaxing or inviting as I had hoped. Overall, I would not recommend Oneself Therapy to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable massage experience. Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere for a skilled and considerate therapist."

This place definitely knows how to fill you up! I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size and flavor of the tacos - I couldn't even finish both of mine. The asada and al pastor were both packed with meat and had great flavor, especially the al pastor. My only complaint is that the taco shells were a bit on the small side, making it a bit difficult to eat without using a fork. But with the delicious pico, guacamole, and Mexican cheese, I didn't mind. The free chips and salsa were a nice touch, and the chipotle brown and bean dips were both very tasty (although I do prefer red salsas). And I have to mention the Dos Equis on tap - I ordered a beverage and got a HUGE glass of it, even if it wasn't in a traditional beer glass.  Not only was the food and drinks satisfying, but the fact that this place is open 24 hours is a huge bonus. And for the quality and price, I will definitely be back. Overall, a solid option for a late-night meal or a quick bite to eat. However, the small taco shells and the fact that I couldn't order any more beer after 11:00pm was a bit disappointing. Still, a decent choice if you're not in a hurry and willing to overlook the minor inconveniences."

594,"Visited Olives with the Hubs the night we landed in Vegas for a conference. I had made reservations online, specifically requesting a table out on the patio overlooking \""lake\"" Bellagio, and when we arrived, a table hadn't cleared yet. We didn't mind, and took two seats at the bar. There, I enjoyed the most delicious lemon-flavored cocktail, complete with sugar-rimmed martini glass & all! \n\nSoon, our table was ready & I have to say that we got a fantastic table, the perfect spot for me & the Hubs, right on the lake's railing... perfection. At least for Las Vegas :-)\n\nWe ordered another round of drinks and awaited the arrival of our entrees. The bread & olive tapanade served while we waited was nice, but nothing to go crazy for. I ordered a special of the evening - shrimp & pasta. Unfortunately, the shrimp looked a bit like fishing bait and I located a number of small shells throughout the dish, but the overall fresh, creamy lemon flavor was good - I wouldn't order it again. The hubs ordered a fish special of the evening, along with some asparagus, which he raved about. \n\nWe opted for a third round of drinks and some fountain-gazing after our meal, since we weren't \""feeling\"" the desserts at Olives.\n\nOverall the experience was lovely, drinks were killer, albeit a bit on the pricey side (it is Vegas, after all) and our table out on the patio was to die for. A great Vegas experience, not necessarily a great Vegas meal."
595,"I went here yesterday for lunch with friends. The food was pretty good, as usual (I had chicken parmesan and my fiance had an alfredo dish, which he said wasn't that good) but this time the service wasn't as superb. My fiance's silverware was dirty, and my Pepsi tasted flat. I ended up just drinking water. \n\nOur initial waitress mysteriously disappeared after getting our drinks... another waiter took over and said that the other waitress had to \""take off.\"" This was kind of confusing, because we saw her waitressing other tables right by us. Plus, I never like it when there are about 5 different people stopping by your table. One guy asked if we wanted more bread, and we said yes, and then he never brought the bread basket back. Different people brought out our dishes... and, nearing the end our waiter kept asking us if we needed anything (we were just sitting there talking), which made us feel like he wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had it been extremely busy and a long wait, but there was hardly anyone there!"

I was excited to try out the Monorail to get to the Wynn hotel for a convention. After all, it seemed like a convenient and modern way to travel. However, my experience with it was far from satisfactory.

First of all, the automated voice on the train announced that the Wynn station was no longer in service right when we arrived there. We had to backtrack to an earlier station, which was a total inconvenience. And to make matters worse, the stations were not air conditioned. Standing in the blistering heat while waiting for the slow and infrequent trains was not a pleasant experience.

Speaking of the trains, they take way too long to show up. At the MGM station, it felt like we were waiting for ages as the train went all the way down to the airport and then inverted itself to come back towards us. Wouldn't it be more efficient to simply kick it in reverse and use a switch to get to the other track?

The worst part was the price. For $5 per ride, the Monorail is definitely overpriced. I could have saved myself the hassle and discomfort by taking the SDX or DEUCE buses run by the county. Not only are they much cheaper at only $8 for unlimited rides in a 24-hour period, but they also run more frequently (every 3 minutes) and have an enclosed driver's area for safer and faster navigation through traffic.

Overall, my experience with the Monorail was disappointing and I would not recommend it to anyone. Save your money and take the bus instead for a more reliable and comfortable ride. "

I joined this gym with the best intentions - after all, who doesn't want to stay fit and healthy? But unfortunately, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with my overall experience. While the initial $16 per month offer was enticing, I was soon hit with a reality check when my renewal rate jumped to $25 per month without any warning. Despite showing proof of the original agreement, the staff at the gym refused to honor it. It's frustrating to feel like you were tricked into signing up and now have to pay a higher price for the same services. In addition, the equipment at this location is outdated and often broken, making it difficult to get a good workout. With so many other fitness options available, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. The only saving grace is that this gym is conveniently located, but that's not enough to keep me coming back. Buyer beware - don't get roped in by the initial low rates, as they may not last. "

Overall, I had a mixed experience at this restaurant. The layout and decor were on point, giving off a cute and retro vibe that I loved. But unfortunately, the food did not live up to my expectations. The green beans in my grilled chicken lunch were definitely the highlight, but the chicken itself was on the dry side. And don't even get me started on the coleslaw, it was just average.

What really surprised me was the lackluster service and unimpressive options on the menu. While one server was exceptionally friendly and helpful, my server was just okay. And with headings like ""Sammitches and Burgers N'at,"" I was expecting more Pittsburgh flavor, but unfortunately, there was not a pierogie or french fry to be found.

I will say, the fried green tomato ""sammitch"" my friend ordered seemed to be the shining star of the meal, but she may be a bit of a pushover. Overall, I would give this place 2.5 stars, with 3 being too generous and 2 being a bit too harsh. It's not a bad spot, but there are definitely better options out there. My advice? Stick to the bagels and you won't be disappointed."
599,I came to this location looking for beef ribs and was annoyed that they didn't carry them.  However I did notice that the meat they did carry looked amazing and were priced surprisingly cheap.  I picked up a package of amazing pork chops for $4!  The parking lot is a little crazy and the lines were slow and ridiculously long; seriously it took over ten minutes to check out.

601,"Went here for lunch. They had one server working which slowed things down but not enough to complain about, the server still did a pretty good job but I could see the more sensitive type knocking off for it. The food took a bit but the portions are pretty big. My wife got a bean and cheese  chimi and I got the Mexican pizza. The Mexican pizza was pretty much a cheese crisp folded over with some type of green chili. The Mexican pizza wasn't bad, about 3-31/2 stars and my wife liked her dish ok but nothing too good. The beans were not the best and nor was the guacamole. The soda was flat and tasted pretty bad. The chips and salsa were nothing to write home about. But again, the portions are big and the food is decent but I doubt we'll be back anytime soon."

They say that first impressions are important, but unfortunately for this store, they failed to make a good one. I had high hopes for this place, as it seemed like a one-stop shop for all my baking needs. But my experience here left a bad taste in my mouth. 

It's not just about the lack of cake decorating supplies, I understand that not everyone bakes cakes. But the staff's lack of patience towards customers, particularly towards the elderly, is completely unacceptable. How can a place that offers classes for baking not understand the simple concept of customer service? 

And let's talk about the staff's attitude. I understand that it's not easy to work in the medical field, but it's not an excuse to have a bad attitude towards customers. I don't appreciate being rushed through my scheduled appointment so the technician can take their lunch break. Sorry that you had a rough morning, but that's not my problem. 

Oh, and maybe before booking appointments, it would be helpful to explain billing procedures and other important information. I could have avoided this unpleasant experience if that had been done. Instead, I left the store feeling frustrated and disappointed. 

I won't be coming back here again. And I suggest for the staff to reconsider their values towards customers and to perhaps find a job in a different field. It's clear that working in the baking industry is not their passion, and it's affecting their ability to provide good customer service. As much as I love this store's selection of products, the lack of professionalism and respect towards customers is a major red flag. My advice: don't waste your time at this store, there are plenty of other places that offer the same products with better service. "
603,"One of the high end casino at Vegas.  A must stop.  A very large elegant casino, nice high end shops, the best fountain show ever, great rooms and a tram that connects you to other casinos like the Aria and Monte Carlo.  Next door to Cosmopolitan and across the street from Paris and Planet Hollywood. And on the corner  with a bridge to connect to Caesars, Flamingo and Bally's.  What a great location.  So why only 3 stars?  The shops are nice but the mall is small.  When you see the Caesar Forum or the Miracle Mile Shops or the Grand Canal Shoppes, this one will disappoint you.  The high end restaurants are kind of boring.  The reward program doesn't reward you.  I seem to lose here more often than the other casinos.  If the rates are reasonable, I would stay here all the time, but since they are not, I don't.  It still a must do while in Vegas."
604,"I went in to speak with this dealership about trading my car in, it was 845pm and they didn't close until 10pm.  I was met by a salesman, test drove the Lexus I saw on line and had them appraise my Lexus.  I had a guy come over to me on 3 different occasions that was very very rude to my husband and I, and never introduced himself to me.  I was there looking to spend nearly $40k on a car, so I do expect decent service.  The sales man asked if I met the finance manager, I said I'm not sure some very rude and demanding guy kept coming over and never introduced himself to me.  He apologized for the guys behavior and said he would introduce us once he came back.  The \""gentleman\"" and I use the term loosely because I guess it just sounds better than asshole, came back again and said he needed me to tell him what I want to spend on the car....?!?!!? WHAT?!?!?! Um I asked him to tell me what the numbers were looking like, he again said \""you need to answer my question\"" So I proceeded to tell him he has been rude since I got there and treated us awfully.  If you don't want to be at work at 9pm...go home but don't treat people like crap and expect people who don't know who the hell you are to discuss their finances with you.  And then he told us we needed to leave.  I called the dealership to file a formal complaint the next day and they refused to transfer me to someone that could assist, I sent an email on their website, and contacted the head of sales via email and have not heard back from anyone.  Per the website...this fellow who is oh so sweet and friendly is the Finance Director.  I would figure the dealership would try to do some form of damage control or at least try to say sorry for their employee treating us like shit.  Needless to say, I'd rather buy a brand new car from Lexus for $40k and be treated like a human and not like someone that is a waste of time.  Needless to say, this was by far the worst experience Ive ever had with a dealership and Id advise you go anywhere other than there if you want to buy a car"
605,"Several years ago we dined a few times at this restaurant and were not impressed, but I had points to burn and the current menu indicated 21-day, dry aged beef is now being served so we (actually I) decided to give it one more try - silly me.  \n\nEntrees include a choice of potato and salad with my wife choosing garlic mashed that were puree like and garlic-lite.  My baker with sour cream was better.  The salads were primarily iceberg lettuce that had been topped with diced tomatoes, a couple of olives and red onion tossed in for good measure and dressed with bottled blue cheese.  \n\nThough our slabs of cow were served medium rare as requested, it took a Herculean effort to just to cut them into bite sized pieces.  Our server seemed to be on auto pilot and never once stopped by to inquire if we need anything or had concerns.  This was proved to be by far the most disappointing meal of our entire 14 day vacation."
606,"We stayed for one Saturday night. That was probably the appropriate amount of time to stay, because I never really did feel settled in. The people at the front desk were nice, but were almost trying too hard to sound American if you know what I mean. The hostel has its own bar with decently priced beers (\u00a32 for a Tiger) and a good breakfast complete with haggis. They also had laundry facilities on site. It cost \u00a31 for the dryer, which doesnt sound bad but we needed to put our clothes through twice to get them dry and it wasn't even a quarter full (we only put in what we were wearing as they had gotten soaked in the rain). Also, it was really loud outside on a Saturday night. Overally, it was good enough especially for the cheap price."

I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it fell short. We ordered take-out and the sushi was barely edible. I could tell my friends were struggling to eat it and they even complained about how bad it tasted. As for my salmon teriyaki, the portion of rice was minuscule and the salad was simply gross. It was so soggy and wilted that I could barely stomach it. To make matters worse, we had to practically beg for extra soy sauce and they only gave us a tiny bit of wasabi. It's obvious that they're very tight on portions and extras.

I was so disappointed because this place is conveniently located near my friend's house. We really wanted it to be good, but unfortunately, it just didn't live up to our expectations. Maybe it was just an off night, but I won't be giving this place a second chance. Hopefully, they get their act together, but until then, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. Don't waste your time or money here. Trust me, there are better options out there. "

The only good thing about this specific theater is that the chairs are pretty comfortable, but in all.. that's it. \n\nIf you ever make the choice between Regal at StoneCrest or at another establishment, pick the other place.\n\nOh and don't get me started on the price!! $31 for 3 people!

I can definitely see why this restaurant is always packed - the atmosphere is bustling and there's always a lively crowd. However, our dining experience was pretty hit or miss. Sure, the service was top-notch and our server was attentive and friendly. But it's a shame that they were out of the prime rib - that's what I really wanted! Instead, I settled for the New York Strip and while it was good, it just wasn't what I was craving. The sides were tasty though - loaded mashed potatoes, buttery corn. And can we talk about that bread and cinnamon butter? Absolutely a must-try. But overall, I just left feeling a little underwhelmed. It's a shame because I remember coming here before and having a better experience. Maybe it's just the luck of the draw, but next time I think I'll venture off the strip for a better dining option."

I had high expectations for my stay at this Vegas hotel, as it seemed like the ultimate luxury experience. However, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I arrived at the front desk and was met with a long line and slow service. After finally getting checked in, I headed to my room and was underwhelmed by the outdated decor and musty smell. The fountain show that I had heard so much about was indeed impressive, but the constant crowds and overly enthusiastic photographers trying to capture every moment made it hard to fully enjoy.

I decided to give the on-site brunch a try, hoping it would redeem my stay. But unfortunately, the overwhelming size of the buffet only meant one thing - the quality was lacking. I struggled to find anything that stood out in terms of taste and ended up leaving with a full stomach but disappointed taste buds.

To make matters worse, the staff working at this hotel seemed more interested in flirting with each other than providing decent customer service. I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the obnoxiously loud and unprofessional behavior I witnessed between employees. It was clear that this hotel's priorities were more on creating a chic atmosphere rather than ensuring a pleasant stay for their guests.

As I checked out and reflected on my experience, I couldn't help but feel like I had been deceived by the impressive facade of this hotel. It's safe to say that I will not be returning."

I have never had such a terrible movie experience until I came to this theater. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable, and to make matters worse, my chair was broken not once, but twice! It was impossible to recline back and enjoy the movie, let alone try to cuddle with my date. And let me tell you, I was not the only one with a broken chair. As I looked around the theater, I saw others struggling with their seats as well. To add insult to injury, the staff was not at all helpful or accommodating. When I brought up the issue after the first broken chair incident, they simply shrugged it off and told me it was a common occurrence. How is that acceptable? And to top it all off, the prices for tickets and snacks were outrageous. I will never, ever come back to this theater. Save yourself the headache and go elsewhere. This place is a nightmare. "

I have been to Hooters many times in the past, and recently visited their location off the strip. I remember when this place used to be called Hotel San Remo, but now it's Hooters casino/hotel/restaurant. Honestly, I didn't find it to be the most convenient location.

When it comes to the restaurant, my friends and I usually go for the wings while we're drinking. The wings taste pretty similar to other Hooters locations, but I will say that the staff here was better than what I'm used to at my home state. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.

My friends stayed in a regular room, but did have a nice backdoor access to the pool. However, the cleanliness of the room was not up to par and the furniture seemed to be on the older side. It was definitely not as nice as I remember it being.

Overall, I would say this place is just okay. It's not terrible, but it's also nothing special. The prices are a bit high for what you get, and I even think Applebees might be a better option. I used to come here all the time, but now that I've moved back to Vegas, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. Disappointing to see a decline in quality."
613,"this is not the place to go for fabulous mexican food. it's not bad, but it's like going to applebee's and expecting a great steak.\n\ni really only like their happy hour cause it comes with free food. mini chimis, chips and salsa and taquitos and such are free if you sit in the bar. i haven't been in awhile, and all locations are different, but from i remember, margaritas weren't a HH special, which is pretty much blashpemy. for friday HH there is usually a DJ. \n\nthis particular location has been going through some heavy renovations, as there will be a light rail stop literally on their patio doorstep (p.s. the otuside area is HUGE), so imagine in the next few years this plca will have a fairly large crowd for HH all week long."
614,"For $2 a ride, it's a cheap way to see the Strip and the people on it are a mixed crowd.  There was a combination of couples, families, and flat out drunk crazy people.  I really feel sorry for the bus drivers that have to deal with these weird people.  It took about 45 minutes from the front of Paris to  Fremont Street.  The ride is really slow because there are so many stops and traffic get so slow on the Strip.  If you're not in a rush, the Deuce is the way to go."

Woke up craving something different for breakfast and stumbled upon Bread & Butter cafe and bakery on Yelp. The reviews raving about their waffle ham and egg sammie caught my attention, so I knew I had to give it a try.

The cafe itself had a cozy atmosphere and the free Wifi was a plus. Luckily, I didn't have to wait long for my food on a weekday visit.

When my order arrived, I was greeted with a towering waffle sandwich filled with ham, eggs, and melted cheese. The combination of savory and sweet flavors was a delight for my taste buds. However, be warned- this is not a sandwich you can eat with your hands. I had to use a fork and knife to tackle this monster.

While the food was enjoyable, I couldn't help but notice the lack of options on the menu. It seemed like most of their dishes revolved around variations of waffles and breakfast sandwiches. And although the baked goods looked tempting, I wished there were more diverse choices.

The service was friendly and efficient, but nothing particularly stood out to me. Overall, Bread & Butter cafe and bakery is a decent spot for breakfast, but I'm not sure if it's worth a repeat visit. Maybe if I'm in need of a quick Wifi spot, I'll consider stopping by. But for now, I'll probably continue my search for a more well-rounded breakfast spot."
616,This place is a real dump. Glad I changed to the other Travelodge close to MGM rather than this one. The staff was friendly but the hotel is in dire need of an update or maybe a fire.  There are many better bu diet hotels for less money in town.
617,I hate two lane drive thru. Unfortunately I live in the area.  Three times now they go out of order and I get stuck waiting for someone to acknowledge my lane.  Once they took two orders at the other lane while I sat waiting.  Poor procedure inside.  Each time no apologies and no offer to compensate even when I asked today. Go elsewhere like In N Out across the street.

I had such high hopes for this Starbucks location, but unfortunately, my experience was a complete disappointment. First of all, the parking situation is a disaster. The only spots available were super tight and it's a nightmare to maneuver in and out of the cramped lot.

When I finally made it inside, I was greeted with the most lackluster customer service I have ever experienced. The barista seemed more interested in her phone than taking my order, and when I asked about the availability of pastries, she just shrugged and said they were out. No apologies or alternatives offered.

But the worst part was the wait time. I'm not exaggerating when I say I waited at least 20 minutes for my drink. And this wasn't just me, the line behind me was growing and everyone seemed equally as frustrated. When my drink finally arrived, it was completely wrong. Seriously, how hard is it to make a simple vanilla latte?

Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience at this Starbucks location. The lack of customer service, parking nightmare, and long wait time make me never want to come back. Save yourself the trouble and go to a different location, I certainly won't be returning to this one."
619,"I have never experienced such rude mean service from the security staff.\nI was there for a bachelorette party this past weekend and holy sht it was beyond packed I'm surprised that the fire department didn't shut this place down.\nThankfully we had reserved a table and purchased bottle service everything about the bottle service was fine up until all decided to go downstairs and dance, did I mention how crowded it was.  As we were walking downstairs I was pushed into one of guard the  A$$wipe takes me by the arm and slams me against the wall and starts pulling me thru this maze of a back room. After witnessing how they beat up on some guys I was horrified that they would do the same with me, eventually they asked the meat head that took me back there what i had done and the he said I had given him lip and pushed him, really??? it was an accident I didn't push you I said, after apologizing for something that I didn't do they let me return to the party. I got my stuff and LEFT I was not going to spend any more time there. \nThe next day I woke up with bruises on my arms and on my legs. I would not recommend this place to anyone it's not worth it this place is way too crowded.

They provided a very small bit of gravy for the chicken.  The gravy tasted like it was made with dirt.   The Hamburgers were overcooked but other than that they were typical fast food burgers.\n\nThe staff is very rude at this location and get impatient if you do not know your order when you walk up or if you ask any questions.\n\nThe restaurant itself always seems dirty, more than once we have had to switch tables because their was some sort of goo or food leftovers on them.\n\nI tried to find some Joy in ChickenJoy but alas, my second trip was as bad as the first."

The pork taco from Boston's happy hour menu was a standout dish, with its unique and delicious flavors. However, our experience quickly went downhill as we ordered our main courses. The Macadamia crusted mahi and seared ahi tuna both had a strange smell and tasted spoiled. It makes us wonder if this could be due to bad food inventory practices. Unfortunately, we didn't get to enjoy much of our dinner as both my friend and I ended up with slight cases of food poisoning. The seafood at Boston's is definitely a hit or miss. It's best to stick with their pork dishes or avoid the seafood altogether."

I've been to my fair share of diners, but this one really didn't impress me. Sure, the food was cooked to perfection and the portions were generous, but there was something lacking in the overall experience. Maybe it was the dated decor or the constant sound of oldies playing in the background, but I just couldn't get into the 50s diner vibe that this place was going for. It almost seemed like they were trying too hard to be nostalgic.

Now, let's talk about the food. I've had both breakfast and lunch at this spot and while the dishes were flavorful, they weren't anything out of the ordinary. The breakfast menu offers all the classics you would expect, but the coffee was just average. As for the sandwiches and burgers, they were tasty but not mind-blowing. I appreciated the fact that they source their beef from a local farm, but the flavors weren't anything to write home about. And while I usually have a major sweet tooth, I wasn't impressed with their waffle fries either. They were decent, but not worth the extra cost.

The service here is top-notch though, I have to give them that. The staff is always friendly and attentive, going above and beyond to make sure you have a great experience. I just wish the same effort and attention to detail was put into the decor and ambiance.

One major concern I had was the proximity of this diner to a regular bakery. As someone with gluten sensitivity, I couldn't help but worry about cross-contamination. I know flour particles can stay in the air for days, and that's definitely not a risk I'm willing to take. I wish they would address this issue or at least have a separate ventilation system for the bakery and the diner.

Overall, this place didn't live up to the hype for me. It's not bad by any means, but it's also not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit again. Maybe for a quick and satisfying meal, but not for the nostalgia factor."
623,"My wife and I were really looking forward to trying out this restaurant and yesterday we were severely disappointed.\n\nWe came Friday around 130PM for lunch.  Got seated no problem, great.

They were not understaffed as there were always servers available, but our server came around about once every fifteen minutes.  From the time we sat down to our first bite took about 30 minutes.\n\nThe food was average and overpriced for what we received.  It tasted fine but not much better than our usual nice restaurants, but at 50% the price premium.  The juice my wife ordered was the deal breaker.  9 dollars for a glass of watered down orange juice, and it was super sour (you'd think a 5 star hotel's restaurant would pick out nicer oranges.)\n\nAll in all, maybe the Sunday brunch would have been better.

My friends and I decided to check out this diner after hearing some good things. The atmosphere was pretty nice and we were excited to try the food. I ordered the steak, which was cooked to perfection and I have to say, it was probably straight from the steakhouse behind it. The sides were also delicious, with creamy mashed potatoes and fresh veggies. I even treated myself to a blue cheese topping on my steak, which was a perfect touch. Surprisingly, the salad and dinner rolls were included in the meal, which was a nice surprise. 

But, unfortunately, the good food was overshadowed by the poor service. Our waitress seemed to have better things to do than to attend to us. Every time we tried to talk to her, she would suddenly walk away. Even something as simple as asking for a box took multiple attempts and was met with a lack of attention. It's a shame because everything else about the diner was great, from the atmosphere to the food, but the service really put a damper on our experience. I also wish there was some kind of waiting area or paging system, as it was a bit of a chaotic mess trying to wait for a table during busy times. All in all, good food but lackluster service. "

I had high hopes for this place based on the Yelp reviews, but sadly it fell short. Despite the unique twist of using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream, the price point is simply too high for what you get. We paid almost 8 dollars for a scoop of ice cream with a pineapple topping, and that's just not worth it. 

The process of making the ice cream was interesting to watch, as they use a liquid nitrogen technique and mix in the topping of your choice. However, the end result was not as impressive as expected. The texture was not something I am used to and while the flavors were decent, they were nothing exceptional. 

On top of that, the location itself was difficult to find and had very few customers in the evening. This, combined with the fact that our waitress had trouble communicating with us due to her limited English, made for a less-than-pleasant experience. In fact, I would liken the taste of the ice cream to something you could find in the frozen food section of a grocery store. 

Overall, while it may be worth a visit to see the unique process, I would not recommend this place to anyone. It's a shame to see such potential go to waste. There are plenty of other ice cream shops in the area that offer better flavors and value for your money. "

I've been a fan of Izakaya food for years and was excited to try out Ichiza. I have to say, it definitely brought back memories of my time in Sin City when I would come here once or twice a week. However, upon returning to California, I haven't been able to find another Izakaya that compares to Ichiza in terms of quality and affordability. In these tough economic times, it's definitely a relief to find a place that won't break the bank. I have to give a special shoutout to their frequent diner discount, which we were able to take advantage of within just two months of going there regularly.

Izakaya food is all about small bites and flavor combinations, and Ichiza definitely delivers in that department. The ginger dressing on their lunch salad is to die for, and I could eat it every day. They also serve fried won-ton chips with it as an added bonus. I highly recommend trying their Ginger Beef with peanuts ‚Äì the spicy sauce paired with tender beef will make your taste buds sing.

The reason I'm giving Ichiza three stars instead of a higher rating is because I've noticed that their consistency can be hit or miss. Some days, the food is absolutely amazing and other times, it's just average. If they could improve on their consistency, they would easily earn a higher rating from me. But for now, I'll keep coming back for my weekly fix of delicious Izakaya eats. Give it a try for lunch next time you're in the area."

My friend and I were excited to try this place, as it had been highly recommended by just about everyone. The line was long, but we were willing to wait for what we thought would be a delicious dining experience. However, we were quickly disappointed. 

The rye bread in my sandwich couldn't even hold the large stack of smoked meat that was stuffed between the two slices. And while the messy eating experience can be part of the charm, the lack of toppings to complete the sandwich was a letdown. 

The whole place had a deli vibe to it, which we were expecting, but what we weren't expecting was the lackluster food. It seems like this place has grown too quickly and has lost the quality that everyone raved about. Our sandwiches were just average, and definitely not worth the hype. 

I remember hearing such great things about this place, but unfortunately, my experience falls short. I'm not sure if I would give it another chance. Maybe it just wasn't my day, but for now, I'll stick to the other options in town."
628,I have been to this Best Buy numerous times. It's conveniently located however this Best Buy has the absolute worst customer service I have ever witnessed.On two separate occasions a worker has failed to answer my questions when I have been willing and able to wait to buy a product. I have also tried to call the store to check on a vacuum and I can't even get through past the automated phone service. This just turns me off to Best Buy completely.
629,"After noticing the $6.89, 16inch garden thin crust pizza we got it, but it was cold and not near the $6.89 price on the menu. Total waste and lies! After telling the waitress our service got real bad. You can't charge different prices. Looks like a consumer protection issue here!"
630,"I went there about 2 years ago so I hope things have changed. I was looking for a simple (but well-done) cut that wasn't too expensive. After looking all over the internet, I decided I would give Tonic a try and ask for Emilie to cut my hair. \nWell, I got the simplest cut ever (which I could have replicated in my bathroom)! It didn't suit me (I was hoping Emilie in all her knowledge would provide more input besides selling the products) and cost me 70$ NOT including tip!\n\nThis was the very last time I set foot in a hair salon and I have been happily cutting, styling and dying my hair myself ever since to great results. The highlight of my experience was the delightful Romanian student who washed my hair (with extra neck and scalp massage Mmmmm!). I hope she's still around!"

Joyce was our server during our Sunday night dinner at this pizza place. She was very attentive and friendly, making sure our large family was well taken care of. However, the food was underwhelming. While the pizza came out quickly, it was just your average greasy diner-style pizza. Perfect for a late-night snack when other options are limited, but not worth going out of your way for. We had heard good things about the pizza here, but unfortunately it didn't live up to our expectations. On the bright side, our kids, ages 7 and 3, seemed to enjoy it and finished their slices with enthusiasm. Overall, our experience was just okay. We may come back for a late night craving, but it won't be our go-to spot for pizza."

Unfortunately, my last experience at this salad bar was less than satisfactory. First of all, the prices have gone up significantly since the last time I visited. Not only that, but the serving size seemed to decrease as well. I guess they haven't heard of inflation or customer satisfaction. But that's not even the worst part. There were hardly any vegetarian protein options available on the salad bar. And to make matters worse, the blue cheese dressing, which used to be delicious, was now watered down and barely recognizable. It's safe to say that my salad was lacking in both flavor and substance. But it gets even worse. When my friend and I asked for refills on our drinks, we were met with eye rolls and attitude from the server. And let's not forget the dirty silverware and greasy tables. Needless to say, I will not be lying about my whereabouts anymore when it comes to this salad bar, because I won't be returning. Save your money and your taste buds, folks. There are plenty of other salad options in town."

I joined Physix with high hopes after seeing positive reviews and hearing great things from friends. Unfortunately, my experience fell short of expectations. My family and I attended a circuit training class, which was a bit disappointing. The class was advertised to have 10-12 stations, but there were only 8 set up. Additionally, the workout was not as intense as we had hoped it would be and some exercises seemed repetitive. Maybe this particular class was just not the right fit for us, but overall, we were underwhelmed.\n\nOn top of that, the staff seemed a bit disorganized and unprepared. As a pregnant woman, I had to modify some of the exercises, and I felt like I had to constantly remind the instructors about it even after discussing it with them beforehand. Furthermore, they didn't seem to have a plan for modifications and just had me do whatever I felt comfortable with. It would have been nice to have more guidance and support in adapting the exercises for my situation.\n\nLastly, the price seems reasonable at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it can add up quickly. There are extra fees for participating in community runs and events, and the cost of membership can be a bit daunting for those on a tight budget. Overall, I would say Physix has potential, but our experience was not worth the hype or the cost. Maybe it works better for others, but for my family and I, we will be looking for other fitness options in the future."

Nosh and Swig is definitely not what it's cracked up to be. Despite all the hype and positive reviews, my experience at this restaurant was a huge disappointment. First of all, their menu is filled with fusion flavors which may sound interesting, but in reality, it just creates a confusing mishmash of tastes. And let's not forget about the prices - they are far from reasonable and definitely not worth it for the small portions they serve.

The worst part, however, was the service. Despite the owners being present, the staff seemed to be completely indifferent and uninterested in their customers. Maybe they were too busy Instagramming the ""hip and modern"" decor to actually pay attention to their job. And to top it off, the wait times were ridiculously long, which is unacceptable for a tapas restaurant.

Overall, my experience at Nosh and Swig was a complete letdown. I had high hopes for this place, but it just couldn't deliver. I don't see what all the fuss is about and I certainly won't be going back anytime soon. I'll stick to my usual spot, Firefly, despite its ""continual downfall."" At least there, I know I'll get good food and decent service. Save your money and skip out on this overrated restaurant."
635,"My husband and I went to Spa Mio today to use gift certificates we received for Valentines Day.  We also received some great coupons in the mail, so it seemed like the perfect time to go.\n  My first impression when led into the spa area was that it was beautiful.  Very relaxing, comfortable atmosphere with plasma tv's showing peaceful images, great variety of magazines and a bowl of fresh fruit.  They also had a tray sitting out with cucumber water, as well as fruit drinks.  So far, I was impressed.\n  Then it was time for my 80min massage.  My therapist was very nice, but it just wasn't a great massage.  I was so disappointed because when I scheduled the appt., I asked the receptionist to please give me someone good as I get many massages and am a bit picky when it comes to them.  I asked the therapist to increase the pressure and she said \""sure\"" but then proceeded to dig her elbow into me. I hate it when they do that, that is not what I mean by deeper.  After the disappointing massage, I was on to my pedicure.  The pedicure was fine, but honestly not any better than my usual pedicure I get at the nail salon down the street from my house for half the price.  Also, when I booked the pedi, I asked the receptionist how long the treatment would last and she said it would be an hour.  It was just barely 45mins.\n  The attendants in the spa were extremely nice and helpful, however, at one point they were talking very loudly complaining about other co-workers.  Not exactly what you want to hear when trying to relax.  Also, they were using the co-workers names and I couldn't help but think how they would feel if I walked up and said \""hey, that's my sister/friend, etc you are talking about\"" lol.\n  When I met up with my husband, he was not very impressed with his overall experience either.  We both decided we would tip 15% to our therapists.  We always tip 20%, but didn't feel it was warranted today.  Well, when we checked out, they informed us that a 20% tip is automatically included, unless we wanted to rectify the amount.  We felt very stupid and put on the spot, so just said that was fine, but it was annoying.\n  I don't think we will be returning anytime soon."

I'm just going to start by saying that my experience at this restaurant would have been a mediocre one, if it wasn't for the horrendous service and minuscule portion size. I could overlook the pretentious atmosphere and the high prices if the food and service were up to par, but unfortunately, that was not the case.

Let's start with the service. Upon arrival, we were seated at a table near another occupied one, even though there were plenty of other empty tables in the restaurant. It was clear that the server had no consideration for our comfort or privacy. And to make matters worse, the narrow aisle next to our table constantly had servers rushing back and forth, causing us to get bumped and jostled throughout our meal. It was a truly frustrating experience that could have easily been avoided with some common sense and proper seating arrangements.

As for the food, it was a major disappointment. I ordered the salmon dish and was shocked when it arrived with only a few measly bites of fish on the plate. And don't even get me started on the accompanying side dish, which was practically non-existent. I couldn't believe that they charged such high prices for such small portions of mediocre food. As a health-conscious individual, I was also appalled by the lack of nutritious options on the menu. Do they not realize that potatoes and white bread do not constitute a healthy meal?

Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience. The service was inconsiderate and the food was underwhelming, to say the least. Save your money and go somewhere else where you will actually get what you pay for."

The fish here is definitely worth trying. It's cooked to perfection with just the right amount of batter and not too oily. The owner is very passionate about their food and it definitely shows in the quality. However, the service could use some improvement. While the owner was friendly and welcoming, the rest of the staff seemed disinterested and almost annoyed with our presence. It was quite disappointing, especially since we were the only customers in the restaurant at the time. Our waiter seemed more focused on checking his phone and watching TV than taking our order. It's a shame because the food itself is great. I would definitely recommend trying the fish and chips, just don't expect top-notch service. And if you do have any questions about the menu, be prepared for an unenthusiastic response. Overall, it's a solid spot for fish and chips, just don't expect exceptional service."
638,"This was my first time buying a car (that I would have to make monthly payments on) and I was searching the valley for the perfect one. Going to Honda, Toyota, Jeep and many more locations and dealerships I also went to this location to check out a very specific model of Volkswagen. I was greeted warmly in the parking lot and immediately told the sales associate what I was looking for (pre-owned and a few years old). After showing me one car on the lot that was a brand spanking new 2014 beauty I informed the associate that although the car is wonderful and I am not buying a new car. I asked him if he could check out the inventory for me and he happily walked me inside and sat me down at his desk. After a very long process of giving him my information (he typed with two fingers and seemed as though he had never used a computer before) we got NOWHERE in even looking at inventory. I was handed off to 3 other sales associates up to the floor manager all trying to sell me a 2014 brand new car. I felt like I was speaking a different language and they were so incredibly pushy and disrespectful. I will never recommend this place to anyone. Horrible sales attitudes and after traveling to numerous lots all over the valley this place really upset me. I was called a few weeks after to \""have me come down and check out their new inventory\"" and after telling Tommy I already purchased a vehicle, he literally repeated what he had just told me \""come down and check out our inventory\"" I was so infuriated they were STILL pushing me. \n\nOh yeah and I ended up buying a pre-owned Volkswagen Tiguan that I absolutely love from Lunde Peoria Volkswagen who has the most lovely staff and treated me with respect and helped me find my perfect car."

Last night was a complete disaster, and it was all thanks to our terrible experience at this nearby restaurant. From the moment we walked in, the ambiance was off-putting and lacking any sort of welcoming energy. We were promptly seated, but that's where the good service ended. Despite only a handful of other diners, it took a ridiculous 15 minutes for our server to bring us our drinks. By that time, we were already feeling like we were an inconvenience to the staff.

But as we all know, a bad first impression can be easily overlooked if the food is top-notch. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The Portuguese pork chop was greasy and tasted of old oil, and the milk tea was watered down and bland. Even the noodle dishes, a staple at any Asian restaurant, were just mediocre.

Honestly, the only saving grace was the eggrolls, but even those were nothing to write home about. And to add insult to injury, the prices were much higher than we expected. We could have easily gone to Chinatown for a much better meal at a fraction of the cost.

In hindsight, we should have just gone to our go-to spot, Carnevino. We've never had a bad experience there, and the food is always exceptional. As a loyal customer of their other restaurants, we were blown away by the lack of service and quality at this establishment. Needless to say, we will not be returning and will be avoiding this place at all costs."

My husband and I were excited to visit this store after hearing so many great things about their customer service. However, our experience was anything but exceptional. We were in search of a new helmet for my husband, and despite spending nearly two hours in the store, we left empty-handed. Tyler and Nate were not only unhelpful, but also rude and dismissive. They showed no interest in helping my husband find the right helmet and instead seemed more focused on chatting with each other. After expressing our frustration, we decided to leave and take our business elsewhere. We were shocked and disappointed by the lack of customer service at this store. Needless to say, we will not be returning and will not be recommending this place to anyone. Save yourself the headache and go somewhere else for your riding gear needs."
641,"I ordered from here a few days ago and because of that experience, I will NEVER order from Papa John's again. I ordered from my phone (like I always do) and paid with my credit card (like I always do-which they charged immediately) and had my bf go pick up the pizza on his way to my place (like he always does). They would not give him the pizza because apparently they have a new policy that the person paying has to be present. Ok, I get it, you guys implement a new policy. Business's are completely allowed to do things like that. No problem. However, it would be nice for the customer that when they are placing the order, there is some kind of notice that states this policy so I could have made my decision based on that.\n\nSo I called and spoke to a girl there (Jennifer or Jessica?). She was rude from the moment she started talking. Telling me how that's just their policy and there's nothing that can be done about it. I then told her that I think that is wrong of them since it never said anything about needing to be present online when I placed the order. She then proceeded to ARGUE with me saying that it does say it on there as well as in the confirmation email. I told them to refund my card since they refused to release my order, which they did. I then went back to the email (and read EVERY LAST WORD. It NEVER mentioned this policy. I also went back to the mobile order screen and it also DOES NOT STATE THE POLICY! So there was no way to know of this policy before ordering. \n\nI immediately wrote to customer service and told them of my experience and even offered to send proof that the policy was not stated anywhere! I received the automatic reply that my email was received but have yet to have any real response. I wouldn't be surprised if they sent my complaint to the store directly so of course they won't respond. What a joke!"

The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave's cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.\n\nWe enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn't call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soon on my way.\n\nThe only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I'd just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.\n\nI'll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong."
643,Very very bad. Got in at fri 4am the needed a room for a few hours of sleep. Arrived charged full rack rate instead of quoted players rate that i normally get.

Went down a forth time and was givin a different room along with keys. Guess what no workie had exchanged keys another 3 times and finally got in. After screwing around tired and cranky i asked what can be done to adjust room price. The woman behind the counter gives me a coupon book and smiles. Wow. I was a repeat customer but will no longer be coming back. The room was dirty i just gave up. Word of advice stay away. Even the casino restrooms had pee all over the floor...save yourself the hassle.

My recent experience at Red Robin's Happy Valley location was far from satisfying. Though the service was decent, the same could not be said for the food. I ordered their Prime Rib sandwich, a personal favorite of mine, but was disappointed to find that it was significantly smaller than what I am accustomed to at other Red Robin locations. For a whopping price of over $13, I was expecting a generous portion of meat, but instead, I found myself struggling to find any at all. Perhaps they have recently downsized their portions, but either way, it was a major letdown. 

To add to the disappointment, the atmosphere of the restaurant was lackluster. While the service was fine, the overall ambiance was underwhelming and uninviting. It was almost as if they hadn't updated their decor since the 1980s, with peeling wallpaper and outdated furnishings. And to top it off, the air conditioning was either blasting cold air or not working at all, leaving me feeling uncomfortable and restless throughout my entire meal.

Overall, I would not recommend this particular Red Robin location, even if it is conveniently located in Happy Valley. Though I may consider giving another location a chance in the future, this recent experience has left a sour taste in my mouth. For the cost of the meal and the subpar quality, I would suggest looking into other dining options in the area before settling for this one."

I don't expect much at ALL from Cosi.  But really, I DO expect them to make what I order.  Their food is OK, at best, and I'm OK with that.  I'll go to Soleil if I want flavorful food.

I have been to this place a few times before and always had a decent experience. But my most recent visit was a major letdown. I decided to bring my out-of-town friend here last night after a long day of exploring the city. We arrived around 11PM, excited for our usual half-off menu favorites. However, we were greeted with a rude shock - they were out of so many key ingredients. My friend ordered their famous Chopper Salad, only to be told that there were no chickpeas or two other main ingredients available. Talk about a disappointment!

To make matters worse, the service was extremely slow and the wait staff seemed disinterested in providing us with good service. The music was also blasting so loud that we could barely hear each other talk. It was definitely not the ideal setting for a nice catch-up with a friend.

To add insult to injury, my friend's drink was way overpriced and the portion size was minuscule. And while the food we did manage to order was decent, it certainly did not make up for the lack of options and poor service.

I had always recommended this place to my friends for a cheap late night meal, but after this experience, I will be hesitant to do so. It's a shame because the food is usually good, but the lack of basic ingredients and poor service definitely put a damper on our evening. I will be thinking twice before coming back here."
648,"What a horrible place!  I order a stew...little did I know it was going to be one of the most salty, tasteless meals I've ever eaten.  There was suppose to be Cilantro in the stew...there wasn't.  I ask for some and the waiter brings my parsley! He tells me they don't have cilantro, yet the menu clearly said there was cilantro. The owner sometime later came by to ask me about the meal, I told how bad it was...he said thanks and turned around.  My sister ordered a beef Kabob...menu price was $17.  The waiter asked if she wanted this or that. We get the bill, and her meal costs $25!!!  She thought the meal tasted good, but said she'd never go back again. We got the bill for $60!!!

650," Just be aware of the hidden costs. Upon arriving, I was informed that my massage would be $50 for an hour. However, when my masseuse saw that I had dry skin, she insisted on using their special lotion for an additional $20. I was caught off guard but didn't want to argue, so I agreed. But then, during the massage, she started using some type of essential oils that she claimed were necessary for the full experience, which ended up adding another $15. And finally, at the end, she asked if I wanted a glass of water, which she then charged me $5 for. All in all, my $50 massage turned into a $90 experience, and I wasn't even asked if I wanted those additional services!\n\nAfter expressing my frustration with the hidden costs, the masseuse became defensive and insisted that it was all clearly explained in the fine print. But as a customer, I shouldn't have to read through every detail to know what I'm actually paying for. Additionally, the massage itself was average at best. The masseuse kept talking throughout the whole session, and I didn't feel any lasting benefits from the massage. Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone. 

I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this massage place. While the staff seemed friendly at first, I quickly realized that it was all just a ploy to get me to spend more money. The advertised price of $50 for an hour massage quickly turned into a $90 ordeal of hidden costs. The masseuse insisted on using expensive lotion and essential oils, without even asking if I wanted them, and then charged me for a glass of water at the end of my session. When I expressed my frustration, the masseuse became defensive and claimed that it was all clearly stated in the fine print. But as a paying customer, I shouldn't have to read through every detail to know what I'm actually paying for.

Aside from the sneaky pricing, the massage itself was just average. The masseuse kept talking throughout the whole session, which was quite distracting. And to top it off, I didn't feel any lasting benefits from the massage. When I brought up these concerns, the masseuse just shrugged it off and didn't seem to care about my satisfaction as a customer.

It's truly unfortunate that businesses nowadays prioritize greed over providing quality services to their customers. We shouldn't have to constantly be on guard for hidden costs and be taken advantage of. As a society, we need to demand accountability from"

I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience at Szechuan. Despite the initial convenience of its location near my workplace, the food has consistently failed to impress. The menu boasts a wide variety of options, but each dish I have ordered has been a disappointment. The portions are large, but mainly filled with bland, overly fried tofu. The sauces are greasy and way too salty - even for someone like me, who loves a good salt kick. And to top it off, there was a strange fishy flavor in every dish that made it difficult to stomach. \nThe restaurant itself is also quite unappealing - dingy and uninviting. I keep telling myself I'll never go back, but I get desperate for a quick meal and give in to the proximity. However, after my most recent experience, I can confidently say that I will never step foot in this establishment again. It's just not worth it. The food may be cheap and quick, but the poor quality and off-putting taste do not make it worth the convenience. Save yourself the disappointment and find another option for a quick meal."
652,"After everyone raving about this place and Martha Stewart eating here we knew we had to go. We gave it three different tries. We are done. I fail to understand the appeal of this restaurant or how they stay in business. The food is decent, but don't be hungry or have any place to be as you'll be waiting. And waiting. That's after you've waited and waited for one of the empty tables. Then there is the completely incompetent, rude and totally unprofessional staff to round out your miserable dinner."
653,"The food was GREAT.  Since we were there for restaurant week, we were able to enjoy a sampling of their items and loved everything (ceviche, nachos, mahi mahi tacos).  The service was okay.  The food was so good that I really want to give it more stars.  I never thought decor and energy of a place would be such a turn off but sadly, it was for me and Distrito.\n\nMy main issue with Distrito is that the decor is too colorful and busy.  It also seemed too casual (i.e. outdoor seating of picnic tables) given the menu seemed a bit more upscale.  We were seated at a small table inside that had a bright pink glittery top. Alone it would have been super cool but it was too much to take in with the multi-colored and differently designed walls and tables around us.  We asked to move to a table with a normal top which was a table too large for just 2 people.  A couple of the walls and the bungee cord divider reminded us of Easter Basket designs which was strange.  Overall, the place is a bit of an eye sore.  \n\nThe energy level in the place was very low but it was a Monday night and the bartender said it's much livelier Thursday-Saturday."

I stood there and right in front of me I see the Men's bathroom door and a folding table filled with napkins, silverware, and menus. Its pretty rare to see a server station look like that all out in the open.  The place was half full at 2pm. Servers were walking around but no host to welcome new customers. I stood there for about 5 minutes without getting greeted by anyone. The food isn't worth the terrible service. Never coming back."

My friends and I stumbled upon Pugzie's one day and decided to give it a try. The first thing that caught our attention was the unique setup of the restaurant - with two different counters for main meals and desserts, and the bathrooms being located outside. It was definitely different from any other place we had been to before.

As for the food, it was average. I ordered a sandwich and a crab salad, which was unfortunately a bit too salty for my liking. However, the cookie and brownie that I also tried were delicious. The brownie was on the cakey side, but I quite enjoyed it. The only disappointment was that for the price we paid, I would have preferred some leaf lettuce instead of shredded.

One thing that I did appreciate about Pugzie's was their counter seating for solo diners. As someone who often eats alone, it was nice to have a spacious counter to comfortably hold my work and food tray.

The customer service was friendly and the place was kept clean. However, the overall experience was just okay. While I may return to try something different, I can't say that I will be craving their food anytime soon. But hey, to each their own!"

Our kids are super-curious and loved places like the Children's Museum right down the road.  There, we would visit a dozen times per year.  \n\nI think that this museum just feels tired and limited.  Even with all of the floors, there's just not a lot of sizzle to the exhibits.  \n\nA major metro like Phoenix should have a bigger, badder museum.  I guess this just goes to show why this State is ranked in the bottom 5 nationally in all things related to the education of children.  Too bad."

I have been to Hula's multiple times and have always loved it, but my recent experience left me extremely disappointed. As someone who just returned from a trip to Maui and was still craving the feeling of being in Hawaii, I thought Hula's would hit the spot. Boy, was I wrong.

The Mai Tai, which has always been the highlight of my visits, tasted completely different this time. It was overly sweet and lacked the perfect balance of flavors that I had come to expect. As a Mai Tai snob, I was appalled. I even had to question if they had changed the recipe or just had an inexperienced bartender.

As for the food, it was nothing special. I usually opt for fish dishes to keep up with the Hawaiian vibe, but even those were lackluster. The Mahi can be dry at times and while the Luau Pork is decent, I found it to be much more enjoyable in sandwich form. The appetizers were the only saving grace, but it's a shame that I had to rely on those to make up for the disappointing main courses.

I hate to do this, but I have to give a low rating. For a place that prides itself on its tropical, Hawaiian atmosphere, my experience definitely fell short. Don't get me wrong, I'll probably go back for the Mai Tai, but with lowered expectations. Beware of the hype and proceed with caution."
659,"We had the Orange Cafe Benny and Veracruz Omelet... Not impressed.\nThe coffee was horrible, either burnt or overly bitter, our waiter was mute or shy, barely spoke a word. \nAs for the dishes the \""Benny\"" was an odd mix of Boiled and Creamed egg mixed with too much onion and a bit of mushroom and bacon with sauce on top of bread... All I could taste was the onion and boiled egg. \nThe omelet was better, but the odd addition of celery to a otherwise decent salsa was confusing, ultimately overpowering the taste. \nThe save face on these plates was the potatoes, which were nicely cooked and spiced. \nFruit was mostly unexistent, just a slice of orange and melon was included. \nThe odd combinations failed to impress, and for $34 with tip for two, I don't think we'll be going back."

I had high hopes for this restaurant, hoping to escape the generic chain meals and try something new. Unfortunately, my experience was nothing short of disappointing as the service was consistently terrible. 

The waiter seemed uninterested in his job, opting to chat with his coworkers in the back bar area rather than attend to our table. Maybe he thought his fancy white apron and ponytail were enough to make up for his lack of effort. 

To add insult to injury, our drinks took an agonizing 10 minutes to arrive, and only after I had to personally track down our waiter to remind him of our order. And when our salads finally did come, we were left without any olive oil or balsamic dip for our bread. Meanwhile, the table next to us had an abundance of bread and dipping oil - talk about feeling neglected. 

As for the food, it was decent but definitely not worth the hefty price tag. We ordered simple dishes - a salad and a basic pizza - and even then, the flavors were nothing special. And to top it off, our glasses remained empty for far too long and we were never once checked on by our disinterested waiter. 

In the end, I couldn't bring myself to leave a tip for such terrible service. And when I kindly raised my concerns to the restaurant manager, I was met with little apology or attempt to make things right. Needless to say, there are plenty of other amazing places to eat in Las Vegas, so save yourself the disappointment and skip this one."

I was very disappointed with my recent experience at Einstein's. I was excited to try out their highly recommended bagels and was especially looking forward to trying their onion and chives flavor. However, my excitement quickly turned into frustration and annoyance. The bagels were nowhere near the quality that I had heard about and had seen on the menu. In fact, I couldn't even finish my bagel because it was so bland and lacked any flavor at all. But what really bothered me was seeing the table next to us, made up of mostly non-locals, receive a variety of delicious looking dishes that were not on the menu. When we asked our server about this, we were given a flimsy excuse about the size of our table and were told that those dishes were only for larger parties. This just seemed like a lazy and insulting way to handle our complaint, especially considering that we had specifically inquired about the same dishes that were served to the other table. It's clear that Einstein's needs to work on their customer service and not just cater to non-locals. As a local and a bagel lover, I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."
662,"Awful. Awful. Awful. Worst service I have ever had, bad food, cold food, overpriced. \n\nWhere do I start? We waited 20-25 minutes to get in for breakfast. It was the WORST service and food I have had in a long  time, and EXTREMELY overpriced (particularly considering the awful food and awful service).  My husband and I got mimosas (why not? we are on vacation) and they were $9 each.  We expected a large wine glass for our $9.  Instead, we received the smallest, tiniest champagne glass I have ever see.  It was a shot of champagne for $9. No thanks. I'll pass.  \n\nThen my husband and I got the eggs Benedict to eat.  He got the traditional and I got their special one.  All of the eggs were overcooked, 2 didn't even run out when you broke them open.  They were basically hard boiled eggs.  The sauce over them was tasteless and cold.  Everything, in fact, was cold and unseasoned.  It was awful.  \n\nThe service through the entire meal was awful but when we tried to pay the bill, we were ignored for at least 20 minutes.   We almost walked out and I have never walked out on a check.  When I finally got up to complain and get someone to take our credit card, the manager brought the check but did not ask how the food was or if everything was ok.  Even the management didn't care.  This is cafeteria food for $20+ per plate. There are farrrrr better places in Vegas and even in the paris to eat, for much much more reasonable of a price."

I've been coming to this restaurant for years and it used to be my go-to spot for authentic Middle Eastern cuisine. However, I have noticed a decline in quality and an increase in prices over the years. While the falafel and stuffed grape leaves are still delicious, they are not worth the steep prices. 

The falafel used to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, but now it's often undercooked and mushy. The grape leaves also seem to be smaller and less flavorful than they used to be. It's a shame because these were my favorite dishes here. Thankfully, the Shawarma Baladi Sandwich at Cedarland Deli & Grocery is just as good and at a more affordable price. 

I also have to mention that the service has been hit or miss. Sometimes the waitstaff is attentive and friendly, while other times they seem overwhelmed and uninterested. It's a gamble every time I visit. 

Despite my disappointment, I still occasionally come here when I have a strong craving for falafel or grape leaves. But I have to be in the mood to spend extra money for a subpar meal. I wish the prices were more reasonable and the quality remained consistent, then I would revisit regularly. Until then, I'll only come here on special occasions."

The only thing high-class about this place is the price tag. I was duped into thinking this would be a fancy dining experience in Vegas, but boy was I wrong. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was a complete joke. Our waiter disappeared halfway through the meal and we had to flag down someone else to ask for our wine. And don't even get me started on the carpet...it was truly an eyesore. Adding insult to injury, the pasta with clams was so salty it was practically inedible. Save your money and your taste buds, and take your business elsewhere. This faux expensive restaurant is nothing more than a joke."
666,"The food and drinks were good, but the service was beyond awful. Unfriendly waitresses were the norm. Plopping the menu's down on our table and leaving without a simple greeting or eye contact?

Will never recommend this place due to the wait staff and I am one that rarely complains or cringes when other people do at my table."

After being turned away from delivery and forced to drive 1.8 miles for pickup, I am not impressed with this location. The lack of effort and consideration for customers is quite disappointing. As someone who has experience in the food industry, I can confidently say that the customer service here is subpar. The fact that they would rather lose a customer's business than drive an extra couple of hundred yards shows a lack of dedication and laziness. It's no wonder they only have a two-mile radius for delivery. I would much rather support local businesses like Firehouse Subs who go above and beyond for their customers. Save your money and your time and order from a different location. Trust me, the speed at which Jimmy John's delivers will not make up for the disappointment in their service. Laziness is never a good look."

While the restaurant looked very nice and the service was good, my experience at this place was a bit disappointing. I found the prices to be too expensive for what I actually received. For instance, I ordered the lamb salad for $16 and was quite underwhelmed by the small portion and bland taste. The same goes for the lamb burger my partner ordered. The dish lacked flavor and did not match the high price tag. I also noticed that there weren't many affordable options for someone with a gluten-free diet like myself. Overall, I felt like this restaurant was too focused on maximizing profits rather than satisfying their customers' desires. Unfortunately, I left feeling unsatisfied and unlikely to return. While the restaurant may have a charming ambiance and good service, the food and prices just didn't meet my expectations."

""I recently stayed at this hotel with two of my closest friends and overall, it was a decent experience. The valet and bellman were friendly and attentive upon our arrival, which set a good tone for our stay. However, the check-in lines were a bit chaotic, though they moved quickly enough. Our room was clean and comfortable, but the towels did have a strange burnt smell. The casino was a bit smoky, but they did a good job masking the smell with scents. The location of the hotel was great and we were able to easily walk to all the shops and attractions on the strip. We even visited some local clubs, which were just a short cab ride away. The neighboring hotel, NYNY, was one of our favorites and we enjoyed the convenience of its location. The retail shops in Monte Carlo were also a plus, as we were able to pick up some last minute items for our nights out. While I would consider staying here again, I would definitely try to find a better deal on a room next time."""

That would have to be my biggest complaint. On a positive note, the inside and outside of the building  is normally clean and tidy. They have always gotten my food out fast, which normally would be a plus if I didn't have to go back to get the order fixed.

During my visit to Pittsburgh, I was excited to find out that I was only a short walk away from the Natural History Museum. Eager to escape the heat, I made my way over to the museum, eager to explore all it had to offer. Little did I know, this was a decision I would soon regret. \n\nUpon entering, I was struck by the beauty of the museum, but that quickly faded as I began to navigate my way through its halls. Despite hearing about the museum's connection to the art museum, I was disappointed to find that the layout was a bit confusing and not as straightforward as I had hoped. While some exhibits, like the dinosaurs, were easy to find, others, like the Egypt hall, seemed to be hidden away and took me far too long to locate. \n\nBut the struggle to navigate the museum was only the beginning. As I made my way through the exhibits, the only thing that caught my attention was the overpowering stench of what I can only describe as a sewage backup. And let's not forget about the dirt-like substance that seemed to be smeared on the walls and floors. It was disgusting and made me question the overall cleanliness of the museum. \n\nNeedless to say, I did not end up exploring the entire museum. The thought of spending any longer in that unsanitary environment was enough to make me leave. I can't believe this place passes for a reputable museum. I suggest avoiding this place at all costs and finding a cleaner, more enjoyable museum to visit instead. Trust me, even a homeless shelter would have better hygiene standards than this museum. "

Ryad is a well-located kiosk in the MJT food and restaurant area, right in the center by the east entrance and stairs leading to the parking. Despite its prime location, my experience here was mediocre. The rose flavoured lakoum, a popular Turkish delight, was just okay. I have had the real deal from Turkey, which was much fresher and had a richer taste. However, Ryad does offer a wide variety of Moroccan and Middle Eastern pastries, as well as stuffed pastry options. Although I didn't try them, I plan on coming back to check them out.

Unfortunately, my experience at Ryad was overshadowed by the lack of attentiveness from the staff and their seemingly rushed demeanor. On one occasion, they seemed to be in a hurry to close down, and on the other, they had already closed early. It seems that they only stay open for events or games, and once those are over, they shut it down. The food was also underwhelming and not something I would recommend. However, the kiosk does have a sports book desk if you're looking to place a bet and watch a game.

All in all, I would say that Ryad is an okay spot to catch a game, but I would not recommend it as a dining option. If you do decide to go, make sure to arrive early to avoid any disappointments with the timing of their closure."
673,"Our reservation was set for 7:30pm on a Saturday, we arrived to a nearly empty establishment with outdated d\u00e9cor and senior citizen to match. That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entr\u00e9e I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Cr\u00e8me Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again."

I've been a Cold Stone fan for years, but recently my visits to the AZ Center location have been less than satisfactory. This place used to be a cozy and welcoming spot, but now it's filled with disinterested and unprofessional employees. It's a shame because the ice cream is still delicious, but the vibe inside the store is enough to make me want to turn around and walk out. The employees here move at a snail's pace, and it's always a struggle to get their attention for anything beyond a basic scoop of ice cream. It's clear that the management is lacking, as the employees are allowed to lounge in the back and take phone breaks whenever they want. And don't even think about asking for a smoothie or anything that requires extra effort - you might as well be asking for a miracle. It's also worth mentioning that the staff here is quite unique - with girls sporting exaggerated fake nails and boys with teardrop tattoos under their eyes. It's a mystery how this place is still running, but I have a feeling it's not just ice cream that's being served here. Despite all of this, I still have a soft spot for Cold Stone, but the AZ Center location is definitely one to avoid. "

This restaurant may seem like a family-owned authentic Mexican joint, but don't be fooled. As soon as I walked in, I felt like I had been transported to a rundown diner in the 80s. The decor was outdated and the floors were sticky. I should have known from the start that this was not going to be a good experience. The food was mediocre at best, but the real issue was the service. The waiters seemed more interested in chatting with each other than taking our order. And when our food finally arrived, it was cold and bland. But the real kicker was when I found a long hair in my burrito. I couldn't believe it. I asked to see the manager, but they were nowhere to be found. It's clear that this place has no standards for cleanliness or customer service. Save your money and go somewhere else. Trust me, eating at this restaurant is not worth the risk of finding a hair in your food. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dive at all costs."

I raved all about it. \n\nWe were told the restaurant had been sold and there were many changes. None of which seemed to be for the better. The signature beef stroganoff was horrible. I was told the old owner/management would not disclose the recipe so that was the best they could do. The appetizer skewers were burnt and you couldn't even tell what kind of meat you were eating. The steaks were just steaks. Nothing to write home about. My son had the shrimp, which he said were tasty. There was just no atmosphere. No dining experience like before. It was just a restaurant. The service was so lacking. Our waitress didn't know what she was doing and we were completely ignored. Almost three hours in that place. We were told there was a new system in place and everyone was trying to get use to it. What??!!! Why do I care about a new system!  We paid well over two bills to be subjected to poor training and mismanagement. Oh and one more thing, this restaurant isn't a 21 and over establishment. So please hostesses, pull you dresses down just a tad. I don't like having to see the crotch of your underwear, if you're wearing any, as you strut around half dressed. I'm not a prude, granted it is Vegas, but not whilst I'm eating and certainly not in front of my two teenage children.

Let me start off by saying, I really wanted to like this place. My family and I are pizza lovers and are always on the lookout for new places to try. Unfortunately, Toppers did not live up to our expectations. We ordered two small 9-inch pizzas for dinner and were left feeling underwhelmed. The crust was average, the toppings were subpar, and the overall taste was just mediocre.

But what really put a damper on our experience was the service. Our waiter seemed disinterested and barely checked on us throughout our meal. When we asked for a refill on our drinks, it took forever to come. And when we asked for the check, it seemed like we were an inconvenience to our waiter. We had to practically beg for attention while we watched other tables get served promptly.

To top it all off, when we raised our concerns to the manager, his response was less than satisfactory. He seemed indifferent and unapologetic, almost as if our opinion didn't matter. It was clear that he had no intention of addressing our concerns and wanted us out of the restaurant as quickly as possible.

Overall, our experience at Toppers left a bad taste in our mouths. We were disappointed with the lackluster food and unprofessional service. And to think that we paid for this mediocre experience is just disheartening. I highly doubt we will be returning to this establishment anytime soon. With so many other pizza options in the area, I'm sure we can find a place that values their customers and takes pride in their food. Save yourself the hassle and find a better choice for your next pizza night."

I recently dined at the Scottsdale Road location of The Spotted Donkey and while I left feeling satisfied, I couldn't help but feel disappointed by the prices. The food was delicious - I highly recommend trying their signature margaritas and tableside chopped salad. However, the prices were a bit excessive, especially for lunch. As a self-proclaimed cheapskate, I struggled to justify paying nearly $15 for a salad with added chicken or shrimp. And let's not forget about their $15 martinis that came in a souvenir glass (which, let's be real, most of us can do without). Despite the tasty food and pleasant atmosphere, I couldn't help but think that there are much better options in the area that offer better value for money. So, while I won't completely discourage you from trying The Spotted Donkey, just be prepared to spend a little more than you'd expect."
680,"Went to Proper for pizza and beers around 5, and they were already pretty packed. We split a pizza and salad, both of which we're tasty, despite downtown level prices and portions. The crust has a great doughy chew despite being thin/brick oven, and I was a big fan of the carnivore toppings. \n\nHave to dock one star for service and one for beer price/selection. They only had two bartenders handling a large bar (beer/wine/cocktails) plus getting orders for the wait staff. Our bartender was friendly and efficient, but we waited over ten minutes each time we finished a round, and had to skip our last beer to get the check and run to a ballgame. He was absolutely swamped. \n\nBeer list was long but unimpressive. Focusing on regional beers is great, but four Yards taps is four too many, especially at $6/7 a pour. I'll pay $7 for something brought in from the West Coast etc, but not for middle of the road regional beers. Worth a second visit for a downtown pizza craving, especially if they add happy hour pricing."

I had high hopes for this restaurant, especially after hearing that the delivery would be quick. But my experience quickly went downhill from there. The only positive was that my order arrived earlier than expected. However, they managed to mess up the one dish I was looking forward to - the orange chicken. And it wasn't just a small mistake, they completely forgot to include it in my order. When I called to ask for it to be delivered, the woman on the phone actually laughed at me and suggested I just take store credit instead. Excuse me? I paid for my meal and I expect to receive all of it. 

Not only was the customer service lacking, but the quality of food was also subpar. I've had better Chinese food at Panda Express, and that's saying something. The fact that they laughed at my request for the missing dish just added salt to the wound. And to top it off, my order came without any forks or knives. Is this some kind of joke? 

I've had my fair share of restaurant mishaps, but this one definitely takes the cake. Not only did they mess up my order, but they also had the audacity to laugh at me and provide subpar service. Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back to this restaurant or any of its establishments. Save yourself the trouble and go to Panda Express instead."

If we didn't say anything, we would've been waiting longer. \n\nThey had a special performance for Valentines day which we opted to see for an additional fee per person. It was a nice show but service seemed to be halted due to it. 80% of the people there already had their meals. It took us 2 hours to have an appetizer (the crepe with scallops), cheese fondue which had an unbelievable amount of butter in and a dessert crepe which was delicious. We originally ordered the \""La Potence\"" but since it took over 45 minutes, we cancelled it. Turns out it was the right choice since the kitchen didn't even prepare it yet. \n\nCan't say I'd ever come back by choice as it seems they need practice for serving a full restaurant.

You and I were pretty good friends when we started to get to know each other, but then like an abusive ex gf, you started showing your bad points really quickly. I have been going to this place for months but after sampling other boba tea places around the area, I now know there are better places where customers are actually treated with respect. Why do I have to bring up respect when talking about a cafe? Because it has all to do with service. Or lack thereof in this case. \n\nThere are two wait staff members here, a boy and a girl, who always seem to be giving not only me but other customers a hard time when ordering drinks. I even experimented different ways to order drinks (Pointing to the drinks on the drink counter, speaking slowly and enunciating each word, learning Taiwanese (Okay, maybe not the last one but I might as well have)) to lower the aggravation or pissy meter off of these wait staff members. Nothing works. They will often get annoyed or angry that you can't get your order right the first time. I have worked front of the house in cafes before larger than this establishment and I have not once showed signs the level of discontent or disrespect these guys show. It's gotten from me being embarrassed thinking I made a mistake to being embarrassed that they don't know how to do customer service. Probably the only constructive criticism I can say is to retrain these two wait members or get a touch screen so you can punch in your own orders to save time, money, and customers. \n\nBut enough of the bad, the good is that their drinks are consistently good and there are some very good helpful members of their team like the older pudgy guy who usually mixes the drinks or the young short girl who always seem happy to have a job.\n\nI would give this place one star if it wasn't for the consistency of their food and drinks. Remember, people will go out to eat at places with good food and drink but they will only comeback if there is good service to match.\n\nMy advice? Why take the abuse? Try Volcano Tea House or Fresh Cup down the street. At least they won't chastise you for messing up your order or nag you on it."

The No. 1 Sushi Bar & Restaurant may have a flashy name, but don't be fooled - there's nothing special about this place. From the moment I walked in, I could tell that the staff couldn't care less about their customers. No warm welcomes, no friendly smiles, just an overall sense of indifference. And let me tell you, it only went downhill from there. 

I ordered the combination sashimi & sushi set, hoping to find some relief from my haggis and lamb shank filled days in Dunfermline. But instead, I was served cold, flavorless sashimi that tasted like it had been sitting out for days. And don't even get me started on the sushi. The California rolls were beyond disappointing - they were practically falling apart as I tried to eat them. I couldn't even finish my meal, which is saying a lot for a sushi lover like myself. 

But the worst part of all was the service. My server seemed annoyed that I had even bothered to come in and order something off their menu. When I asked for some tape to seal my box and attach the pre-paid label, he acted like I had just asked for a kidney. Maybe he thought they saw no profit from people using pre-paid labels, but at $3.00 a roll, it's not like I was asking for a free meal. 

In short, I would rather drive 45 minutes and pay for parking just to avoid ever stepping foot in this place again. The lack of customer service and subpar food make this a place to avoid at all costs. Trust me, there are plenty of other sushi restaurants in Edinburgh that will treat you like a valued customer, not an inconvenience. Save your money and your taste buds, skip No. 1 Sushi Bar & Restaurant."

Walking around this place, I couldn't help but feel like it was a disorganized flea market. There were rows of booths selling all sorts of useless trinkets and souvenirs. The only redeeming quality was the half-priced tickets booth, which came in handy for our night out in the city. However, that was the only useful thing we found here.

We decided to stop at one of the food kiosks for a quick bite before heading out. The options were limited, but we settled on some $2 tacos and pizza slices. While they were decent enough, they definitely didn't make up for the overall disappointment of this place.

But the real issue was the lack of any sort of customer service. The staff seemed annoyed and rushed, particularly when my friend and I were trying to navigate the chaos and figure out what we wanted. They were pushy and impatient, making the whole experience even more unpleasant.

Overall, I would say to avoid this place. It's not worth the time or money. You're better off finding other places to shop and eat in the city. Don't bother wasting your time here."

I had heard mixed reviews about this place and decided to give it a try, despite being intimated by the nerdy crowd outside. As I walked in, most of them were immersed in some sort of game, so I made my way to the store entrance. To my disappointment, there wasn't a wide selection of games and majority of the space was taken up by Warhammer and D&D merchandise. While I'm sure these games are popular, they weren't what I was looking for. And to top it off, no one bothered to greet or assist me during my visit. It was quite cramped and underwhelming. I can see how this place could be a paradise for some, but it definitely didn't live up to the hype for me. Maybe I'll stick to Imperial Games from now on."

I was really excited to finally try this restaurant after hearing great things and seeing how busy it always is. We decided to come on game day and it was definitely a let down. Despite the enticing smell of the smoker outside, the food was lackluster. My chicken wrap was dry and lacked flavor, and the teriyaki sauce was barely noticeable. The beer specials were the only saving grace. However, the atmosphere and service left much to be desired. Our server seemed more interested in watching the game than attending to our table, and it took forever to get refills. I was even more disappointed when I saw how small the portions were and how overpriced everything was. This place may be popular, but it's definitely not worth the hype or the high prices. Save your money and go somewhere else. "

I had high hopes when I walked into this place on a quiet Saturday night, but boy was I disappointed. From the moment I walked in, I couldn't shake the feeling that this place was hiding something. It's like they want to be a restaurant one minute and a night club the next - talk about indecisive.

But the biggest disappointment was the food. It was just...okay. Nothing special, nothing memorable. In fact, it was so bland I could barely remember what I ate. And let's talk about the service - or lack thereof. Our waitress moved like a ninja, dodging tables and disappearing before we could even ask for more water. It's like she didn't want to be seen. And given the shady atmosphere of this place, I can't say I blame her.

Do yourself a favor and skip this place. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that actually want to be seen and have decent food. Don't waste your time or money here."
691,"I've came here several times and EVERY TIME its not dusted, washed and vacuumed all the way! and their slow. \nSeriously, its waste of your money. I get so annoyed when they come by where I work to sell coupons. I tell them their services are not worth my money."

Upon arriving at this farmers market, I was delighted to see that McClendon Farms had returned. I used to visit this market regularly a few years ago, and it just wasn't the same without their top-notch produce. But now, they are back and better than ever! Their organic options are clearly marked, making it easy for health-conscious shoppers like myself. And to top it off, they occasionally have a chef on hand to offer cooking suggestions for their unique produce items. Now that's a level of customer service that I can get behind. \n\nBut McClendon Farms isn't the only highlight of this market. The other vendors have also stepped up their game. With more tents offering everything from fresh flowers to homemade bread and jams, there is something for everyone here. And it's not just about the food - the atmosphere is wonderful, with people strolling around with their coffee and pastries, and even dogs are welcome to join in on the fun. It's truly a charming and vibrant place to visit. \n\nAs much as I love this market, there are a few things that keep me from giving it a higher rating. The prices can be a bit steep, but the quality makes up for it. And unfortunately, they don't always have the best selection if you go later in the day, as some of the popular items tend to sell out quickly. But if you plan ahead and arrive early, it is definitely worth the trip. Plus, the fact that they now accept credit cards without any hassle is a huge bonus. Overall, a great market with plenty to offer, just be prepared for a few minor inconveniences. "
693,"My friends and I went here for after hours and it was so-so. The lounge itself is nice, but small! Music was louder than any other club I went to while I was in Vegas. There was no cover since it was after hours and I actually got a free drink by talking to the bartender for long enough. Fun spot for late night, and I had heard that Carmen Electra was there earlier that night!"
694,"

The Good: This restaurant serves up some seriously impressive portions, especially when it comes to their citrus salmon salad. The perfectly cooked salmon paired with a tasty dressing is definitely a standout dish. 

The Bad: While the food may be delicious, be prepared to spend a little extra on your meal. The prices can range from $10-$20, but don't let that deter you! The small menu does limit your options, and some may find it lacking variety. 

Try: Definitely give the citrus salmon salad a try, it's a dish that won't disappoint. 

Don't Try: If you're planning on visiting this place during busy lunch or dinner hours, you may want to reconsider. With plenty of other options nearby, save this spot for another time when you can fully appreciate the food without the long wait. Overall, a decent meal with good company."

We chose to have dinner at MIX during our stay at the Bellagio, hoping to have a luxurious and memorable experience. Sadly, our expectations were not met. The view of the sunset and the strip from our table was beautiful, but that was the only highlight of our dining experience. We opted for the Alain Ducasse classics menu, which included the signature tenderloin. While the dishes were all tasty, we were disappointed that the sommelier did not describe each wine pairing for us with the courses. This is something we have experienced at other high-end restaurants and it added to our overall disappointment. Additionally, our waiter seemed overly eager to convince us of the quality of the food and the reputation of Alain Ducasse. We came to MIX because we already know and appreciate his talent.

To add to our frustration, the service at the Bellagio was subpar. We encountered rude and unprofessional staff, and even had issues with our room being charged multiple times without our consent. Dead bugs in the room and being ignored by staff only added to our dissatisfaction. Our first trip to Vegas was not enjoyable, mainly due to our stay at the Bellagio. We had also reserved a table at the infamous Bank Nightclub, but were disappointed yet again by their unreasonable prices and treatment. We were forced to leave with security when we only wanted to purchase one bottle.

In conclusion, while the view at MIX and the tasty dishes were enjoyable, the lackluster service at the Bellagio and their associated establishments overshadowed our overall experience. We would not recommend staying at the Bellagio for anyone looking for exceptional service. "

As soon as we saw the charming storefront and inviting atmosphere, we knew we had to check out this hidden gem. Plus, the added bonus of a cafe option sealed the deal. The butternut squash soup was divine - creamy, flavorful, and the perfect comfort on a snowy day. My friend and I also shared the mac and cheese, which was equally delicious. The store was filled with unique, one-of-a-kind items that we couldn't resist browsing through. However, our experience was marred by the service. Our water glasses were left empty for extended periods and our food arrived at different times, creating a disjointed dining experience. It's possible that the restaurant is experiencing some growing pains, as it seems fairly new. But with such potential, I hope they can work out those kinks and improve in the future. As much as we loved the food and atmosphere, the lackluster service brings our overall experience down. Maybe we'll give it another chance in the future, but for now, we'll have to take our business elsewhere. "
697,I had brunch here and found the food to be pretty average. I am not sure if I was supposed to order a specific breakfast item but I went with the daily special omelet which had filet. It tasted fine but wasn't anything to write home about. The omelet was actually quite bland and lacked seasoning. I also didn't enjoy the beignets as they were way too sweet and weren't moist enough.

When a friend recommended this place to me during my visit to Madison, I was excited to try it out. I had heard great things about the food and was eager to experience it for myself. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The food had no flavor and the service was terrible. The decor was also quite unappealing, with a metal rod and speaker in the center of the dining room. It was not the dining experience I was expecting, and it was honestly one of the worst food experiences I've had in a long time. I couldn't understand how so many people were enjoying their meals here. Maybe it was just a bad night, or the regular chef was unavailable, but either way, I was not impressed. Overall, it was an okay experience, but I definitely will not be returning. "
699,"Friends took us there last night and all of us left fairly annoyed.  Admittedly it was very crowded but at $75 - $100 (after tax, tip, etc.) a person, they should be able to staff accordingly.  They sat our group of 8 in a back corner.  It looked like some sort of conference room as there was a projection screen above our head.   We sat and ordered drinks fairly quickly and then were directed to the salad bar to get started.  The salad bar was decent, however, the grilled vegetables were either overcooked and mushy or not cooked long enough.   The other items were more than decent...in all fairness.   Now for the meat.   They give you these little table markers which indicate to the servers when you are ready to try the meat selections.   It started off with a vengeance of servers coming to us to offer their wares.  However, after the first wave and only having tried a few items of what the restaurant offers - no one came.  We kept having to ask over and over to send someone with the other items and we kept getting the same meats offered to us.  So needless to say there were huge gaps in between our meal, all of the sides got cold, we had to ask for water a few times, no one came to check our bread...Coffee refill took over 10 minutes.   We were forced to leave a $70 tip due to policy but really we were borderline outraged.  Our poor friends that brought us were so embarrassed and angry.  It was a special occasion.  Living in this area - we have hundreds of fine dining choices.  Next time, we will try one of the others.   By the way, the meats themselves were hit and miss.  Some were over salty, some fatty, some over-charred, some perfect.  Ambiance is very nice though.  $500 tab - not worth it.\n\nC.L.\nGilbert, AZ"

My husband and I have visited this restaurant multiple times due to its convenient location near our boat dock, but each time we can't help but question our decision to return. The food is decent and reminds us of home cooking, definitely better than typical chain restaurants. The view of the lake is also a nice touch, but the overall experience is dragged down by the horrendous service. 

We arrive and are met with staff members who blatantly avoid making eye contact as we wait to be seated. Eventually, the manager or owner (I can never tell) acknowledges us with a half-hearted ""be right with you"". This turns out to be far from the truth. As we are seated, we are told that our server will be with us shortly. Yet, we are left sitting there for what feels like an eternity. We even witness other servers sitting down to eat while completely ignoring the few tables in the restaurant. 

One time, the frustration reached its peak when I had to walk up to the register where the manager was fiddling with something to ask for some coffee. Instead of kindly accommodating my request, I received a rude and snappy response of ""your server will be right with you"". Really? You couldn't even bring us some coffee? 

The saving grace for this place is the food and the view. But the service is so bad that it's hard to justify coming back. It's a shame because if they could improve in that area, it would be a hidden gem worth revisiting. For now, I think we'll explore other options such as Soba or Kaya. Maybe someday we'll give it another chance, but it's definitely not at the top of our list. "
701,"Caribbean Fusion is good, but needs a little menu tweaking. \n\nI went there totally expecting beef patties on the menu. After I already ordered my Jerk Pork, I asked if they would eventually serve them. The other server (not my server) said...\""oh, we have them\"". Huh?? Where? They certainly weren't on the menu or mentioned when I ordered. All I really wanted was a couple beef patties, some plantains and genuine ginger beer! I ordered the beef patties (abandoned my jerk pork) and ate the plantains I ordered with my pork dish. The patties were delish and so were the plantains. The jerk pork was flavorful but a little on the tough side. \n\nSimply put, the menu was great with the Jamaican dishes. They went awry by adding Italian style pasta dishes and salads with no Jamaican flare, American side dishes....like corn on cob, baked potato and french fries. \n\nThey're not super busy yet, and could probably do better by narrowing the selection to a few stellar and genuine Jamaican dishes. Oh, by the way, the website is www.jamicanfusions.com (Fusion with an \""s\"", unlike the spelling of the restaurant). \n\nOn the lighter side, I know a great Mojito, and theirs are fantastic!!! \n\nBon Appetite!"

During our recent trip to Las Vegas, my friends and I decided to watch the Criss Angel show at the Luxor. Unfortunately, the show was a major disappointment and felt like a waste of money. However, our time at the Luxor was redeemed by our visit to Company, a restaurant inside the hotel. The hostess was kind enough to give our group of 10 free entrance to the club LAX after our dinner. As a group of guys, we were pleasantly surprised by this gesture as it's not very common for guys to get free entry, especially for petite Asian guys like myself who can't handle much alcohol. It seemed like the club was struggling and desperate for customers. But let's not dwell on the club, let's talk about Company. The food was surprisingly delicious, and the service was great. I highly recommend trying their Kobe sliders on sweet Hawaiian bread, spiced fries, and the pork sandwich - they were all mouthwatering! However, the prices were a bit steep, and for the same amount of money, we could have gotten better food elsewhere. Overall, our experience at Company was good, but not worth the high price. I wish we had gone to a more affordable option instead, but at least we got a free entrance to the club."

This mall has definitely seen better days. With the addition of Costco, Walmart, and Super Target, it seems like they are trying to compensate for the lack of foot traffic. Unfortunately, it falls short of the premier shopping destination it once was. The surrounding neighborhood has definitely changed and the mall doesn't seem to cater to the previous demographics anymore. The only saving grace is the Costco food court, where you can get a decently priced meal without a membership. However, the other dining options were underwhelming, with bland salads and overpriced drinks in tiny portions. It's a shame to see this once great mall struggling to stay afloat. Hoping for better days ahead but for now, I can only give it a mediocre rating."
706,"I expected a lot more from a dish that is the namesake of a restaurant. That's some greasy, flavorless fish, CFT. For shame. While I commend you for giving me a lot of food, it simply was not good.\n\nI also have an issue with the corn salsa that come with the chips at the table. I love corn salsa IN a dish. But, it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips. \n\nThe kernels...they were...everywhere."
707,I'll never go here again. I order the vegetarian sandwich to be delivered. The delivery guy shows up with no change which means I either have to turn away the food of pay $10 for the stupid thing. Then it was missing avocado.

708,"We have tried this place multiple times. Drink prices are high. Last lunch experience they messed up a salad and chic strips. How does that happen? Salad was missing items. Strips were freezer burnt and came out dry and cold. Also had chili which was tasty, but no cheese. No cheese on chili?  C'mon!"

Unfortunately, I had high hopes for this place, but it ended up being just average. The prices for kid's meals were a steep $5, and my daughter's portion of French toast and a drink was definitely not worth the money. My BLAT sandwich was tasty, but it wasn't served on the promised Texas toast and instead came on wheat bread. My husband's hot dog was decent, but the bun was dry and buried under a mound of grilled onions.

We found the service to be slow, although our server was very nice and friendly. It's a shame because we were really looking forward to this meal, but it fell short of our expectations. Perhaps we'll give it another try in the future, but for now, we probably won't be returning anytime soon."
710,"Very disappointing.  Big smiles with air brains....the window clerk screwed up an order ahead of us because she failed to read the slip three times in a row. The California Burger was like a cow pie sort of style, with an onion thicker then the meat slab.  The burgers were cold because the tomatoe and onion were so large, over powering the meat slab.  It was like a cold picnic including hard, cold, French fries.  I should have figured when the order was handed to me and the bag was not hot.  I am disappointed to see yet another business that will be short lived.  Sadly, I have already noticed the swing of business slowing :(."

Our experience at this restaurant was truly disappointing. Despite being the only table in the back section, our food took forever to arrive and we had to constantly ask for drink refills. My friend's steak was overcooked and my Reuben sandwich was lacking in flavor. To make matters worse, our server seemed more interested in boasting about her bathroom break and another server was busy talking about his acting experiences. But the biggest disappointment of all was the blatant racism and discrimination we experienced. As the only Hispanics in the restaurant, we were completely ignored the entire time and only received attention once we were leaving and complained about the poor service. It's a shame that in this day and age, such behavior is still considered acceptable in some establishments. We will definitely not be returning to this place and would not recommend it to anyone. "
712,"I love this place, Paris (the actual city) is one of my favorites in the world, and this hotel really does a decent job capturing its essence. Aside from the aesthetics this place is a huge pain in the Brie rind! My cell service is horrible, there is a modem in our room but a $15 per day charge for wifi (not to mention is only available on one device even after paying and horrible service), the cable is shabby and lacking of the most popular basic cable channels, and room service is full of fees and bogus charges. We are here on business and supposed to be given Diamond Club access but it will take them 3-4 days to \""process\""??? our info? Am I wrong to see that as completely ridiculous? And I know my cell service isn't the hotels fault but if I was allowed wifi I don't think my cell service would be such an issue. I shouldn't have to be dealing w my cell provider while away on business in Vegas. I feel almost trapped and kept from all basic conveniences in order to be lured downstairs into the casino and do not feel that my needs as a guest away from home have been considered at all. Also as stated, being here on business for a full week I would like to take it easy and relax being able to watch regular cable tv as I would back home after a full day of work. I feel at over $150 a night on the Vegas strip that it isn't far fetched to expect what the local Motel 6 offers and some."

I was excited to try out the Stratosphere during our quick, 2 day trip to Vegas. However, I have to say I was disappointed by the location. It was quite a distance from the main area of the Strip and we had to pay $20 for a taxi each time we wanted to go to the other end. But the room itself was decent, we were on the 24th floor and it was quiet. The bed was comfortable, but the bathroom was split and very small. We were hoping for a coffee maker in the room, but unfortunately, there wasn't one.

The hotel itself was not as crowded as other Strip hotels, which was nice if you just wanted to gamble. We didn't get a chance to see any of the shows, but we did check out the thrill rides, which were pretty scary and entertaining. The restaurant selection was mediocre at best, but we did enjoy the Air Bar on the 107th floor.

All in all, if you're looking for a clean and decently priced room close to the Strip, the Stratosphere is a good option. Just be prepared to spend some extra money on transportation and don't expect too much from the restaurants."

After hearing rave reviews from my friends about this place, I decided to give it a try. The restaurant itself has a unique vibe and watching the noodles being made right in front of us was definitely a cool experience. But unfortunately, the language barrier proved to be a bit of an issue. The owners were incredibly friendly and recommended some of their specialty dishes, but the communication was a bit difficult. Nonetheless, I decided to try some of their signature dishes and was pleasantly surprised. The beef noodle soup had a tantalizing blend of spices and the tomato egg noodle soup had a delicious hint of sweetness. And can we talk about the vegetable dumplings for a second? Not only were they tasty, but the presentation was unique and impressive. So in terms of quality and flavor, this place definitely hits the mark. However, I couldn't help feeling like they were pushing us to order more than we wanted. The constant reminders to order more food definitely put a damper on the overall experience. And the location, while charming in its own way, is not the most convenient for me. So while I would recommend this place to those willing to venture a bit out of their comfort zone, it's not something I would go out of my way for. Solid 4.5 stars."
716,"I spent almost an hour and a half waiting for an oil change that I had an appointment for at 10a on a weekday. There only two other people there that I could see and both waited over 2 hours (one was just getting two tires done). \n\nFull disclosure: I was redeeming a Groupon. I understand this is a tricky balance for businesses to make it worth the extra business deal sites bring in, but an extra long wait can be dealt with by having staff that doesn't treat you like you're the one making their life difficult just for taking them up on their offers.\n\nIt's hard to find a good shop, but this isn't it.

We went to this club on a Friday night and let me tell you, it was not a good experience. First of all, the club was extremely crowded, to the point where it was almost impossible to move around. The main bar was a disaster - it was so packed that people were basically locked in shoulder to shoulder. It seemed like there was no organization or control, as we were constantly being told we couldn't stand in certain areas. Honestly, it felt more like a crowded and disorganized mess than a fun night out. And to top it off, the club itself was nothing special - just a square room with two bars and a DJ, nothing to write home about. Overall, I was disappointed and won't be returning. Save yourself the hassle and find a better club with more space and better vibes. "
720,I went there after reading the reviews but the place kind of disappointed me. It was dinner time but the place was empty. Only a waiter for the whole restaurant. Service was slow. We ordered lamb and catch of the day. The fish is almost ok if I didn't taste the gallbladder. And the lamb just sucks for we can taste the meat is not fresh. Will never go there again.
721,It's a good deal. I have stayed there twice. I was disappointed with their pool side service - over memorial weekend they only had two bartenders and lines were extraordinary long to get a drink. Poolside waitresses were very friendly but it appeared that they were getting paid to socialize instead of wait on guests which I found odd. It seemed like the pool scene needed more management on hand to make sure people were indeed getting  the service we were paying for with the resort fee. Needs improvement on it's customer service but nighly rate is indeed a good deal.

I can't believe I was ever excited to try this place. The hype and good reviews must have been fake because my experience was a complete nightmare. First off, our waiter was clueless and it took him forever to bring chocolate milk for my son. When I asked him what was taking so long, he had the audacity to say that it was a lot of work. Are you kidding me? It's just chocolate milk, not rocket science. And to make things worse, there were only two other people in the restaurant at the time. How hard could it be to provide decent service? 

Then came the food. Let's just say the pizza was barely cooked and to top it off, we found a long hair in it. Disgusting! They took it back and made us another one, but by that point, our appetites were ruined and we couldn't even enjoy it. And to add insult to injury, the manager couldn't even be bothered to come out and apologize to us. As if that wasn't enough, they still had the audacity to make us pay for part of the meal. Excuse me? If I were the manager, I would have comped the entire meal and then some for the terrible experience we had. 

Oh, and did I mention that my whole family is now taking turns on the toilet after eating at this place? I'm currently writing this review while clutching a heating pad to my stomach. The pizza was the worst I have ever had, and the service was beyond terrible. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this place. I wish I could give it zero stars because one star is still too much for this terrible excuse for a restaurant. Save your money and your stomach and go somewhere else. Consider yourself warned. "

I recently visited this store with hopes of finding a unique piece of jewelry. Upon entering, I noticed that their selection was quite limited. I perused through the items and found some to be of decent quality, but nothing stood out to me. As I was about to leave, I spotted a 14k white gold ring with a half carat diamond and 2/3 ctw in natural untreated blue sapphires. Hoping to make an offer, I approached the staff who were friendly and willing to assist. However, when I presented the ring, they quickly dismissed it without even making an offer. While they were not rude, I was disappointed that they were not more willing to negotiate. Overall, the experience was average and the selection was underwhelming. I may return to see if they have any new items, but I won't hold my breath."

I stopped by this place on a Tuesday night, excited for their $4 martinis deal. The atmosphere was great and the service was quick, we even got the Angry Fries to start off our meal. They were delicious and definitely lived up to their name. YUM. When it was time for the main course, I went with the Northern Pittsburger. I have to admit, I was disappointed with the size of the burger. Being a girl, I'm not a fan of giant, obscenely sized patties and this burger was borderline too big for me. I had to take the bun top off and eat it with a knife and fork to get to all the toppings. It's a great concept, but the execution fell short for me. Some toppings were lost in the overwhelming amount of meat. I couldn't even taste or see the coleslaw and dressing that was supposed to come with it. Maybe if I were to order it again, it would be put together better... but I'm not sure I want to risk it. And for $8.95, I expected a little more. On the bright side, the coleslaw side dish was the star of the meal. It was just the right amount of mayo and reminded me of my favorite KFC coleslaw. The decor was also nice and the big-screen TVs made it a great spot to catch a game. Overall, my experience was just okay. Maybe I'll come back for the martinis, but I wouldn't order the burger again. "
727,"\""Meh\"" is a very good word to describe my experience with Postino East. The wait time we were given was 20 minutes - which turned into 50 minutes. We were given really awkward seating - a couch that was shared with a couple (it could have been detached, I'm not sure why they insisted on pushing everything together). \n\nThere were flies EVERYWHERE. Hang bags of water above doorways - flies won't go under anywhere they can sense water above them. Or let them crawl all over the food, as Postino seems to prefer.\n\nThe food was okay. It was very affordable though. The waitstaff is also very nice and polite, and despite the busyness of the morning, prompt.\n\nI'm not sure why they chose to have way more outdoor seating than indoor seating in a city that's unbearably hot for a good part of the year. Seems like a waste of space to me.\n\nOverall I'd like to visit for dinner or lunch. The food is affordable and well-made, but their handling of crowds can definitely be improved."

My experience at this baby furniture store was a complete disappointment. Despite all the positive reviews I had read, it was nothing like what I had expected. First of all, the location was hard to find and once I did, the storefront was bland and uninviting. As I walked in, there was no one to greet me, no one to ask if I needed help. I was left to wander around the store aimlessly, unsure of where to even begin.

After some time, I finally stumbled upon an employee who seemed more interested in scrolling through their phone than helping customers. When I asked for their assistance, they seemed annoyed and did not even know where the item I was looking for was located. Eventually, they grudgingly led me to the section, only to find that they were out of stock. What kind of baby furniture store doesn't have inventory of a popular item?

As I looked around the store, I noticed that everything was overpriced and outdated. It seemed like they were trying to pass off used items as new. The overall atmosphere was dreary and uninviting. And don't even get me started on the lack of cleanliness. The employees were too busy talking amongst themselves to bother wiping down the merchandise or even sweeping the floor. Who wants to buy baby products from a dirty store?

Overall, this place needs a major overhaul. From the lack of customer service to the outdated and overpriced products, I was thoroughly disappointed. This is definitely not a store I would recommend to anyone looking for quality baby furniture. Save yourself the trouble and find another store. Trust me, it's not worth the hassle."

I recently visited this chain restaurant for the first time, and unfortunately, it will also be my last. While the food portions were indeed generous, I couldn't help feeling underwhelmed by the taste. As someone who appreciates a good, authentic meal, I found the food here to be a bit cheesy, both literally and figuratively. Plus, I couldn't shake the feeling that everything was a bit too cookie-cutter, lacking any real personality or flare. And speaking of cookies, I made the mistake of ordering the ""pizza cookie"" based on the recommendation of our server. Not only was it far from the ""delicious"" dessert she described, but it also took forever to arrive at our table. In fact, the wait for everything here seemed to be a recurring theme. The wedding soup I ordered, which I had higher hopes for given its rave reviews, took an absurdly long time to come out. And even when it did, the meatballs were subpar, to say the least. But perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the atmosphere - although, to be fair, I wasn't expecting much from a chain restaurant. Overall, save yourself the trouble and find a more authentic, less cheesy dining experience."

We were excited to attend the comedy show at Brad Garrett's Comedy Club during our visit to Vegas. Unfortunately, we were let down by the overpriced drinks and popcorn, as well as the servers wearing tight outfits that seemed more fitting for a Hooters rather than a comedy club. But we were willing to overlook those minor details when the main act, Tom Rhodes, took the stage. His deadpan humor had us laughing non-stop and feeling like we were witnessing comedy as high art. However, our bubble of enjoyment was soon burst when we ordered food. The chicken ceaser salad I received was a complete disaster. The chicken was dry and unappetizing, and there was no dressing to be found. When I asked for a manager, they were supposedly too busy in the back to come address our concerns. The whole experience was a huge disappointment, and we will not be returning. Save your money and skip this place."

I recently visited this place and I have to say, I was extremely disappointed. Despite the fun and relaxed atmosphere, there were a few red flags that left a sour taste in my mouth. First of all, the prices listed on the menu were not accurate and ended up being much higher than expected. And to make matters worse, they don't even serve food after a certain time, which seems irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I mean, have they never heard of drunk driving? But from the looks of it, they seem to love it here in Arizona.

Coming from Portland, the ""microbrew capital of America"", I am used to reasonable prices for a pint of beer. And let me tell you, I was shocked when my bill came and I was charged $9 for a pint. And this wasn't even a specialty beer, just a basic one recommended by the guy next to me. And to top it off, the alcohol percentage was only 5.9%, which is pretty standard for a Budweiser. So not only was I paying double the price, but I was also getting less buzz for my buck. And when I brought it up to the staff, they didn't even try to make it right.

I was really hoping to enjoy my time here, but the prices and poor service left a bad taste in my mouth (literally and figuratively). I definitely won't be coming back, which is a shame because I loved the live music and laid-back vibe. My advice to anyone thinking about visiting this place: save your money and go somewhere else where you'll actually get your money's worth. Trust me, you'll thank me later."
732,"Sam Woo is practically a household name in Southern California, much like Panda Express would be in most cities.  There are dozens of them all over Southern California, from Monterey Park to Orange County.  I used to go to the one in Irvine quite often, and loved that they had \""on-demand\"" Peking Duck.  Most Chinese restaurants make you order it 24 hours ahead of time, but here you can get it whenever you want.  Some of the Sam Woo's are BBQ, some are seafood, but all of them serve traditional Hong Kong style Chinese food.  \n\nThe Sam Woo in Las Vegas is a BBQ restaurant, which means they have the Peking Duck on-demand.  This is my favorite part about this Sam Woo. They also have a lot of other BBQ items, such as BBQ spare rib and Chickens.  These can be either bought at the sit-down restaurant, or at the counter at the front of the restaurant.  \n\nThe restaurant is always pretty busy, but they handle the crowd well, and always have room for new tables.  I really enjoy their Hong Kong style crispy noodles, and their Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I also like the Pork Chop with Salt & Pepper.  \n\nThe reason I give Sam Woo's in Las Vegas a 3-star review is because it does not live up to the hype of the southern California restaurants.  I have found that the one out here in Las Vegas is hit or miss, having had very mediocre food on several occasions, while also having the typical great Sam Woo cuisine on severl other occasions.  This is what left me at 3 stars.  If they were consistent, it would be a 4-5 star, but until I consistently get the Sam Woo quality, they will never earn the other stars.  \n\nThis being said, I would suggest Sam Woo for anyone looking for great Peking Duck or Chinese BBQ.  There are not many other places in town that do it as well as them."
733,"I met a good sized group of people in the evening due to the food and drink specials available during the summer. Dollar tacos and two dollar drafts including imports. Whoa!  Great deal and the food wasn't half bad. \n\nSo why two stars?  They were understaffed that day. That is something that I understand and can roll with. Not a problem.  It took 10-15 minutes before the server noticed my gesturing. Eventually I placed a dinner order.  I had ordered a beer and 15 minutes later I made mention of it to the server. I just thought she forgot. Her response was completely uncalled for. Harsh tone, reactionary word choice, scowl...  I asked the table if I came off rude or something. No, I was apparently quite nice. Not only did I feel like walking out, everyone at the table was looking around wondering what the heck just happened. Someone a few people down said \""oh, yeah. That's why we never come here.\""  \n\nWe were a polite, hungry, and thirsty group with ages ranging between 20-60.  The staff made us feel like an intrusion as my simple question wasn't the only time we were snapped at and dumbfounded by our treatment. \n\nThe tip was added into the bill. I still gave her a dollar on top of the included gratuity.  She ended up with a 30% tip from me. That is likely the only time I step foot in that place. I was treated like an inconvenience. Trash.  I would have ordered a few more beers. I stopped at one because of the ridiculousness. \n\nFood, drink, and price was great. The staff is the worst. \n\nThe.  Worst."

I have to say, I was a bit disappointed with my recent visit to this bakery. Don't get me wrong, the chocolate croissants were still delicious, but they were definitely made differently than what I was used to. The ratio of chocolate to fluffiness was definitely off, with more chocolate and less of that airy, buttery croissant goodness. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed them, but they just weren't the same. 

Another downside of my visit was the fact that the place was quite crowded by 10am. We arrived around that time and had to wait quite a while for a table. It seems like this place is a popular spot for breakfast, so I would definitely recommend coming in earlier if you want to avoid the rush. 

On the bright side, I did really enjoy the breakfast selection here. It had that homey, cafe vibe that I love. The only downside was that the toppings weren't labeled, unlike another bakery I frequent in Blakeney. It was a bit of a struggle trying to figure out what was what. 

The staff here were incredibly friendly and accommodating, and one of the servers even apologized for the limited flavors available. As it turns out, the morning staff hadn't made backup batches (which they're supposed to do) and the equipment kept breaking down. I appreciate their transparency, but it was definitely a let down to not have a wider selection to choose from. 

Overall, I probably wouldn't make a special trip to come here again, but if I happen to be in the area and in need of some breakfast, I wouldn't mind stopping by. It does have a cozy atmosphere, but the limited flavors and crowds can be a bit of a turn off. "
735,"The spread is impressive, and most of the dishes were executed well and solid, but it didn't quite have the wow factor. Nothing quite had the creative spazazz. They have a bunch of different salads, most of which are of the creamy dressing variety. The kale salad could have benefited from massaging the kale a bit more so that the kale is less fibrous. The cheeses were good. I also thought that the mussels and bone marrow was good. However, some of the bone marrow pieces were inedible. They were hard, just like bone. Perhaps they hadn't been cooked down enough? They have a large meat counter - prime rib, bone marrow, sausage, as well as an Asian inspired section. The desserts spread is also impressive. I really liked their pistachio gelato, but wasn't as impressed by the salty peanut one - that one tasted like peanut butter, which I love, but a little bit less in gelato form. \nOver all, it's an experience, but maybe not mind-blowing?"

We had high hopes for this steakhouse, especially with the decent reviews we saw online. However, our experience was far from satisfactory. We arrived for our reservation at 7pm on a Tuesday and were seated promptly, but that was the only thing that went smoothly that night.

We ordered our drinks and were disappointed to wait 15 minutes for them to arrive. And that was only the beginning of our troubles. We informed our server that we were in a rush as we had tickets to a show at 8:30pm. But it seemed like our urgency fell on deaf ears.

The Caesar salad was the only thing worth mentioning about our meal. The side dishes were decent, but the steaks were a letdown. My filet was a mediocre 5 out of 10, while my wife's bone-in ribeye was a much better option. And let's not forget the lava cake, which was just as disappointing as the steak. It seemed like the only thing this restaurant had going for it was the ambiance, but that wasn't enough to make up for the subpar food and service.

To make matters worse, our server failed to apologize for the delay or the incorrect order. It was clear that she was either ineffective or just plain incompetent. And to top it all off, we were still charged for our meal, despite the manager's attempt to appease us by comping it. Needless to say, this place is not worth a special night out.

I was excited to try this place because everything on the menu looked so tasty, but unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The service was slow and unenthusiastic, despite there only being a few tables and servers. It took over 10 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us and ask for our drink orders. And when my order finally arrived, it was not at all what I was expecting. The lobster grilled cheese was just a slightly toasted sandwich with barely melted cheese and a strange lobster and cream cheese mixture. The only saving grace was the lobster mac and cheese that I tried from my friend's order. But even that couldn't make up for the poor service and underwhelming food. And to top it off, the people at the table next to us warned us that they had been waiting over an hour for their food. That's just unacceptable. Needless to say, we won't be coming back here. In fact, we ended up going to a different restaurant down the street, Archis Thai Bistro, where we received great service and delicious food in less than 30 minutes. Save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else. "

I have been a loyal customer of Figaro's for over 5 years now, and I have always been satisfied with the fantastic haircuts and experiences I have had with Russell. However, my recent visit left me less than impressed. I arrived at the shop and was greeted by the usual wait time - which is absolutely ridiculous. It's clear that Russell has a lot of returning customers, but the wait can be a bit much. This time, I didn't have the luxury of waiting all day for our haircuts, so Russell recommended that we see another barber. Well, let's just say I could have gotten a better haircut at Great Clips. 

I reached out to Russell afterwards to express my dissatisfaction and to request a fix and a refund. Unfortunately, the other barber, Mike, could not care less about customer service. In fact, he started to raise his voice and act like a complete idiot, yelling across the shop to see if Russell would answer the phone. As our conversation continued, it became clear that Mike had no intention of providing any sort of courtesy or customer satisfaction. In the end, I was so frustrated that I drove down to the shop to express my anger in person. 

I have to give Russell and the rest of the Figaro's shop 5 stars for their usual great customer service and complimentary refreshments. However, Mike gets a big, fat zero. He shouldn't even have the privilege of working at such a great establishment. Paying $65 for haircuts for my two boys and myself, I would expect to receive exceptional customer service, especially when things don't go as planned. Until Mike is no longer an employee at Figaro's, I will not be returning."

I haven't found a product I truly enjoy, everything sort of tastes like a chalky, crumbly version of a Pillsbury product. The bread is also dense (I've had gluten-free bread that isn't) and costs way too much - its almost cheaper to buy the frozen GF bread from the grocery store.\n\nThe other thing that worries me is there is a regular bakery next door, and while I assume that they do not share a ventilation system I do worry about contamination.

I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, I left disappointed. The atmosphere is charming, tucked away in Chatham Village and with a surprisingly extensive menu. However, the moment I asked about the wifi, my hopes were dashed. Turns out, there is no internet here. As a remote worker, this was a major letdown and almost a deal-breaker. It's a shame because I could have easily spent hours here, sipping on a latte and getting work done, if only they had internet access. Perhaps this is more of a spot for in-person meetings or catching up with friends. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the convenience of wifi everywhere nowadays. But regardless, not having it here was a huge downside for me. I did try their roast beef panini, which was tasty and a great deal at only $7, but the lack of wifi definitely put a damper on my experience.

The search for delicious Chinese food in Henderson has led me to Lotus, and I have to say, I was slightly disappointed. While the cashew chicken was made to my liking with a touch of spice, there was something missing from the overall flavor that I just couldn't put my finger on. My friend, who happened to be visiting from San Francisco, was also not impressed with his steak. Apparently, the cooks did not follow his specific instructions for toppings. But let's be honest, we shouldn't expect a five-star steak at a Chinese restaurant. My rating may have been a bit higher if I had come alone, but with my friend's underwhelming experience, I can only give it a mediocre rating.

We were excited to try out this highly-rated restaurant, especially since they boasted about their renowned service. However, we were greatly disappointed by our visit. The waitstaff seemed uninterested and untrained, resulting in my friend's order being wrong not once, not twice, but three times. And this wasn't just a case of being picky - the mistakes were ridiculous, like the wrong type of bread and missing a crucial ingredient. To make matters worse, my meal was served ice cold while we waited for my friend's order to be fixed. And what was even more frustrating was the lack of apology or acknowledgement from anyone, not even a manager, about the mistakes and delays.

My experience at Bravo Bistro was not the best. I had high hopes for the restaurant after hearing great things about it, but unfortunately, my experience did not live up to the hype. The website and other reviews made the wine selection and Mediterranean cuisine seem top-notch, but in reality, they were both lacking. 

As soon as I looked at the wine list, I was disappointed. It seemed outdated and many of the bottles I wanted to order were unavailable. The server had to go back and forth multiple times to check and even then, couldn't find a pinot noir to offer. Instead, my wife was presented with a bottle of Castle Rock, which we later found out was only $6 at the supermarket. Talk about a letdown. 

To make matters worse, when I went to order the veal ossobuco, I was told that it was also unavailable. At this point, I was starting to get frustrated. The server then recommended the lasagna, claiming it was a house specialty. But when it arrived, it was nothing special and reminded me of something I could get at a chain restaurant. 

Aside from the cold and well-poured beer, the service and presentation were subpar. The staff seemed inexperienced and unable to make recommendations. And when it came to my salad, I was disappointed to find it was greasy and barely had any of the promised toppings. 

In the end, this restaurant did not live up to its reputation for me. Not only did they not include fries with their burger (which should be a given), but they also failed to impress with their mediocre service and lackluster dishes.

I'm no cheese expert but I have had my fair share of cheeses and actually have tried a few at different tapas restaurants. I kid you not I'm pretty sure the cheeses on this so called \""Spanish cheese platter\"" were Brie, Swiss, Parmesan and some blue cheese. One small piece each at $16! Oh also, when the server dropped off our dishes, he didn't explain anything to us. Didn't bother to let us know the ingredients or describe the dishes to us whatsoever. My lobster gazpacho was just ok. Nothing bad but nothing special. Let's move onto my main course, crispy chicken... More like chicken fingers that had no seasoning and overly salty potato and chorizo on the bottom. Terrible. My friends pork chop was way over cooked. It was like eating jerky.

She pulled out at least five containers for me to smell, telling me the health benefits of each of the different types of tea.

While she was weighing the tea, I could read the amount she had weighed in, but never throughout the weighing process did she tell me how much per ounce or how much the 3~ ounces would cost me. I finally realized I bought more than my intended two ounces per mix when she rang it up. Not cool. Again, the canister thing was what bothered me. She mentioned it was $7 but even with my polite attempt to say that it wasn't really for me, she continued with the, \""it's airtight and it'll stay fresh longer!\"" shtick.

My first time at this caf\u00e9 was a hit! The prices were affordable, which is always a plus, and the staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. But let's talk about the desserts - they were to die for! My cousin had the Sinful 7 cake, and I couldn't help but keep sneaking bites when she wasn't looking. My friend opted for the Rocky Road brownie, which was just as indulgent and amazing. And my Berry Cr\u00e8me Brule was truly outstanding. I can't wait to come back and try more of their sweet treats. The only downside was the wait time for our food, but that didn't take away from the overall experience. Highly recommend this spot for a sugar fix!"
758,"ha ha, this was i believe the very first bar i ever went to. i was 18 or 19, and my roommate was a bartender. he got me in and, as a young punk used to drinking 40s in the desert, i was blown away.\ni think i even uttered the words to my older sister, \""why does everyone look like they're auditionin for a calvin klien ad?\"" hee, hee, how young and foolish i was. for the record she did not answer, \""so they can get laid,\"" possibly in an attempt to protect my youthful innocence, but shrugged and offered, \""i dunno, hey, you have to try a cosmopolitan!\"" \n\ni was then in for my second big shock of drinking in bars. i again, stupidly announced, \""that drink costs the same as a bottle of Gordon's!\"" (you know, the safeway brand vodka)... ha ha.\n\nso, to get to the point- pretty people, expensive drinks, imported cheese platter-type apps. and yes, i was utterly disappointed and scarred by the \""bar scene\"" for years, until i made my next underage bar visit to PV."

We had high hopes for this restaurant, but unfortunately, our experience was just average. While the atmosphere was lovely and the property was beautifully decorated, the food and service left much to be desired. We were disappointed to find that there was not a single vegetarian entree on the menu, which is unusual for most restaurants now. And to make things worse, the tortillas were cold and tough to chew, making the overall dining experience unenjoyable. I even requested a vegetarian substitute for the taco meat entree, but was disappointed to find that it didn't come with rice as promised. My fianc√©'s carne de fuego was equally underwhelming, as it didn't come with any sides or tortillas as expected. And to top it off, the service was below average, as it took 10 minutes for our plates to be cleared after we finished our meal. We were considering having our rehearsal dinner here, but after this experience, we won't be returning. It's a shame, because the restaurant itself is beautiful, but the food and service just don't measure up."

I've been to the Arizona State Fair multiple times and it's always a fun experience. Sure, the food prices are a bit steep and the crowds can be overwhelming, but it's all part of the fair experience. The grounds could use some sprucing up, and let's not even talk about the carnival workers... But overall, it's a good time. I have to say, I'm a fan of the transition from tickets to cards for rides and games. It definitely makes things easier. And don't forget to check out the lineup for upcoming performances, they always have some amazing musicians lined up. 

Be warned, parking can be a real hassle, especially on the weekends. And it'll cost you anywhere from $10 to $30. But hey, at least the entrance fee is only $10 (it used to be more). Children under five get in for free and it's only $5 for kids above the age of five. Not bad at all. But be prepared to spend a little more on tickets and food. My boyfriend and I ended up spending over $100, which included 40 tickets for various rides and our indulgent carnival food choices (salad was definitely on my mind when we left). And trust me, bring cash. The ATMs charge a ridiculous convenience fee. 

Overall, the State Fair is a blast with thrilling rides, decent games, and delicious (but not so healthy) food. If you're looking for a fun time, this is the place to be."
761,"i'm a bit disappointed with this restaurant, but perhaps my expectations were set a little too high.  First of all, don't let them trick you into thinking the last three salads are entree sizes.  I asked them about the seared ahi tuna salad size and they said it was entree size.  What I received was about 4 slices of seared tuna and maybe about 10 bites of greens.  Boy, did I need another \""entree\""  or maybe it was the wicked spoon buffet that stretched out my tummy.  I also ordered warm chicken with brie with french fries.  Their french fries were thin almost like chips rather than french fries, which I was disappointed with.  The sandwich was good but needed more chicken so that the sides can have more than  just bread and onions.  Seriously, for $13 they should be able to put a bit more chicken.  The steak frite was not bad but not great either."
762,"My bad experience here started with dirty silverware and menus.  Our server Jose was very rude and didn't know much about his menu.  We ordered a half bottle of wine and were not presented with the cork then he asked \""do you want to taste it?\""  It should be automatic to present the cork and pour a taste of the wine.  The lump crab artichoke dip was good but needed salt.  The lobster bisque was the worst I've ever had.  It came out in a mustard yellow color with maybe 2 pieces of lobster in it.  Horrible flavor.  Next the server asked me how I wanted my prime rib cooked like I get a choice.  Prime rib is always served rare to medium rare.  If you want the $30 three course you should know that you can only have the french onion soup, meatloaf, some kind of chicken or a small steak as the main course, and I don't remember the dessert.  I will never eat here again."
763,"I HAVE WALKED OUT OF THIS PLACE 3 TIMES now and won't be back. I had no choice but to walk out because the wait staff purposely ignore customers in this joint.

You walk in, get seated, and then get intentionally ignored by pathic waiters who do not want to work.\n\nDon't bother eat here you will not be served. The food is overpriced Applebees anyway. I did eat here one time and the food was UNEDIBLE!!! The meatballs were rock hard. It was absolutely disgusting. No human being could eat such garbage."

We didn't feel like customers we felt like we were an inconvenience.\n\nThe thing is that we didn't mind waiting our turn but someone could have come and said,  \""we know you have been waiting a long time and we will be with you as soon as we can.\"" but instead we were treated like crap. \n\nMy suggestion for anyone needing professional make-up in Vegas is to skip the MAC store and go to Bobbi Brown."

I was really hoping to love this place, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. My co-worker and I decided to check it out for lunch since it recently opened. When we arrived, the parking lot was packed and the inside was just as busy. We opted to sit at the bar instead of waiting for a table. The server took our orders and brought us a basket of bread, which we devoured while waiting for our food. After about 5 minutes, we were still waiting and our server offered us more bread. However, those never came and we had to ask our server for an update. She informed us that the bread was still baking and our food would be ready soon. It took a total of 15 minutes before our food finally arrived, and even then, our orders were mixed up. I had to swap my sandwich with my co-worker's and my side was incorrect as well. While the pulled pork was decent, some parts were a bit dry and I had to add extra BBQ sauce to make it more palatable. The mac and cheese was too creamy for my liking. The service was subpar as well, with our server only stopping by once to offer more water but never actually refilling it. Overall, it was a mediocre experience and not something I would rush back to. "
766,"I want to love this place so much.  I want to roll around nekkid with it.  But sadly I had a very disappointing experience there.  We lucked out and got a seat at the bar in the basement.  The basement is one of the coolest places to take a date in town. The atmosphere and wine did not disappoint.  I ordered their caesar salad with shrimp. When asked if I wanted it grilled or blackened, I chose grilled. Sadly when my salad arrived, the shrimp had been blackened and all moisture evaporated from them.  They were like chewy Stretch Armstrongs.  When I pointed this out to the bartender, she simply said, \""that's how it comes.'  I get that not everyone's tastes are the same.  But I cannot think of anyone who would have enjoyed gnawing on these poor little creatures who sat sadly in a bed of lettuce cores and stems.  The brie toast was amazing, so they are capable.\n\nI will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere.  They SO need to fix the quality of their food or at least their service when something like this happens."
767,"This will be my last contract with Verizon. I just bought the droid razr. I did not get any kind of a deal for signing to a new contract after being eligible for an upgrade.

Welcome to Shadyside!\n\nWe got charged $13 for antibiotics (which we could have gotten for much less or free at Giant Eagle's Pharmacy. The option was never given to me). Dr. Cangin recommended this really expensive flea + tick + heartworm medicine, and the woman at the front desk gave me her own advice and said to just use K9 Advantix and Heartgard since the medicine the vet recommended was expensive and made the other receptionist's dog sick. Say what now? Talk about conflicting. I was charged $25 for 'Cytology - Otic' which was swabbing his ears and checking the samples with a microscope for infection, $40 for ear ointment to treat a yeast infection in the dog's ear (not sure this could have been cheaper elsewhere), and $49 for 'Exam - Problem Oriented'. Whatever that means other than $CHA-CHING$\n\nThe round of antibiotics we got was only for 14 days and didn't knock out his skin infection. It came back with a vengeance not long after the antibiotics were through. When we took him to the clinic at the ARL 3 weeks later they couldn't believe EEVMC didn't give us steroids to reduce the inflammation from his scratching in addition to a longer round of antibiotics. Which explains why he never stopped scratching and the infection never had time to go away, or his skin time to heal.\n\nWe were pretty unimpressed. To top it off, when we called for a second appointment after his skin inflammation got WAY worse they couldn't get us an appointment for 4 days. I get that they're busy but are you really going to allow my dog to scratch himself raw for a superfluous amount of time because you're booked?? You can't possibly squeeze me in somewhere? I would have taken any appointment at any time with no notice. The ARL was much more accommodating, and we only paid $15 for our appointment there since it was our first appointment after adopting him. They still would have been cheaper either way, though.\n\nPretty meh about this vet, as convenient as its location may be."

I had the worst nail experience at this salon. I went in for a manicure and pedicure but ended up with a disaster. At first, the nail technician, Jenni, seemed great, but things quickly went downhill. She constantly left me waiting in the middle of my manicure to attend to her ""regular"" clients, leaving me feeling neglected and frustrated. To make matters worse, she started painting my nails while I was getting a pedicure, resulting in a sloppy and rushed job. The chips and dents on my nails were proof of her unprofessionalism and lack of attention to detail. I was so disappointed that I'm already considering painting over them. I would never recommend this place unless you are a ""regular"" and get special treatment. Save yourself the time and money, go somewhere else. "

After much contemplation, I finally decided to give Ballys a try for my Las Vegas vacation. And boy, was I disappointed. While the location and price may have been appealing, the actual experience was far from satisfactory. The disorganization and confusion from the service staff left us waiting for over 25 minutes before we were even helped. And once our order was placed, it took a whopping 40 minutes to receive our sushi order, which was only fair in terms of taste. To make matters worse, we never even received our short ribs or edamame. The only saving grace was the salad, which was surprisingly very good. But unfortunately, that's not enough to overlook the terrible service and excessive wait time. I don't see myself ever returning to Ballys, no matter how tempting the location and price may be."

772,"I usually go to Regal Stonecrest Cinemas 22 because (a) I'm in the area shopping or dining already, (b) they offer movie options (including 3-D screenings) that other places don't, or (c) because they have so many theaters, they're showing the movie I want to see at the time I want to see it.   Other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this particular theater.  It's usually very crowded with teens who just like to \""hang out\"" in the lobby or outside, the ticket lines move slowly, the automatic ticketing machine is usually broken and/or isn't set up to accept my Regal movies rewards card, their rewards program isn't that great, and the lobby (especially the snack counter) and theaters aren't as clean as they should be.  Regal could learn A LOT from AMC Theatres in many respects."

I don't think the boba is exceptional to make up for the poor service either. I guess if you with good company and you're craving boba late at night, this is just where everyone goes.."

We stumbled upon this brewery while exploring Washington and were initially drawn in by the unique atmosphere. The place had a cozy, woodsy vibe that made us feel like we were in a cabin in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. However, our excitement quickly faded after tasting their selection of beers. The Suit-and-Tie IPA tasted like we were gnawing on pine cones in an attempt to survive in the wild. The Weisse beer was sour in a strange and unpalatable way, almost as if it had an illicit relationship with the red sour keg. While I personally enjoy a good sour beer, the rest of my group did not, so I took one for the team and finished everyone's glasses. The stout was underwhelming and the IPA, while not as offensive as the others, still had a dominant pine flavor. Overall, the beer was a huge disappointment and I can't believe it was hailed as the best brewery in the country. However, I do have to give them props for their unique and inviting atmosphere. Maybe we just caught them on a bad day with their brews. I can't speak for the food since we didn't try it, but based on our experience with the beers, I wouldn't recommend this place. However, if you have a love for pine needles and squirrel vomit, this might just be your new favorite spot."
775,"It was my first time here and will probably be the last. My bf decided to take me here for July 4th dinner before we hit the fireworks. Our waitress, Ashley, took our order and never came back. We got our food from another girl and she took care of us. Our burgers were plain and it was like they were stingy with the bbq sauce when it was supposed to have bbq sauce on it. Can't even taste it. Our drinks was emptied for a long time, and no one seemed to care. There was a man in a green shirt, maybe he's the manager or whatever he was, but he was walking around talking on his phone. That's just rude. If you're gonna talk on the phone, go somewhere else, don't come walking around everyone talking. He walked by us a couple of times and act as if he didn't see our empty cups. The first waitress came back and had the nerve to ask \""Can I wrap this up for you?\"" \n\nReally? Does it look like I'm done?!! \n\nShe don't even come check on us or refill our drinks and, when she does come check on us, she asked us to leave? How RUDE?!\n\nSo at the end of our meal, we get a survey to take, and I wrote my honest opinion on it and I'm sure she threw that paper away because I did NOT right good about her.\n\nSo, thanks a lot, Cowfish, for making this year the worst July 4th dinner."

I've been a loyal member of this gym for over 5 years now, but I have to say, the past few months have been a disappointment. The cleanliness and maintenance of the facilities have drastically declined. I've noticed a strong, unpleasant smell on the towels, the clocks have stopped working, and don't even get me started on the drinking fountains - they have things stuck to them that make me cringe. And let's not forget about the broken machines that stay unrepaired for weeks. It's unacceptable and frankly, it's making me reconsider my membership.

But that's not even the worst part. What's the deal with the toilet seat covers? One week they're there, the next they're gone. It's beyond frustrating and makes me question the hygiene practices of this gym. I don't want to risk getting sick just from using the restroom.

I used to love this gym, but now I find myself actively looking for a new one. It's a shame because it was once a good place to work out. I really hope they can turn things around and bring back the cleanliness and functionality that this gym used to have. Until then, I'll be taking my business elsewhere."

I decided to try out Outback Steakhouse while visiting Vegas, and unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. I've always been a fan of Outback, but this location just couldn't deliver. I ordered their signature steak and lobster, expecting a delicious and satisfying meal. However, the lobster was so overcooked that it was tough and tasteless. And don't even get me started on the steak. It was like a cheap piece of meat from Walmart, tough and flavorless. I could barely get it down. To top it off, our waitress broke my debit card while processing our bill and didn't even have the decency to mention it. I only found out when she returned my card and walked away. Talk about lack of responsibility and customer service. Save yourself the money and disappointment and stay at the Bellagio instead. Trust me, the amazing hotel atmosphere, world-class restaurants and bars, and top-notch amenities will far outweigh anything Outback could offer. "

780,"Pho


Intrigued by their unique menu options, my friends and I decided to give C-Pho a try. Located right in the heart of the city, it was the perfect spot for a quick lunch break. The pho was good, but not exceptional. We've had other pho dishes with a more flavorful broth, but what set C-Pho apart were their other offerings.

From their extensive list of boba drinks to their unconventional appetizers like octopus balls and escargot, C-Pho definitely caters to those with a sense of adventure. And let me tell you, their spring rolls were out of this world! They had a variety of options beyond the standard pork/shrimp combo, making it a refreshing change.

However, I must admit that the prices were a bit steep for what we received. While the food was good, it wasn't spectacular enough to justify the cost. Additionally, the service was a little lacking. We had a few mishaps with our order and some dishes were not executed as well as we had hoped.

Overall, I would recommend C-Pho if you're in the mood to try something new and exciting. But if you're solely in the mood for pho, there are other places that do it better. Next time, I'll be sure to stick with their boba drinks and spring rolls, which were definitely the highlights of our meal. "
781,"Lazy,  lazy!!  IT HAS SLIPPED big-time, this week, at least. Usually one of my favorite LV restaurants, Olives let me down--and on a special occasion, too. \n\nSpecifics: The Caesar salad included relentless little chunks of hard, unripe tomato (???), stale croutons, and no anchovy at all, that I could taste. Well, maybe they waved one over the romaine, but the dressing was SO bland, and of course there was no salt or pepper on the table, this being such a special place.

I would like to think it was just a bad night, but alas my experience is likely indicitive of a bigger issue.\n\nThe bottom line: since last visit prices increased and portion size decreased. (I wish I had realized this last night as the owner happen to be seated at a table behind us with his friends and we had a long conversation about how much we loved the place.)\n\nTook a friend for her 40th birthday as a treat. At first glance in looking at the menu the prices seamed higher than I recalled, but not until comparing reciepts at home today (and the menu here in yelp) was it confirmed. I also left last time feeling full and satisified. This time ordered more and more, but alas left not so full.\n\nExamples of some of the changes:\n- Calamari\n    Previous Price: $10 (also price they show on menu online) \n    Last night: $14\n\n- Short Rib Stoganoff\n    Previous Price: $19 (also price they show on menu online) \n    Last night: $34 \n   Also, look at the pics of fellow yelpers, it used to be 3 portions of rib with  pieces of pasta. Last night it was only 1 with garnish. (not exactly a big plate portion as indicated)\n\nFor roughly the same meal, last time our check was just under $200 for 2 people including a bottle of wine. Last night, with the addition of a flatbread, but otherwise the same meal just over $400.  ouch!\n\nThere are more examples, but you get the idea. I'm sure RRL would say they are just a business adjusting prices based on food costs, and the one time out-of-towners on expense accounts won't bat an eye.\n\nAs a local this went from being my go-to-special plate, to a place that's not quite worth it. (sadly)  \n\n\nSince RRL has entertainment, they charge the LET tax plus sales tax (18%), so that on top of inflated prices and smaller portions...  too much for this gal.\n\nI'm including my prvious review below as context .\n\nReview from 8/22 visit 5 Star\nWell done RRL. While the ticketed show is closed, the restaurant has incorporated 30 minute acts that change & evolve throughout the night.

The last time I went I vowed never to go again and I haven't. We were a group of four trying to catch a quick bite before going to see a movie at Cinema du Parc. There was only one table free when we entered. The table was for six people. The waitress refused to let us sit in that table because she said that it was reserved exclusively for parties of six. It didn't matter if no one was there, we couldn't sit there because we were only four. We argued a bit but it wasn't working so we ended up waiting and finally got a table after a ten minute wait.

We didn't realize they even served food, we just thought it was a brewery, and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour. Our tour guide Jimmy was drunk. He was staggering around, waving his arms, stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg), taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour, except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting, but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers, you have to pay, which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale, but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process, though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany, and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product."

The rolls small and outrageous prices even for Vegas and all of em fell apart as we tried to eat them.  I know MGM is hurting financially and have drastically even cut back comps to  a bare minimum, but come on $16-17 for a  sashmi salad? Their signature roll is horrible.

This hidden gem is definitely worth checking out! The traditional Hawaiian-Polynesian dishes are the standout at Moki's Hawaiian Grill. I highly recommend trying the No. 7 everyday special - 2 eggs, a burger patty with brown gravy, side salad and your choice of white or brown rice. Each bite was bursting with flavor and the soy sauce on each table is the perfect accompaniment. The imported Hawaiian drinks are also a must-try and will leave you feeling refreshed. Don't forget to save room for dessert, their island-style options are a treat. As for the service, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, making every dining experience enjoyable. Plus, on the third Friday of each month, you can catch a live performance from Polynesian dancers while enjoying an all-you-can-eat buffet for just $10.00! Be sure to mark your calendar. While the food may not be exceptional, the atmosphere and entertainment make up for it. So whether you're craving a delicious chicken katsu with their special sauce or simply want to sip on their signature Hawaiian drinks, Moki's Hawaiian Grill is the perfect spot to satisfy your cravings.

I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant after hearing rave reviews about their Singapore street noodles. As soon as we walked by, the amazing smell of the food caught our attention and we knew we had to give it a try. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and we were quickly seated by our friendly waitress.

We decided to order the vegetarian spring rolls as an appetizer, but unfortunately, they were a major disappointment. These ""vegetarian"" spring rolls were actually egg rolls saturated in oil. All we could taste was the oil, and it was definitely not appealing. However, the Singapore street noodles were a different story. The flavors were spot on and the noodles had the perfect texture. We loved them so much that we decided to order them for take-out the next time we visit.

Although the food was delicious, the customer service was just mediocre. Despite us being the only customers during lunch on a Saturday, it took quite some time for our waitress to take our drink and food order. It felt like she was more focused on the TV in the back than on her job. We appreciated her friendliness, but it was a bit off-putting.

Overall, I would recommend this place for their amazing Singapore street noodles. Just be cautious of the vegetarian options and don't expect top-notch service."
790,"This restaurant was bad on every level. The waitress was disimterested amd thoroughly unfamilair with the menu. The guacamole tasted fresh out pf a can, though I was told it is made fresh daily. It tasted identical, and just as bad as,  he guacamole in a jar at a grocery store. The fajita seasoning was extremely salty. Both my fajitas and my friends arroz con pollo suffered from raw vegetables. I know this place is new but there isn't exactly a paucity of mexican restaurants in the area. I wont be going back."
791,"This was an awful experience start to finish. We entered and noticed right away that the place looked rundown - cheap art, bad carpentry, and water damage to the drop ceiling with missing tiles.  We were told to sit anywhere and after a long wait (20+) our waitress stopped to take our order. Requested a beer - the tap was not working which in hindsight was probably a blessing as the best part of the entire meal was the bottle of Carlsberg. \n\nWe ordered  guacamole - and were told they were out of it. After changing our choices, the waitress returned to tell us they are out of the sauce for the spicy shrimp? Not a great start but it gets worse. \n\nThe apps come out and were ok. We then waited over an hour for the entrees while watching surrounding tables be seated AND get their food.  My companion had ordered the mushrooms which came out and were so salty as to be inedible. We told the waitress who merely gave a perfunctory \""sorry\"" and removed the plate. After another 15 minute wait, the remainder of the meal arrived. The lamb was of course well overcooked and the shrimp dish again overly salted. \n\nThe waitress was apologetic and blamed the kitchen. The wait was horrible, the ambiance nonexistant, the prices too high and the quality of the food about what you could expect from your local 7-11. All in all one of the worst dining experiences in Montreal."

I used to be a frequent customer at this establishment, visiting it often with my family since it opened just a few minutes away from our home. However, our recent visit was a major disappointment. Being married to a Japanese woman, the quality of sushi is very important to us and she was not impressed with the sushi here. In fact, even my teenage son noticed that the fish was not up to par and had a bloody texture. As much as I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, we can no longer justify going back to this restaurant. We hope to find better sushi options in the area. "
793,"Ahhhh...heavenly Marriott bed, how I love thee.  The best thing about a full-service Marriott is their beds.  Hands down.  After working 12 hour days I know I can climb under the fluffy down comforter and fall asleep within minutes.  Those beds are the bomb people.  The beds at this Marriott didn't disappoint...but the rest of the hotel fell a little short.  It's an older property and a little overdue for a makeover.  Simply put, it's just not the nicest Marriott I have ever stayed in.  Maybe it's the location (downtown Mesa is not the most exciting place) but the hotel was pretty vacant when I was staying there.  My guess is that the hotel management's theory is that if there are no guests there to accommodate, why bother putting forth the effort.  The staff was nice, not the best but definitely not the worst.  The housekeeping didn't skimp on the cleaning...but they definitely skip on the towels.  Maybe they were ticked off that I used the majority of my towels each day (hey, I'm 2 shower a day gal with the wicked hot temps in Phoenix!) but there were 3, yes 3, days that I was left towel-less.  Zero.  Not even a wash cloth.  I learned my lesson after the first time and always checked to make sure I have towels BEFORE getting into the shower, but come on people.  Towels are just SUPPOSED to be there; right along with the free Bath and Body Works shampoo and lotion that has a weird scent they don't even sell in the stores.  Each time I called the front desk they would have towels to my room within minutes, but the point is that I shouldn't even have to worry about not being stocked with towels.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had to \""air-dry\"" one night after my shower, I would probably have given this property 3 stars.  As a previous reviewer stated they do give you milk and cookies each night if you are on the executive floors so that was a nice touch.  But the towel thing irritated me, so it will stay a 2."
794,"This small restaurant caught the eye of my wife and I for breakfast.  The decor, ambience, and service were great.  The food wasn't.  We both ordered the breakfast combos (one with frencht toast, one with pancakes) with eggs, bacon, and toast.  The breakfast was comparable to a Jimmy Dean or Swanson frozen breakfast.  Sadly, this breakfast totaled around $30. Ouch."

During the Arabian night at this restaurant, I was treated like family and welcomed with open arms. The live traditional music and belly dancers set the perfect atmosphere for the evening. Although it was a family-style dinner, I was thoroughly satisfied with the variety of dishes served. From the salad and pita bread, to the hummus and babaghanouj, everything was delicious. But the highlight for me was definitely the Beef and Chicken Shawarma. The host made sure my plate was always full and I couldn't resist going back for seconds (and maybe thirds). 

The entertainment continued with the mesmerizing belly dancers who had everyone in the restaurant entranced. Their talent and energy had even the shyest of guests on their feet, dancing and showering the dancers with money. It truly added to the magical atmosphere of the night. And speaking of dancing, I couldn't resist participating in a traditional group dance and showing off my best Shakira-inspired moves. And let me tell you, I fit right in!

To top it all off, we were treated to some Hookah on the patio, courtesy of Hookah Mania. It was the perfect way to end the evening and reflect on the amazing experience we just had. Overall, this restaurant may not have received a perfect 5-star review from me, but it definitely exceeded my expectations and left me with a memorable experience. I can't wait to come back and try their regular menu and hopefully give another star. "

Perhaps I should have waited a few days before making my initial review. Yep, I should have. 

At this point, I was thinking there's something wrong with me, but after wearing Skechers for years, I know it's not just me. 

I was so excited to see that they had width sizing for my feet, which are a little wider than average. But when I put these shoes on, they were tighter than I expected, even with the so-called ""width sizing."" I was left wondering if they even understand what that means. And let's not even talk about the style. I thought I was getting a sturdy, all-black shoe for work, but instead I got something that looks like it belongs in a clown's collection. 

As if that wasn't bad enough, these shoes are just not durable. Sure, they might hold up for a few months, but after a year they are falling apart and looking like they've been through a war. My 14-year-old brown mud stompers have lasted longer than these ""quality"" Skechers. 

I can honestly say that these are not the most comfortable shoes ever. They may claim to have gel insoles and whatnot, but that does not make up for the fact that they are poorly made and uncomfortable to wear. I would not choose these over a pair of Air Jordans, even if they were free. It's just not worth it. 

I came into Skechers with high hopes, but I was clearly wrong. Don't be fooled by the popular brand name and hype - these shoes are not worth the money. Save your feet and your wallet and steer clear."
797,"My husband and I took our truck \""mudding\"" - (out driving around in the mud) and his truck was covered. I decided to surprise him and have his truck detailed since he has been working so hard lately. Because of the reviews I was really excited to see the finished product. \n\nWhen I first pulled up the system was a little confusing, some sort of signage for newbies like me could have been helpful. I walked inside and was greeted by someone that I had to ask \""Do you work here\"" because frankly, I couldn't tell! Either way he was very nice and told me to pull the truck around the corner where he would meet me to discuss a price. \n\nI got back into my truck and met with the man (I never got his name!) where we had decided on $100 for a full exterior detail. For $100 I expect the outside to be shining. EVERYWHERE. My truck was washed and then pulled into the detail area. I waited for a little over 2.5 hours for them to be finished. It was dark outside so I could not fully see everything. I drove straight home and waited for my husband to see his surprise! In the dark it looked shiny, from afar. \n\nOverall the truck looks good. There was a lot of spots that were missed and there is still a lot of dirt on the underside, the rims of the truck and I was surprised at how much dirt there was in the crevices by the windows. I'm pretty sure a light spray could have fixed that. There were some spots when I went out this morning to look but mostly I was just disappointed by the dirt that was still there.\n\nI may go back again. I don't know. I probably wont get the exterior detail due to the price and the fact that someone who got the express detail $40 looked just as good as the $100 that I paid."
798,This place isn't great...Food was okay...Service was ehhhh & I probably go back if coworkers wanted to but I'd probably talk them to going somewhere else...So a party of 6 was like $300--Tip is included for a party that is...Be WARNED!!!! Happy hour has great prices but you can only do soooo much with happy hour...You know!!!
799,"Wow, I'm going to be the black sheep here and give this restaurant only two stars.  When my husband and I entered for lunch a few days ago, the manager or owner was talking on the phone.  We stood by politely waiting, until he pointed us to sit *with his CHIN* - the phone still strapped to his ear, never once addressing or welcoming us to sit by words!   I was surprised, but didn't say anything.  \n\nThe restaurant itself was really dark inside, there were no lights turned on at all, just a little natural light coming from the small heavily curtained windows.  Nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in my line of thinking, so this restaurant just failed in these respects.   \n\nThe buffet itself was fine, nothing was amazing nor was anything bad.  After we sat with our food, the same manager brought a basket of naan and actually TOSSED it down onto our table as he walked by without even making eye contact with us, still jabbering away on his phone.   My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed, it was that bizarre!\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back.  There are other Indian buffets in town that serve great food, have an inviting ambiance and treat me like a valued customer."

We were excited to try out this hotel after hearing about its recent renovations. The size of the hotel is impressive, with over 3,000 rooms, making it a great option for large groups. However, we were slightly disappointed with some aspects of our stay. While check-in was quick, navigating through the casino to get to the guest elevators was a bit of a hassle. The variety of restaurants offered at the hotel was a plus, but unfortunately, our dining experience fell short. The continental breakfast was underwhelming, with a croissant that was too doughy and a mediocre crepe omelet. We decided to give their mushroom spinach quiche a try, and while the flavors were good, the dough was still raw, detracting from our enjoyment. The saving grace was the gorgeous pool, but it tended to get overcrowded with people enjoying drinks on the edge. We did, however, thoroughly enjoy the volcano show at the neighboring hotel. All in all, our stay at the Mirage was decent, but we were hoping for more. With a few improvements, this hotel has the potential to be an exceptional stay in Sin City."
801,"Got a great priceline price of $55 with a free breakfast (hot entree with oj and coffee)  and free shuttle from the airport til 10pm and a free happy hour with light snacks.\nNow the downside:\nThe place is old and run down, outside looks great with the 2 pools, and tennis courts but when you get in the rooms, they are old, musty and dated.  \nThere is a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and toaster oven inside the room.\nWhen I checked in late night, the staff wasn't very helpful, felt like I was bothering them.\nSince the place is so large and the doors open to the outside, doesn't feel as secure for a single female traveler."
802,"We hired them to move from the bay area to Las Vegas. After much research we decided to go with this local company because their price was the most reasonable, and they could do packing, moving, and unpacking. We called and gave them requested information such as square footage of the house and list of furniture we had. When we tried to tell them more details, such as number of rooms in the house, they didn't want the information. They said it would be no problem and gave us an estimate of 5 hours for moving and packing, which we were shocked, but they assured us that they have very experienced movers. When the guys arrived, however, they acted very surprised by how much they were supposed to pack and move. They later told me it's because houses are built differently in San Francisco vs. Las Vegas, they didn't expect so many rooms given the square footage. But we did gave them a list of furniture and number of boxes before their arrival! Anyway, they were able to hire two extra men on site and managed to finish the job. I have to say I was very worried watching them pack. They wrapped nothing, even glassware, and just throw it into the box loosely. Luckily the hired men from another company (McCarthy Moving and Storage) handled our baby grand piano and they did a superb job. When we arrived in Las Vegas, there were only a few damages: the front wheel and basket was broken of a bike, and a beautiful arm chair was stained on the side. It was a great relief. The movers were hard working and courteous and tried to do the best job given the situation.\n\nI think overall if you pack everything yourself or move within Las Vegas, or have nothing super valuable like a grand piano, this company is fine. But with our experience I would most likely look for another company the next time we move."
803,"I went to the Farmers Market to walk around in the glorious warm sun and left with pretty much just carbs...I bought bread, pasta and unfortunately, bagels from Gotham.  The bagels themselves weren't bad...nothing to write home about in my opinion..but not awful.  It was the service that is really why I would never go back.  I waited in line with a friend-she ordered her bagels and then I went to order next and was VERY loudly accused of cutting in line by a rude man who seemed to think he was in charge.  I calmly explained that I was waiting here the entire time and then started to order the bagels but he was extremely short and rude with me the entire time.  No time for that-I'll get my bagels from Bagels Forever instead!"
804,"

I had high hopes for this restaurant after seeing all the positive reviews and recommendations from locals. Unfortunately, my experience was far from impressive. First of all, our drinks took forever to arrive and when they did, my old fashioned was made incorrectly. I decided to brush it off and focus on the food, but our waiter's behavior made it impossible. His racist remarks were not only inappropriate, but also completely unacceptable. The fact that he tried to redeem himself by rushing through a confusing and incomprehensible explanation of the menu items only made the situation worse. \n\nDespite our waiter's behavior, we tried to enjoy our meals. However, my mini mushroom pan fry was greasy and lacked flavor, while the salad was just ""fine"". My husband's swordfish was saved by the tasty butter sauce, and our friends' bison meatloaf and filet mignon were decent. We found some redemption in the dessert menu, which was delicious and managed to slightly improve our overall experience. However, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Scottsdale area. The poorly trained staff and mediocre food just doesn't make it worth the time or money. With so many other amazing restaurants in the area, why waste your time here?"
805,"This place was disappointing on many levels. Tried the only two beers they had, the first (Mario beer) tasted worst than miller lite. And the other was $21 for a pint of mediocre beer. The pizza sauce tasted like raw tomatoes. A good pizzeria should make sure the sauce is cooked properly. The desert was another thing. I ordered two types of gelato and they told me they wanted to charge me more if they serve them separately!? WTF? Oh and you can't change or alter any menu item because the great Mario wants it served a certain way. \n\nI won't be back here ever again."
806,"Miserable, through no fault of the staff. There was just something about this particular Target - the worst, angriest, weirdest customers in the world just seem to flock here.

807,"I came here with my family during lunch time this Friday afternoon. We were craving Korean food before we go grocery shopping at Greenland. I suggested that we should go to a Korean ayce bbq on Spring Mtn. (like Honey Pig, or Tofu Hut) but since we were on the cross-street S. Decatur we decided to go to the plaza this restaurant is located in anyways.\n\nThe food was okay, nothing special or \""delicious\"" as the restaurant name says. It was just eatable. We ordered their ojingeo bokkeum (some squid dish), hot bibimbap, and tofu soup. Their bibimbap was so plain :( I definitely had better bibimbap at other Korean restaurants I've been to. Their bibimbap really lacked flavor. The only thing I liked was their handful of banchan, especially the kimchi and pickled daikon. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean, a lot of tables and seats. I think it is one of the biggest restaurants in the whole plaza and we were the only ones eating there. It's the only restaurant in this plaza without a wait and now I can see why. Now, if we went to Monta Ramen or Curry Zen around this time it would be packed! I seriously still wonder how this place even affords rent in Chinatown. The owner who served us spoke really good English and was nice though. +1\n\nOur total came out to be about $60 for three of us, which is pretty steep considering the food wasn't that good. Generous portions but I'd rather have quality over quantity. Even ayce bbq tastes better and can have more variety! We definitely could of had better food at a cheaper price somewhere else nearby. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again."

I recently visited this restaurant after seeing all the glowing reviews on Yelp. As a Korean person, I was excited to try some of my favorite dishes from home. But unfortunately, my experience here was quite disappointing.

My friends and I ordered the kimchi soup, pork meat, and the cheese beef bowl. While the dishes were presented nicely, the portion sizes were incredibly small, especially for the price. And unfortunately, the taste was just mediocre. It lacked the authentic flavors that I was hoping for and left me feeling unsatisfied.

To make matters worse, the service was extremely slow. While other tables around us were already finishing their meals, we were still waiting for our last dish to arrive. This resulted in us feeling rushed as our friends had to wait for us to finish. It was not a pleasant dining experience.

I will say that the staff were friendly, but it seemed like some of them were not very motivated to be there. That being said, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place to others. While the atmosphere was nice, the food and service just did not live up to the hype. "
809,"

Last night, my family and I decided to try out this restaurant for a quick and easy meal. Unfortunately, it turned out to be anything but quick or easy. Not only did one of our sides come out wrong, but they couldn't even get the basics right - rice and mac&cheese turned into rice and beans. How does that even happen? I'm tempted to start keeping track of all the mistakes I've encountered here on Yelp. It's becoming a trend at this point. This marks the sixth time I've been here, and every single time something has gone wrong. Missing items, incorrect orders, you name it. It's gotten to the point where it's just comical. I wish there was another location closer to me, but unfortunately, this is the only one. I guess the saying is true - you get what you pay for. And in this case, we paid for a meal with mistakes and disappointment. Thank goodness there are other options out there. Maybe next time we'll just stick to Lindo Michoacan."

After moving to California, I was excited to try out this Rubios location since I've always enjoyed their food in the past. However, I was disappointed to find that the quality and consistency didn't match up to my expectations. The few times I've visited, the food hasn't been as satisfying as the Rubios back in Surprise.

But I can still appreciate the menu and the fact that they offer healthy options. That's why I keep giving this place a chance. I just wish the food looked as good as it does in Surprise before it comes out of the kitchen.

On another note, I recently visited this shop to get my car aligned. The employees were kind and accommodating, and I was pleased with my experience. However, when I moved to California, I realized that my car was still having issues. Luckily, I was in Vegas a month later and decided to swing by this shop again.

Vince, one of the employees, was incredibly helpful and explained that my alignment was slightly off but that my power steering was the real issue. Unfortunately, they didn't have the tool to fix it, but Vince went above and beyond by calling around to find a solution for me. His co-worker even offered to take my car to another nearby shop to fix the power steering. I was blown away by their level of customer service and dedication to solving my car troubles.

The next day, I brought my car in and they not only fixed the power steering issue but also rotated my tires to alleviate the alignment problem. I couldn't be more grateful for their help and highly recommend this shop to anyone in need of car services. Overall, I was impressed by their professionalism and genuine care for their customers."
811,your staff is ignorant and rude. the girls on the telephone are nasty and laughed at me when i called twice about my problem. i waited 30 mins over the expected delivery time to get an order that had no sauce which i paid for and half my order not there. i called not 2 mins after he left and they said it would be another hour just for the sauce alone. you guys suck. horrible service. im contacting district.
812,"The food was really good! Ordered the Chicago style pie and did not disappoint. Also ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was just \""okay\"". Was more like a giant chicken finger on bread - however, the bread was really good, too!  Our biggest disappointment was with the young lady working the front. This was our first time trying rosatis's and the service seemed icy cold from the minute we walked in. It seemed clearer to us that we could have been being judged by the employee as everyone else who came in got warm greetings, follow up and friendly conversation.   I'm pretty certain the money from gay people is just as good as everyone else's.  This is simply an observation and how we were made to feel during our dining in experience."
813,"The Luxor is OK - nothing much to get excited about.  If you just want a place to sleep - this is probably a good place.  The price attracted me to the property.  The room, however, while very clean, was very dated and much in need of a facelift.  Not impressived by furniture with holes in the fabric and other worn out furniture - regardless of the price.  The elevators and public areas were also noticeably in need of repair and update.  I saw some work being done in the lobby - perhaps the rooms should become a priority.\n\nI don't understand why the Luxor really has very little in the way of restaraunts and bars.  You have to go to one of the adjoining hotels for those amenities.\n\nThe timeshare people are very disruptive and annoying - but given the number of complaints, the management really must not care about that.\n\nOverall, if the price is right, I probably would stay at the Luxor again, but it would have to be a great deal."
814,Went there to wait for friends on the roller coaster. When asked If we were eating I said I wasnt sure and was seated in their restaurant area. Ordered a drink and was given bread.

My parents were in town and we needed a place for lunch that would please everyone. After some searching, we landed on this hidden gem. The prices were really reasonable, and the portions were huge! My dad ordered the gyro and couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was. My mom and I both opted for the large salads, with her choosing chicken and me choosing gyro meat. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of food on our plates. And the best part? We had enough leftovers to cover dinner later that night. Talk about a win-win!

The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, and the service was friendly and efficient. However, I did notice that our salads were missing one important element - the dressing! It was a bit disappointing, but luckily we were able to find some at home. Aside from that, the experience was great and my parents were very happy with their meals.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for a family lunch or dinner. The food is tasty and the portions are generous, making it a great value for the money. Just make sure to double check your order before leaving!"
816,"For people who are on a budget, this actually is a great, comfortable hotel. However, every night, when I would come back to the room after my conference was over, the room smelled of mold. I'd call house keeping and they'd come spray febreez and put an air freshner. Then, I'd have to crank on the AC because the smell of the freshners were strong. All in all, it wasn't a pleasant experience and I hope next time I am in Las Vegas, I can stay at one of the nicer hotels."

I've been a loyal customer at this spot for many years now, but I have to say, I'm starting to feel a bit disappointed with the overall experience. Don't get me wrong, the bento boxes are still just as delicious and affordable as ever, but the seating situation has become a real issue lately. On the bar side, there are only a few tables available for larger groups, and it seems like the owners don't really monitor how many people are occupying those tables. My friends and I often struggle to find a place to sit, even on slower nights. And don't even get me started on the patio - despite its great atmosphere and amenities, it's almost never open. So, more often than not, my group ends up relegated to the quiet and boring dining room. I've even tried suggesting to the staff that maybe they should have more tables for smaller groups to accommodate more customers, but it seems like the ownership isn't interested in making any changes. It's a shame because I've always loved this place, but it seems like the owners are more focused on their own preferences rather than keeping their customers happy."

We were excited to stay at the Paris hotel, being lovers of the city itself. The ambiance and decor did not disappoint, but unfortunately, our experience was lacking in other areas. For starters, our cell service was practically non-existent in our room. We were told we could purchase wifi for $15 per day, but it only allowed for one device and the connection was spotty at best. To make matters worse, the cable offerings were subpar, lacking in basic channels that most hotels provide. As if that wasn't enough, we were supposed to have access to the Diamond Club, but it took days for them to process our information. It was absurd and completely inconvenient. And don't even get me started on the exorbitant charges for room service.

As business travelers, we expected basic conveniences, but were sadly disappointed. It almost felt like the hotel was purposely limiting our options in order to entice us to spend more time in the casino. As much as we wanted to relax after a long day of work with some regular TV, it was not an option. For the price we paid to stay on the Vegas strip, we expected at least the same amenities as a Motel 6 and more. Unfortunately, we were let down."
819,"Just do yourself the favor and book with a different airline. Wait time is an average of an hour- always less than 5 people working the ticket counter when the line is 150 people deep. My work books me on this airline so I fly it about two or three times a month- do yourself a favor and just pay the extra couple bucks for ANY OTHER AIRLINE. If you are even close to your departure time- just know that you will not make your flight due to the terrible way US Airlines is run. The seats are the smallest out of all the airlines, and quite honestly the whole experience is disgusting- seats are never cleaned in between flights which means you are sitting in someone else's crumby leftovers.

I have to admit, I was expecting so much more from a place that has bagels in its name. After hearing rave reviews from friends, I decided to give it a try. But let me tell you, I was far from impressed. The bagels were nothing special, just your average store-bought ones. And I know a good bagel when I taste one, being a connoisseur of Jewish deli bagels. But these just didn't cut it for me. 

I couldn't understand why people were raving about this place until I tried their soup and bagel special. Thanks to the Tuesday soup of the day, Tomato Basil, I finally had something that was decent. But even then, it still didn't make up for the lackluster bagels.

And don't even get me started on the other items on the menu. The salads and sandwiches were just mediocre, and I couldn't bring myself to try them on a bagel. I mean, why would I when that's supposedly their ""thing""?

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you're really craving a bagel and nothing else. And even then, I'd suggest just going to your local grocery store for a better tasting one. "
821,"New York vs. Montreal bagels. The everlasting debate.\n\nQuite simply, I think you will forever be loyal to whatever bagel you have been raised to eating. As a native New Yorker, I was excited to go to Montreal to try these out, and Fairmount Bagel was apparently the place to go. During weekend mornings, expect to wait on a line that goes out the door, but that doesn't say much considering the standing area in the place is as small as a closet. That's not an exaggeration.\n\nI went with the classic sliced lox and plain cream cheese on a plain bagel. It was tasty! For those who are unfamiliar, Montreal(-ian?) bagels are a little smaller, and made with honey, to give them a distinctive sweet flavor, and have a noticeably chewy texture to them. Very different from their New York counterpart.\n\n-2 for the no seating, not even any standing space. And because I while I didn't totally love it, it was still pretty good. \n\nIf in new in Montreal and have any appreciation for bagels whatsoever, Fairmount Bagels is a must."
822,"Came for AYCE when a huge group of friends came to visit me and my cousin from Los Angeles. We used to live in the Spring Valley area and always passed this. So our big party went. \n\nSo I ordered for myself, thinking to start slow with what I can handle- 1 roll and nigiri and a tempura. Others followed suit with their orders- some not holding restraint on their orders and most are \""roll happy\"". So rolls started to come out....I found mine and happily ate it...then more rolls and more rolls that everyone else ordered. A few nigiri made it, but none were the pieces I ordered....only the basic, tuna, salmon etc someone else ordered...maybe 12 pieces and thats all we saw the whole night. So many rolls kept rolling in...so many in  fact that we had to cancel anything else we ordered to get through rolls on our table. A few we couldnt even figure out who the hell ordered it...if any of us ordered it at all!  I had to help everyone else eat their rolls so we dont get charged a la carte. I dont like rainbow rolls- I did not come to eat california roll with some fish on top! There was too much rice to me in the rolls, hence stuffing us all up.  I did not like how they did not pace us or bring each person what they ordered like other AYCE's do. I had no problem at places like Sushi Mon serving us as individuals in a group..and I like that when you order nigiri first then thats what you'll get...they dont \""forget\"" the order and skip to the rolls. \n\nThe server didnt look too happy with us too and was crabby serving us- this time I can't blame them. Normally me and my brother had to speak/apologize for the group. Mind you they dont know how to shut up most of them....they're so loud the deaf can hear it...but also we've never had ALL the loud ones in a group dinner with us...it was the complete symphony of cackling gays.  Kinda embarrassing and I apologize if you were there on a night a party of 12 gays were there with me and had to hear their bullshit. If I was any of you, I woulda slapped all of us. \n\nIt was just not a pleasant night at all and though my friends are asses, if the staff served like other AYCE's did we wouldnt have had problems with being roll overwhelmed. \n\nI still cant get near anything with crab or I gag and this was months ago. \n\nMaybe I'll come back as a friend said they really like the sushi chef here and is a regular, but I dunno.  Maybe the BF and I will come with the our friend who loves this place to give it a fair rating."

After hearing rave reviews from my friends, I finally decided to try this restaurant out for myself. I must say, it did not live up to the hype. While the outdoor patio was lovely and perfect for a leisurely meal, the wait to be seated was way too long. By the time we were finally seated, we were already feeling a little impatient and hungry. 

To make matters worse, the food wasn't anything to write home about. My beef with the meatloaf hash was that it was just bland. The biscuit, which should have been a highlight of the dish, had an uncooked flour taste that was a total turn off. And let's not forget about the Kiwi watermelon lemonade. While the combination sounded refreshing, it was anything but. The kiwi was sour and the watermelon lacked sweetness. It was more of a disappointment than a satisfying drink. 

But before you write this place off completely, let me tell you about the saving grace - my girlfriend's Sage Chicken. It was flavorful and the portion was huge, so I can see why she enjoyed it. And I have to admit, the food did taste fresh. But was it worth the long wait and subpar dishes? I have to say no. Maybe if we had come on a less busy day and tried different options, it could have been a better experience. 

But I have to give credit where credit is due. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty cool with great art on the walls, and our server Kyle was the best. He was super friendly and attentive, making our dining experience a little more enjoyable. Overall, I'd say this place has potential, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe next time I'll stick to my usual burger and Caesar salad combo."

Rosatti's has been our go-to spot for pizza and calzones lately, and we definitely enjoy their offerings. The thin crust on their pizza is always crispy and flavorful, and their calzones are on point ‚Äì no overpowering ricotta here. Plus, we appreciate their commitment to using quality ingredients, which keeps us coming back for more.

It's worth noting that this location is for takeout and delivery only, so keep that in mind when planning your visit. But overall, if you're in the mood for some delicious pizza or a drool-worthy calzone, Rosatti's is definitely worth a try. Just maybe skip the ricotta."

The decor was lovely and the bar was a great spot to wait for a table. However, my experience at this restaurant quickly went downhill from there. The mojito I ordered was lackluster and lacked any real flavor. The food was mediocre at best, with the exception of the edamame which was surprisingly delicious. The shrimp dumplings were average and the chicken satay was bland unless dipped in the peanut sauce. The tuna and avocado roll was disappointingly small. The curry, while having a decent flavor, was too soupy for my liking. One of my favorite dishes, Singapore Noodles, was not on the menu and I would suggest the restaurant add it. Despite being half full, the noise level in the restaurant was extremely high, making it difficult to have a conversation. Overall, for the upscale prices, the experience was underwhelming and I would recommend going to a more casual restaurant with better quality food, such as Fujo's uptown. One of the biggest letdowns of the evening was the slow and unattentive service. Our server seemed more interested in chatting with other staff members than taking care of our needs. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant and suggest looking for other options in the area."

I have to say, I was not impressed at all with my experience at this airport. It was clear from the moment I stepped off the plane that there were some serious management issues going on. Our gate was delayed upon arrival, causing us to rush to make our connecting flight. And let me tell you, running through an airport is not my idea of a good time. But that was just the beginning of the chaos.

To make matters worse, our luggage was delayed by a whopping 45 minutes because there weren't enough ground crew and baggage handlers to handle the incoming flights. It was a complete mess and caused a huge headache for everyone involved. And this isn't the first time I've encountered such problems at this airport. It almost seems like a given that something will go wrong when I have to connect through Charlotte Douglas.

I understand that mishaps can happen, but it's clear that this airport is poorly managed and lacks proper staffing to handle the influx of travelers. I would strongly advise anyone to avoid this airport if possible. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the headache and stress. There are plenty of other airports to choose from that are much more efficient and reliable."
827,"The wings are great but sometimes the service is less the spectacular. On our last visit we were seated promptly but that's where the great service ended. It took about 5 minutes just to get water and about another 15 for straws. The staff looked like they were cleaning but it never appeared to get clean. So after we ordered the wings took longer than usual and another waitress brought them out (which is not a problem) but our server looked confused that we had food. That was also the last time we saw her. Never got refills and had to flag down someone after finishing and waiting for 15 minutes with empty baskets and drinks. Bdubs you have to step it up, you can't hope your wings make people forget lousy service!"
828,"This hotel is a world away from a 4 star hotel.  The bathroom was filthy, full of other people's hair and who knows what else.  The front desk said that the room had been recently remodeled, however; the tile in the bathroom was cracked and full of mold, the toilet was chipped  and the plastic seat was very uncomfortable.  The complimentary shampoo etc was worse than a person would receive at a Motel 6 and the toilet paper was single ply, most rest areas on the highway have better..  The swimming pool was closed however; the hot tub was open which was also very dirty, full of leaves and cigarette butts.  Extremely disappointing."
829,"Wow, I don't know if I ever ranked a place this low. But I feel it is important to note the quality of service and food you'll receive here.\n\nWe began our night hoping for a reservation across the parking lot. When they were full we Yelped and found Marrakech right here so we gave it a shot. We were with a large group of 10 and were sat pretty quickly, about 15 minutes which was nice compared to the hour plus wait we left to come here. \n\nThe music was very loud and we requested it to be at a more realistic level so we could talk during their 5-6 course meal. It would have been strange to sit there that long and not be able to talk at all. Every 45 minutes or so they had a belly dancing show with even louder music, which is fine since it's not too often and made for the experience overall.\n\nIt took a while (15 to get our initial drinks) where we ordered wines. Even longer yet to receive any food such as apatizers or bread. We acctually had to ask to receive something after another 20 minutes of receiving our drinks. \n\nThe first place received was breads, humus, olives, etc. which was fine and the last quality food brought out. I won't go into the details of each dish to follow only to say for the expense we were not happy at all. \n\nThe wait staff was pleasant but very slow and lacked understanding of the level of sound and need to communicate ones there.\n\nThe place is neat looking inside and the concept is fun. Just won't be returning since food and service is too important."

Gave this place a shot based on the positive reviews, but man, was I disappointed. The wait to be seated was ridiculous, and once we finally sat down, it took forever for our food to come out. And let me tell you, it was not worth the wait. The pad thai was bland and clearly not freshly made. Even worse, the bok choy in my dish was completely overcooked and mushy. I don't understand how they could mess up such a simple dish. And don't even get me started on the prices. For the amount we paid, the quality of the food was definitely not up to par. The only thing that saved this experience were the delicious cocktails and coffee. But honestly, I could have just gone to a bar for those. Save your money and go somewhere else for better food and service."

I was excited to try out this Chipotle location, as I have been to many other ones and always enjoyed my experience. However, this visit left a bad taste in my mouth (literally). My husband and I both ordered our usuals - a bowl for me and a burrito for him - but were dismayed by the portion sizes. I couldn't believe how small the amount of beans, meat, and cheese were in my bowl. It was almost comical. And my husband's burrito was no better, with barely enough filling to make it worth the price. We were both left hungry and disappointed. I couldn't help but think that the guy preparing our food was trying to save on costs, but at the expense of our satisfaction. I will give this location another chance, but if the portion sizes continue to be this small for the price, I will definitely not be back. Good food is one thing, but skimping on ingredients just to save a few bucks is not acceptable. "
832,"Ok I am going to start off by creating the scene for you all. Denny's is never on the list for a breakfast spot, but since we were on a job that was miles away from anything but a Dennys, we decided...What the hell. First off its always annoying being seated at a table between two huge families full of bratty, carpet munching, screaming children when the rest of the entire restaurant is empty..Browsing the menu in which even in the pictures of the food, the food still looks shitty... in rolls a man in a wheelchair with his leg literally sawed off at the knee. It wasnt bandaged or covered, just there for everyone to enjoy over breakfast. Our waitress hobbles over and we are assuming she is pulling a double after working the night shift. I order the 2 egg breakfast and my hubs orders the western omelet. When the food comes it seems not only the plate, my coffee cup and the food are all the same color. There is no color, no flavor, and no life to this food. Basically whatever ihop throws away, dennys recooks  and serves it to customers. So we are sitting there basically separating our food with forks, and even only after taking a few bites I wish to God I could force myself to throw up. Slowly my energy is being sucked out of me as my body tries to digest this salted load of crap...when the raging gas begins. I will tell you the only fun reason to go to Denny's, is they have the perfect \""Pleather\"" to really let your farts rip roar and soar."

My friends and I stumbled upon this place while looking for a budget-friendly breakfast spot outside of our hotel. We were quickly seated on the patio and our drink order was taken by a polite but not overly friendly waiter. Despite the slow delivery of our drinks, we were willing to overlook it and enjoy our morning. However, things quickly went downhill when our meals arrived. My wife's order, a bagel that was apparently unavailable, was not communicated to us until after everyone else's food had been brought out. An alternate bagel was ordered and eventually delivered halfway through our meals by a different server who seemed in a hurry and didn't even offer an apology for the wait. The food itself was decent, but the portion sizes did not justify the high prices. We were left feeling unimpressed and wishing we had opted for a different spot. If you happen to find yourself at Mandalay Bay, I would recommend trying Raffles Cafe instead. Their prices may not be cheap, but at least they provide a generous portion and better service than what we experienced here. Considering the overall experience, I would give this place 3 stars."

Having heard great things about this Mexican restaurant, we decided to give it a try. The complimentary chips and salsa were indeed delicious, but unfortunately, that was the only highlight of our dining experience. The fajitas that I ordered were completely overcooked, lacking any flavor or spice that I had hoped for. My friend's burrito was also disappointing, receiving only an unenthusiastic ""ehh"" from them. We were left wishing we had just taken our chips to go and headed to our usual spot, Azteca. Plus, to add insult to injury, the three drink maximum policy just seemed ridiculous. I mean, who wants to be limited on drinks while trying to enjoy a meal? Needless to say, our disappointment with the food and restrictions will definitely prevent us from returning to this restaurant."
835,"With the recent popularity and boom of ramen joints around Vegas, my expectations for Shoku were probably a tad higher than they should have been. Upon entering, there was no music playing, and the lack of chatter among customers made the place seem a little awkwardly quiet (jazz music began playing a little later, though).\n\nThe waitresses were obviously new and/or inexperienced. I ordered the spicy miso and my friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a side of gyoza. The waitress confidently presented our respective dishes - dishes that we almost immediately realized were switched. That could have just been a little mistake instead of a lack of knowledge, though.\n\nThe ramen was what ultimately made me decide to give Shoku three stars. I chose my noodles \""firm\"" and didn't expect to find a thick clump of noodles still stuck together in the middle of my meal. The chashu was not the soft texture I was used to, which made me a little disappointed.The broth was actually better than expected though - not too salty with a decent kick of spice. It was nice that ramen already came with a few toppings as well.\n\nThe gyoza were meh. They probably would have tasted better if they were hot and fresh but instead seemed cold and dejected. \n\nOn a random note, I was childishly fascinated with the sesame grinder they had on the table. The tables were also nice and clean and new. I spent a good 5 minutes stroking it...\n\nAll in all, Shoku is just okay. We decided to stop by only because we were already sort of in the area but if I were to choose, I would not go out of my way when there are so many ramen places closer to my house."
836,"Ate lunch here today, was a little disappointed in the price of the food and not real tasty. The Greek lemon rice soup was more of a lemon rice chowder, beware it is a bit salty but has huge lemon flavor. Also ordered the spinach cakes from the app menu.  I have had them numerous places before and they usually are delicious but not here, they did not have enough if any cheese in them and they were very greasy, which they should not be.  Also for $7.00 I expected much more than two small pieces.  The Lamb Kabob was just okay, the pita bread this time was not home made but store bought, bummer and the spices on the lamb did not really bring out the flavor.  The owner was okay, a smile or two and he warmed right up. Spending $25.00 for 2 apps and a kabob seemed very high considering the food was just so so if that much.  We will not be back"

""While the gyro and hummus at this place were on point, I couldn't help but feel disappointed with the rest of my experience. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was run-down and lacking in charm. The bathrooms were in need of some serious cleaning and the popcorn was stale and unappetizing. Additionally, the lack of reserved seating was a major inconvenience, especially when trying to attend an event. Our gyro maker was also a bit inconsistent, with one providing a perfect balance of toppings and meat, while the other overloaded the sandwich with unnecessary lettuce and tomatoes. Overall, not a terrible place for a quick gyro fix, but not worth venturing out for anything else."""

Portion of meat was large but the meat itself lacked flavor, and sandwiches were dry without any condiments.  \n\nWould have asked for mustard, but service is incredibly lacking.

Although we had a great experience with the food at this restaurant, the service left much to be desired. Our server seemed to have disappeared after taking our order and we had to flag down another employee to ask for refills on our drinks. It took almost an hour for our appetizers to arrive and when they did, they were cold and stale. We were hoping that the main courses would make up for it, but unfortunately, they were just as disappointing. The spaghetti and meatballs were overcooked and the sauce was flavorless. The pizza was soggy and lacked any toppings. To top it off, our server never came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. It's a shame because the atmosphere was cozy and the outdoor seating had a beautiful view. But the poor service and underwhelming food made for a disappointing dining experience. We won't be returning to this location."

When I visited this place, I was expecting to be transported to the tropical paradise of Hawaii with their name being ""#1 Hawaiian food."" However, I was disappointed to find out that not a single person working there was actually Hawaiian. And to make matters worse, the food was far from authentic Hawaiian cuisine. In fact, the girl up front seemed clueless when my friend asked about the chicken dish. The rice was not the sticky and flavorful texture I was hoping for, but rather hard and unappetizing. And don't even get me started on the macaroni salad, which lacked any real flavor. It's clear that this place is simply trying to pass off generic Asian food as Hawaiian cuisine. I would much rather stick to the true Hawaiian gems in town, like Ross J's or Aloha Specialties. Plus, the fact that this place was overpriced just adds insult to injury. Save your money and go elsewhere for a taste of real Hawaiian food."

They know people are in a desparate situation needing to get their car fixed and not able to fork out $2000, so they take advantage of the situation.

The hype surrounding this place had me excited to try it out, but unfortunately, my experience fell flat. While the burgers were decent, they were nothing to write home about. I've had better at other burger joints. The real disappointment was the lack of hygiene and professionalism I witnessed from the staff. As someone who works in the food industry, seeing an employee eating behind the counter made me lose my appetite. It was unpleasant and unappetizing. I won't be returning to this establishment and I definitely won't be recommending it to anyone. It's a shame, because the customer service was actually quite good, but that one incident was enough to make me never want to come back. Looks like the search for the perfect burger joint continues."

I don't even know where to begin with this place. I remember hearing about Chompie's and thinking it would be a great spot for some delicious, authentic Jewish deli food. I couldn't have been more wrong. Why don't they just call it ""Meh-pie's"" because that's exactly what it is - meh.

I first went here for breakfast and let me tell you, I've had better food at a greasy spoon diner. The portions were huge, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. The quality was severely lacking and I found myself longing for my usual go-to spot. But the real kicker was when the hostess told me I couldn't bring in my own coffee from Circle K. Excuse me, but do you see this amazing go-cup in my hand? Apparently, it was against ""health department reasons."" Insert eye roll here.

But of course, I didn't let that ruin my experience. I decided to give Chompie's another shot and try some of their baked goods. Let me just say, I was not impressed. The prices were ridiculous and the taste was underwhelming, to say the least. The only saving grace were those little chocolate-dipped butter cookies. I could eat pounds of those, no joke. But that's about the only thing I'll come back for.

Overall, I wouldn't waste your time or money at this place. The food is just meh and the service is downright ridiculous. Save yourself the disappointment and find a better deli spot in town. Trust me, you'll thank me later."

Our experience at this restaurant was overall disappointing. Despite being excited to try their famous fried fish and chicken options for our 4th of July dinner, we were let down by the lack of flavor and obvious pre-frozen and bulk-purchased ingredients. It felt like we were having a meal at a nursing home rather than a restaurant. The only thing that kept us from completely regretting our choice was the delightful server who provided great service. To make matters worse, the atmosphere of the place was ruined by the prominent placement of their dumpster in the parking area, leading to unpleasant smells wafting in while we dined. It's a shame because the Italian feel of the restaurant had potential, but fell flat in execution. If you do choose to dine here, I suggest avoiding the ""schtick"" of family style entrees and opting for smaller portions instead."

After a long day of exploring the Las Vegas Strip, my friends and I decided to take a break and check out Ellis Island Brewery. It was just a few blocks away from our hotel, but boy were those few blocks hot! As we approached the brewery, I couldn't help but think that it looked pretty run-down. The exterior was lackluster and the interior wasn't much better. However, we were pleasantly surprised by the experience we had inside.

We took a seat at the bar and asked for a flight of their beers. But instead of charging us, the bartender generously offered to let us try all of the beers. And let me tell you, they were all light and refreshing. None of them were phenomenal, but none of them were terrible either. As a lover of craft root beers, I was overjoyed to see that they also had a homemade version. And the best part? The prices were incredibly affordable and the service was top-notch.

Despite the initial appearance, Ellis Island Brewery turned out to be a hidden gem. With delicious, inexpensive beers and friendly service, I would definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area. Just be prepared for a hot walk there and back!"

We went to this restaurant during the Sunday brunch rush and had to wait 30 minutes for a table. To make the wait easier, the waitstaff took down our names and phone number and we were able to track our place in line through their nowaitapp. How cool is that? We were so fascinated by the constantly updating page that we got our table before we even realized it! However, once we were seated, things went downhill. The lighting was cozy and the variety of hot sauces displayed on the table was impressive. But the food was disappointing. My eggs benedict with jalapeno bacon was just a biscuit with a few slices of bacon and cheese on top. The house potatoes were a small portion and barely had any flavor. The fruit cup that came with it was also surprisingly small with only a few pieces of fruit. Granted, the fruit was ripe and sweet, but for the price of $13, I would have expected a larger portion. The communication from our server was also lacking as we waited for our food for 30 minutes, while people who arrived after us received their meals first. Overall, the atmosphere was nice, but the service and food were a letdown. "
851,"This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price."

Our stay at this hotel was anything but pleasant. Despite the beautiful lobby and quick check-in process, the inconveniences started to pile up. We were asked to switch rooms for an unknown reason, and when we finally settled into our new room, disaster struck. Within minutes, the water alarm went off and our room was flooded, ruining my business partner's $2000 suit and leaving us both in shock. Instead of apologizing, the staff simply moved us to a different room and attempted to dry-clean the damaged garment. Surprise, surprise, the dress was beyond repair and the hotel took no responsibility for the mess. To make matters worse, the next day we found over $13,000 worth of charges on our credit card that we were told were our fault for the water alarm incident. Let's just say, the lack of customer service at this supposedly nice hotel was beyond unacceptable. We will not be returning and will be taking legal action. Don't make the same mistake we did and avoid this hotel at all costs."

I had a very disappointing experience here. We booked two rooms, one of which was supposed to be handicap accessible. However, this ""accessible"" room was located in the middle of a long hallway corridor, which made it difficult for my family members with walking issues to reach. Also, the room was located quite far from the parking lot, which was an inconvenience. On top of that, the air conditioning stopped working at midnight and even though we called for help, it took the service personnel two hours to arrive and another hour to fix it. This really disrupted our sleep and it was a big disappointment. 

At checkout, I expressed my concerns to the staff but they seemed dismissive and refused to make eye contact. They simply said they would look into it with no apology. The only positive aspect of the room was the walk-in shower. However, that does not make up for all the issues we faced. 

As someone who has family members with handicap issues, I am extremely disappointed in this hotel's lack of attention to accessibility and maintenance issues. It makes me rethink staying here again in the future. I would advise anyone with similar needs to choose a different hotel. There are plenty of other options in the area that would better accommodate and treat their guests with respect and care. "

I have visited many churches in the area, but I must say, this one stands out from the rest. The diverse community at this church creates a welcoming and inviting atmosphere. As soon as you step in, it feels like you're at a concert with a positive and uplifting energy. Pastor Paul and Pastor Denise are truly a dynamic team, and their leadership radiates through their welcoming demeanor. They have an amazing team of leaders who are always available to connect with. 

I appreciate the variety of bible study groups available for all ages on Wednesday's at 7pm. It's a great opportunity to dive deeper into the teachings and connect with others in the community. As for the Sunday services, there are three options at 9am, 11am, and 6pm, making it convenient for all schedules. The church's website, iclv.com, provides all the necessary information for anyone interested. 

However, my experience wasn't all perfect. One thing I would note is the limited parking space. It can be quite challenging finding a spot, especially during peak times. Additionally, the Sunday services can get quite crowded, and it can be difficult to find a seat. I also wish there were more activities and programs offered throughout the week to stay connected with the church and community. 

Overall, I highly recommend this church to anyone looking for a dynamic and exciting place of worship. From their generous and giving nature to their transparent and welcoming community, this church has it all. After just one visit, I guarantee you'll be coming back for more. And who knows, maybe you'll even be able to find a parking spot next time!"
856,"This is the worst truck wash I have been to in 27 years in the trucking business. Please don't waste your money and a lot of your time here. The employees are screwing off, walking around and too lazy to scrub, only power wash. The guy supposedly in charge sent someone else out to look at the dirty left on my truck when I complained. That wash Josh in case the owner would like to fire someone. They have music cranked up so loud in the truck bays they can't hear you say what services you would like. I'm just sorry I had to leave a one star rating. They are at-3 stars."
857,"The Olive Tree was a pleasant caffeine stop before my band's late night gig recently in Edinburgh. We were attracted by the exterior which was welcoming and cosey! Upon arriving, it seemed the staff were surprised to see us! And it was empty besides a couple having food. We didn't let this put us off and indulged in some lattes!\n\nDespite being almost empty, a few of the tables were yet to be cleaned and that the staff still stood idly by. The cakes looked lovely but the cabinet wasn't the cleanest either which made us reluctant to come back and try them. \n\nThe toilet consisted of one large room which was dirty and lacking in toilet roll. Otherwise, my chai latte was lovely!"

So let me start by saying, I had high hopes for Durant's. The atmosphere was definitely classy and the booths were as comfortable as I had heard. We decided to stop in for a drink around 11:30pm, thinking it would be the perfect spot for a nightcap. Unfortunately, our plans were quickly derailed when we saw the prices on the menu. While the drinks were good, they were definitely overpriced for what they were. And to make matters worse, when we asked for some potatoes as a side dish, we were told they didn't have any. As a vegetarian, I was disappointed that the only option for me was a bowl of mashed potatoes. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty, but not worth the steep price. Even the luxurious atmosphere couldn't make up for the lackluster menu options. To top it off, the service was not up to par. Our bartender seemed disinterested and was not very friendly. In fact, we felt like we were a bother to him. It's a shame, because we were hoping to have a nice dining experience at Durant's. But unfortunately, with the high prices and subpar service, we won't be rushing back anytime soon. There are plenty of other classy spots in town that offer delicious food and top-notch service. "

The grilled cheese definitely had potential, but ultimately fell short. It lacked the ooey gooey cheese goodness that I was expecting and for the price, I expected a little more. And don't even get me started on the ""Ultimate"" part of its name. As for the veg soup, it was enjoyable but left me wanting it piping hot instead of lukewarm. However, for an extra charge, you can add toppings like croutons or cheddar. The salad was also a bit of a letdown with a surplus of lettuce and a scarcity of chicken. I appreciate the healthier options, but not at the cost of flavor. At lunchtime, I want a meal that will fill me up and leave me feeling satisfied and unfortunately, this wasn't it. For the price I paid, I could have easily gone to my favorite deli or bakery and had a more satisfying meal. Looks like this won't be my new go-to spot."

After moving into my new apartment at this complex, I had high hopes based on the initial reviews and the location seemed perfect. However, as my first two months have passed, I can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the grounds are well-kept and I've yet to encounter any pesky bugs. But the overall atmosphere is eerily quiet and lacking in energy. 

Now, don't even get me started on the partially upgraded units. Sure, they may look nice, but the price doesn't quite match the quality. And let's be real, a few cosmetic upgrades don't make up for the lack of a true ""wow"" factor. In fact, I've found myself dozing off a few times. And as for the plot? Well, let's just say it's a bit odd and unclear. 

I've heard great things about nearby places like Zipps Sports Grill and Butters, but I haven't been impressed with the neighboring establishments. And while the Green Belt bike path may lead to some fun activities, it's not exactly convenient to have to bike a few miles just to get there. Plus, the constant threat of cars makes it less than ideal. 

On the bright side, I haven't encountered many smokers in the area (thank goodness!) and any minor issues I've had were handled quickly. However, compared to my previous living situations, this place just doesn't live up to the hype. Overall, I'd say save your money and look elsewhere for a more lively and exciting experience."

I've been to Los Mesquites twice now and both times were for different occasions. The location is perfect, just on the outskirts of downtown, making it easy to access but away from the hustle and bustle. Last time, I stumbled upon this place while getting tattooed nearby and thought ""why not grab some food afterwards?"" Turns out, it was the perfect spot for a quick lunch and drink. 

I must say, the food was definitely the highlight of my visit. As a self-proclaimed lover of Mexican cuisine, I was pleased to find that they make their own chips and salsa. The salsa had a mild heat to it, with hints of fire-roasted tomato and mexican oregano - a perfect combination for those who can't handle too much spice. And to all my fellow cilantro haters out there, you'll be happy to know that this salsa is cilantro-free. 

As for the main courses, my wife went for the grilled chicken taco salad and loved every bite. The shell was freshly made and the portion was very generous for a lunch size. We both appreciated the fact that they didn't skimp on the lettuce, unlike some other places we've been to. I, on the other hand, opted for the Chile Relleno and was pleasantly surprised. It had the perfect level of spice, a lightly fried batter that wasn't too greasy, and the highlight was definitely the homemade corn tortilla that it came in. Thick and flavorful, it was the perfect vessel for the carne asada taco. Safe to say, I'll be ordering more dishes that come wrapped in these tortillas next time I visit.

Now, let's talk about the service. While the staff and owner were all very friendly and accommodating, the service itself was a bit disorganized. It's understandable, given that they recently opened, but some tables were getting their food much quicker than others, causing a bit of a wait time discrepancy. However, our server was wonderful and made up for any small service hiccups we encountered.

Overall, Los Mesquites is a great addition to the Mexican food scene here. While there are a few kinks to work out, the food itself definitely earns a solid four stars in my book. Plus, I can't wait to go back for karaoke night - because who doesn't love singing their heart out after a delicious meal? "
862,"

My recent visit was a major disappointment. While the chips and salsa were decent, the service was abysmal. Our server seemed to have completely forgotten about us as we waited for our food to come out. And once it finally did arrive, it was just okay. Nothing to rave about and definitely not worth the wait. It's no wonder the place is always busy - it's probably the only thing keeping them afloat. But even with the crowds, the quality of the food and service just don't measure up. Maybe it was just a bad day, but with so many other dining options in the area, I'm not sure I'll be giving this place another chance. "

""Stopped by The Duce for a Friday night out with friends. The atmosphere was a little disappointing, as it was pretty dead and we were expecting more of a lively crowd. However, we did get to enjoy their karaoke night, which was entertaining. The only downside was that the music was a bit too loud for the small amount of people there.

One thing I appreciated was their unique fusion concept. They had a little bit of everything, from clothing and bags for sale, to an ice cream and juice bar. I even got to release some tension by hitting the boxing ring and punching bag - definitely a fun activity after a few drinks!

Speaking of drinks, their old fashioned cocktails were delicious. I highly recommend trying the grasshopper - it was like a chocolate mint patty in a glass. Yum! The prices were reasonable, but I have to admit that the heat did put a damper on our night. It was way too hot, despite the ""big ass fan"" being on full blast. I know Phoenix had a record August this year, but installing misters would definitely make a huge difference.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at The Duce, but I do think it could use some more promotion and marketing to bring in a bigger crowd. It's a cool spot with lots to offer, but with the lack of people and intense heat, I don't see myself making it a regular spot. Maybe once in a while when I'm in the area and feeling nostalgic for that mint patty cocktail."""

BUYER BEWARE!!! After my experience with this company, I feel compelled to warn others to proceed with caution. While their staff may be knowledgeable in their trade, their customer service and communication skills leave much to be desired. \n\nAfter scheduling a garage door repair, which unfortunately required multiple visits due to internal miscommunication within the company, I was disappointed to discover that three of my tactical weapon knives were mysteriously missing. Naturally, I immediately reached out to the business owner to address this issue. \n\nHowever, despite multiple attempts to contact the owner, I was met with indifference and a dismissive attitude. The owner even went as far as to claim that I had no evidence of his staff taking the knives. This lack of accountability and blatant disregard for customer satisfaction is concerning, to say the least. \n\nAs a result, I have filed a formal police report and lodged complaints with various licensing and consumer agencies. It is a shame that the quality of their work is overshadowed by their unprofessionalism and disregard for their customers' possessions. BUYER BEWARE of this company, and make sure to keep a close eye on your belongings during their visits."
865,"Simply property management replied to my posting....but look at the other comments.  It isn't just me.  I just got back from Phoenix and my tenant told me that he had a really hard time renting the property as Simply property management was unresponsive to his requests to see the house for over 2 weeks.  He finally had to call his real estate person and have them show him the house.  Then he said that Simply property management was mad at him since they needed to pay him a commission.  Simply property management sent in maintenance people to do some calking and they stood on the toilet seat breaking the seat and bolts, then they charged me for the broken seat. Although I had personally gone down and cleaned the house with a cleaning service, when the tenant finally saw the house he said it was dirty with hair all over the stairs....it looked like someone had stayed there or had a long haired animal (possibly a workman?). Also, they were supposed to have a refrigerator put in, and they charged me a delivery charge, charged double for the refrigerator, but while delivering it, it fell or was dropped leaving a huge dent in the top and was VERY dirty. REMEMBER, it is now April.  They collected rent and deposits in January and I have still not received one cent!!!!  No matter what they say, collecting money from a tenant and not sending it to the owner is NOT acceptable.  They continue to hold my money hostage, saying they are going to charge an early termination fee and a year of \""computer\"" charge even though THEY CANCELLED ME!  Thank God they did, as it moved me to action."
866,"I recently visited this restaurant for breakfast with some out of town friends. As we were looking for a place to catch up, we decided to give this place a try since it was nearby and seemed to offer a more unique menu than the usual breakfast joints.

Sadly, our experience fell short of expectations. The restaurant was filled with mainly families, which made for a loud and bustling atmosphere. The wait for our breakfast dishes was quite long and when we finally received them, they were underwhelming. My avocado toast was bland and the poached eggs were overcooked. My friends' meals were similarly lackluster.

To make matters worse, the service was disappointing. Our server seemed overwhelmed and it took multiple attempts to flag them down for drink refills. And when we asked about the wait time for our food, they simply shrugged and said ""it's busy today."" No apology or acknowledgement of the delay.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a leisurely catch-up breakfast with friends. It seemed more geared towards families and the food and service were subpar. While it may be convenient for locals, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. There are plenty of other breakfast spots in the area that offer better quality food and service."

I used to have such fond memories of this place back in the late 90s and early 2000s. My friends and I would come here often and rave about the amazing food. But my recent visit was a total disappointment. I convinced my boyfriend to come with me, bragging about how good the food used to be. But I was sorely disappointed. The seafood had a strange, fishy taste and definitely did not taste fresh. I understand that we're not on the coast, but this was just not up to par. And to make matters worse, they no longer had some of their best menu items. It's such a shame to see this place go downhill. Needless to say, I won't be traveling across town and paying for subpar food anymore. Save your money and go somewhere else."
869,"Bought a groupon for dental cleaning because I haven't had one for 2 years, the cleaning was very light and ended shortly after it started. I would have given them 3 stars, but the staff obviously doesn't care for their patients, because I have now called 3 times over the past month to request a record of my X-ray be sent to my email (so it's 100% cost free to them) and have gotten NO response. I even obtained their email address on the phone (so I know it's the right one) and emailed my request, still nothing. It seems to me like they're purposely delaying my request to prevent me from seeking dental services from other providers, and that's just wrong coming from a medical establishment.  \n\nGuess I'll have to call every other day to get some attention. Until they email me my record, I'm not changing their rating. Avoid this place if you want to be treated like a human being."
870,"I reserved an Economy car online from Fox two months in advance.  When I arrived at  the Vegas Airport I had to go to the normal car rental shuttles. From there I rode to the Airport Car Rental Location. Then I had to walk to the cab area and wait for another shuttle from Fox. From there is was another 10 minute ride to Fox rental. At Fox rental office I was told that they didn't have any economy vehicles and that the only thing available was a 08 PT Cruiser. I expressesed to the agent that I didn't want a PT cruiser and that anything else wold work. He looked and got a set of keys but said it would cost $7 more perday for a differant car. PT cruiser wasn't even listed in their car list and had it been I would not have reserved with Fox. I ended up having to take the PT cruiser and was given a number to call to trade out cars if one was available. No one answered that number the next day. I finally had to spend 2 hours of my vacation on the phone talking to Fox Corporate. I was disconnected 3 times and it wasn't until I spoke with a supervisor that I was  able to get anything done. I had to drive back to the Rental to trade cars. Another hour of my vacation gone. They were very rude , at least the Scott that I spoke with and ended up giving me an even worst car with less gas mileage than the Cruiser. I think it wrong to advertise a class of car you don't even have, much less a make you don't advertise. When I returned home and checked the web on Fox I found that the rate I received should have given me a full sized car. The also refused to honor the car up grade coupon as well as one I had for 7% discount. I definately say if want to get a 3 year old PT Cruiser and be treated RUDELY this is you rental place.

I have to say, I was really excited to try this place out, especially since my uncle is the head chef. However, my experience was far from satisfying. I decided to load up on my favorite seafood dishes, specifically the crab and sashimi. And let me tell you, it was a huge letdown. The crab was bland and lacked any real flavor, and the sashimi was not as fresh as I had hoped. I've had better crab at cheaper seafood joints. And the sushi? Let's just say it tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. It's a shame, because I had high hopes for this place. Maybe if I try something else, like their signature dish or appetizer, my opinion will change. But for now, I won't be back. And trust me, I've had better seafood options for a much more reasonable price. So unless you have a personal connection to the chef, I would skip this spot."
873,"Okay, is it fair to write a review about a hotel that I spent approximately 8 hours in over the span of a 3 day period, either in an exhausted stupor or drunken haze??? Oh wait, this is normal for a Vegas vacation, right? \nCheck in here was a breeze at 4pm, and the lady was nice enough to change my room to a quieter location since she found that the room I had originally booked would have been next to the elevators. Thanks! The room was clean except for a few dubious stains on the floor, but I guess that comes with the territory. The biggest pro for me was how comfortable the beds were. Maybe it is the same when food tastes phenomenal after you have starved, but these beds were so comfortable that I felt rested even after 4 hours sleep. The biggest con for me was that it took 5 min for the water to heat in the shower. I was all about the ice cold showers after walking in the desert sun, but I don't like to wake up by freezing my arse off.\nTwo other bonuses were that they had a nice deli that was pretty cheap and the Paradise Cafe, open 24 hours, serves the yummiest breakfasts and has the nicest servers at 6am and they don't care if you are barefoot because your heels have worn a hole through your foot.\nOverall, this place is a great place to stay if you are there to see something at the hotel (I was there for the World Championship Muay Thai fights) or if you have a tight budget and don't mind being off the strip."

When we first walked into this place, we were greeted with a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. However, as the night went on, we couldn't help feeling a bit out of place. The restaurant was filled with what seemed like a ""cool crowd"", and we couldn't help but feel a bit envious of their perfectly styled hair and trendy outfits. Despite this uncomfortable feeling, we were excited to try the food. Unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed. My husband's turkey burger was not to his liking, and most of our dishes were served at room temperature or colder. However, the exceptional service from our server made up for the subpar meal. She was extremely personable and attentive, making our dining experience more enjoyable. We do plan on giving this place another chance, as it's more of a dive and we weren't expecting a lot. Plus, the bill was surprisingly affordable for the amount of food we had. Overall, it was a decent experience, but we're hoping for a better one the next time we visit."

878,"Yelp Challenge 2013: 36 /100 (....more like 3.5 stars) \n\nI am Nicaraguan and I was excited to take my boyfriend here. I couldn't wait for him to finally try authentic 'Nica' food. I had bookmarked this place a while ago.  When I saw the recent review in the Las Vegas Weekly Magazine, we decided to make our move.\n\nThe food here is authentic, delicious, affordable, and cooked with love. In fact, Dona Norma was in the kitchen preparing the meals. However, this place is an absolute hole-in-the-wall.  When you first pull up, you might be turned off by the location (read: not in the best area of town) or the eclectic d\u00e9cor (tables with plastic coverings). Don't let it steer you away. I repeat, don't let it steer you away. If you're looking to try something new, look past the exterior and give it shot.   \n\n\nHere is what I suggest you try:\n\n~ Cacao: Made with milk, cacao beans, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. \n\n~Fritanga Plate: This was my personal favorite. The plate included an assortment of carne asada (charbroiled beef), gallo pinto (rice and red beans seasoned with garlic), platanos maduros (sweet fried plantains), platanos fritos (plantain chips), traditional cabbage coleslaw, and queso frito (fried cheese that is traditionally salty and dry).\n\n~Nacatamale: Made with Masa de maiz (dough made of grinded corn and butter) , olives,  tomatoes, onions, potatoes, filled with pork and vegetables and steamed in a banana leaf.\n\nThe service was fairly good. There was only one guy waiting, busing, expediting, and running payment for orders. The restaurant was busy and the service was a bit slow. However, our waiter was very kind and he was really trying his best to attend to all the tables in a timely fashion. I really can't knock em' for trying their best. Come in with the mindset that this is run like a typical restaurant in Nicaragua.  \n\nIt is also important to note that Spanish is the first language at this place. The waiter spoke English, but I'm pretty sure he was the only one working who did. For those who don't speak Spanish, their menu includes English descriptions and photos. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal at Dona Norma. I am very happy to know that there is traditional Nicaraguan food available in Las Vegas. The place is not fancy, but sometimes you'll find some amazing food at places like this. We will be back."

I was not impressed with my experience at this newly renovated restaurant, now known as the Grand Cafe. The moment I walked in, I could tell something was off. Turns out, this place used to be Coco's, which had a much better reputation in my opinion. But I decided to give it a shot, and boy was I disappointed.

First of all, the menu prices were reasonable, but I couldn't help feeling like I was being scammed. Maybe it was because of the fancy decor and the new paintings on the wall, but something just didn't feel right. And then it hit me, the service charge was included in my bill. But that's not all, when I asked about it, they said it was to cover their Google advertising fee. How low can a business go to charge their customers extra for their own marketing expenses?

But let's talk about the food. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with seasoned fries, and it was just basic. Nothing special, nothing unique, just a plain old burger. Maybe I would have enjoyed the prime rib special, but it was already past 11pm so they didn't have it anymore. And to make matters worse, the service was just average. My drink was refilled, but that's pretty much all I can say about it.

Overall, I was disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. I heard good things about Coco's, but this place did not live up to its former reputation. The only positive thing I can say is that the service was decent. But with so many other options in the area, I would recommend avoiding this place and finding another restaurant to dine at. Save yourself the trouble and stay away."

The sushi here definitely lives up to the hype, but that's about all I can say for this place. While the food and ambiance are great, the service and overall experience fell short for me. My boyfriend and I came here for a date night and were both disappointed with the Long Island Ice Teas - they were incredibly watered down and not a great start to the evening. And things didn't improve from there. The onion rings came out burnt and my rib eye was dry and overcooked. Meanwhile, my date's filet was cooked perfectly. Talk about inconsistency. And let's not even get started on the cowboy beans - they were an absolute disaster, I couldn't finish them. The only saving grace was the nicely done corn on the cob. As for service, our server, Adrian, seemed overwhelmed by the busy atmosphere. While he was nice, the slow service did not make up for the mediocre food. I will say that the views from the patio are amazing and great for people watching. However, the decor change (from blue to red) combined with the already busy atmosphere was a bit too much. And speaking of the other patrons, the ""bros"" and ""cougars"" are definitely entertaining to watch, but I wouldn't bring my parents here. I've been here with a group of friends and even by myself for lunch, but I don't think I'd bring my parents - they'd be too embarrassed by the lack of clothing on some people. One time, I came with a party of 45 and the back patio was able to accommodate us, but the service was still lacking. Overall, I would recommend this place for the sushi and views, but don't expect exceptional service or a high-quality dining experience."

As soon as I walked into this place, I knew I was in trouble. The lighting was so low that they had to rely on blaring disco lights to see anything. It was like being at a poorly run nightclub, except this was supposed to be a restaurant. And let me tell you, the food did not live up to even the most basic of expectations. I mean, how hard is it to serve food that is hot? Apparently, it's too difficult for this place. Every single one of our dishes came out cold. I couldn't believe it. And as if that wasn't bad enough, they had gall to charge me $6 for a simple salsa refill. Talk about disrespecting your customers. The only redeeming quality of this place was the strong drinks, but let's be real, for $10 a pop, they better be strong. And to make matters worse, the bartenders were completely clueless. It took two of them to figure out how to run a credit card, while we waited for service. Thank goodness for the one competent bartender who actually seemed to know what he was doing. The manager had the audacity to charge for chips and salsa when the rest of our meal was subpar, but it's no wonder they have to nickel and dime their customers with cold, tasteless food. The only saving grace of this disaster of a dining experience was the cool atmosphere and the friendly hostesses. But that's not enough to make up for the lack of basic competence in the kitchen. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague."

I was really excited to try out this location for some delicious Mexican food, but the last two visits have left me feeling disappointed. On both occasions, the meat options that I wanted were not available. I mean, seriously? How hard is it to have the basics ready to go?

Last Thursday night, I stopped by at 9:20 and was told that there was no steak available for my burrito. The employee informed me that it would take about eight minutes for the steak to be ready. I didn't want to wait that long, so I decided to come back another time. Then this Saturday, I stopped by at 11:30 AM and asked for chicken tacos. To my surprise, the container for chicken was completely empty. The order taker apologized and said it would be about four minutes until the chicken was ready. I decided to wait this time, and when I finally got my tacos, they were decent.

But honestly, I expected better from this place. How can they not have their basics ready during their business hours? It's frustrating and it makes me question the overall quality of their food. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope that they can get their act together soon. But for now, I think I'll pass on coming back anytime soon."

I used to be a regular at Villa's for their fresh and tasty food, but my recent experiences have been nothing but disappointing. It seems like the quality has significantly declined. The last two times I ordered, the food was almost spoiled and definitely not fresh-made as it used to be. It was clear that they were just heating up pre-made food in the microwave. As someone who loves their marinated pork tacos, I was extremely disappointed to find that the meat was rancid. When I brought it to the attention of the staff, they didn't seem to care and just gave a nonchalant apology. After wasting my time and money on two terrible meals, my trust in this place has completely diminished. I will not be returning to Villa's and I caution others to avoid it as well. Don't waste your money on subpar food and lackluster service."
886,"I've come here on 3 occassions. All of them were because I was hungry and nothing else was open. Did what I had to do to survive. \n\nThe food isn't necessarily bad but it's not good either. It's very much ... it's hard to describe. Let me back up.\n\nI've dined here during the late night hours around midnight. You would think it would be slow considering the time but that is far from the case. Again, due to other sit down places being  closed at midnight, Perkin generates business for this reason alone. They serve typical diner food, breakfast, finger food, burgers, soups, etc. There are usually 2 servers working the entire diner. Services while good is very slow because waiters are working hard to be at more than one place at one time which is impossible. I give them credit for being as good as they are for that. Also, kudos to them for being professional. I've seen some extremely rude diners and they kept their composure. \n\nFood again isn't bad but it's your typical late night diner food. It serves it purpose for filling you up but it's nothing that is the finest quality. They are better known for their bakery. Once, I had a muffin and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Their pies and other pastries really do look appetizing I must admit and to be diner made, they are good. \n\nOverall, Perkins serves it purpose. To be a diner that stays open 24 hours and feeds people decent food."

During my visit to this iconic arena, I had mixed experiences. The staff at the service desk were friendly and welcoming, making it easy to navigate the crowd and find my seat. However, I was a bit taken aback by the lack of excitement or enthusiasm from the staff. As I approached the counter, the service person simply asked me what I wanted and proceeded to handle my transaction without much interaction or engagement. While efficient, it left me feeling a bit awkward and hoping for a more personable experience.

The overall atmosphere of the arena was fantastic. The energy of the crowd was infectious and made for an unforgettable game. I loved the layout of the arena, it reminded me of the old Chicago Stadium days. The intimate setting allowed for a great view of the ice without breaking the bank. I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable prices for food and drinks as well.

The only slight downside was that after my excitement from the game calmed down, I noticed a few small bird droppings that had not been properly cleaned during the arena's quick turnaround between events. While it didn't ruin my experience, it was a bit disappointing to have to clean my car again once I got home.

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it to others. Hopefully, I will have the chance to visit again during the Finals. Go Hawks!"

I was visiting Pittsburgh with my fiance and we decided to check out this casino during our trip. While we were excited to try our luck at the slots and possibly catch a game at PNC Park, we were disappointed with our experience at this casino.

Highlights:
1. Convenient location - close to PNC Park and other attractions in the city.
2. Variety of games - there were a good amount of slot machines to choose from.
3. Decent food options - we grabbed a quick bite to eat at one of the restaurants and it was decent enough.

Unfortunate aspects:
1. Tight slots - we didn't have much luck with the machines and noticed that others around us were also having a hard time.
2. Crowd - the atmosphere felt a bit rundown and the majority of patrons appeared to be locals who were not dressed for a night out.

Overall, while we enjoyed the convenience and variety of games, we were not impressed with the overall atmosphere and the tight slots. It may be worth checking out for a quick stop, but I wouldn't make it a regular spot during my visits to Pittsburgh. "

After my first appointment went smoothly, I had high hopes for this office. But unfortunately, during my third visit, everything went downhill. Despite having a recurring issue, I was only able to see the D.O. for five minutes before being rushed out the door. And when I went to the front desk to inquire about my co-pay for the follow-up, I was met with extreme rudeness. To top it off, I had to reschedule because the necessary paperwork wasn't faxed over, and was told that I would have to pay another co-pay when I returned. I wouldn't wish this treatment on my worst enemy. Incredibly disappointed and won't be going back."

The service at this location was truly exceptional and made our dining experience here memorable. Our server, Richard, was friendly, helpful, and attentive throughout our meal. He even made some amazing guacamole for us to enjoy. I have to say, Richard's excellent service definitely bumped up this review from a 4-star to a 5-star. As for the food, it was delicious and my Latin boyfriend agreed that it was very authentic. The homemade tortillas were a standout and the steak and chicken fajitas were full of flavor. We had a fantastic time and will definitely be returning for more delicious and authentic dishes."

I decided to give Bellagio a try for a short stay while I was on a work trip. I've heard so much about this hotel, and being a 2-diamond hotel, I had high expectations. However, my experience was just okay.

The room itself was decent-sized and clean, but I was disappointed to find that there was no electrical kettle for me to make a cup of warm tea after a long day. I called the front desk, and they directed me to in-room dining where they wanted to charge me $4 for a cup of hot water! Are you kidding me? And the staff were not the friendliest either. I couldn't believe that such a basic item was not included in the room and I had to pay for it.

Speaking of basic items, I also found out that they don't provide room slippers or toothbrushes. I had to request for those, which I found a bit strange for a hotel with such high reputation. Are they trying to cut costs? Not to mention, the front desk staff seemed quite snobbish when I asked about these items.

On the bright side, the fountain and casino were great to visit even if you're not staying at the hotel. But honestly, there are many newer and nicer hotels in Vegas that I would rather stay at for my next trip. Mon Ami Gabi was a great option for dinner, and of course, I couldn't resist the free fountain show. But as for Bellagio, you won't be getting a single penny from me."
892,"Love original Barrio Cafe and Barrio Queen in Scottsdale so thought airport Barrio was a blessing.  Had a bowl of posole and SMALL glass of wine for 26 (before tax and tip). Flight delayed so order the  \""large\"" 8 oz wine. Get the ck-$22.74. For ONE average size/quality glass of wine.  OUTRAGEOUS.

I don't get how a restaurant can serve burn crispy black bread. It would just be easier to just toast me up a new one. Sorry, I love my bread so to get bread that a two year old can toast up better really had to take off a star for that. \n\nOverall, it was just okay and wouldn't be back for a long time since there is so many better restaurant in Vegas for the price."

It takes a few times to get use to it. \n\nThe drive thru is horrible. We watched some fellow approach a customer in a car to take his order, there was no menu to see so the customer said he cant order yet because he needed a menu, the staff sarcastically said \"" really? you need a menu \"" \nAs we drove up he approached us and we just wanted some chili dogs. The drive up speaker was not functioning, they had these staff people walking from car to car taking orders, then another person radioed them in, another person took your money, then the finally staff person gave you the food. \nWe arrived at 2pm, it was 2:35 by the time we were one car behind the pay window, at this point we were so frustrated we left the line and headed somewhere else to eat. \n\nOh well"

Intention Review: I recently rented a car from Budget/Avis at LAS airport during a trip to Las Vegas. While I have had mostly positive experiences with this company in the past, this particular rental was just average. As a result, I am giving it an average rating of 3 stars. The rental price was a bit higher than I would have liked, but it was still cheaper than some other companies. Upon arriving at the counter, the representative was friendly and efficient until he began pushing the insurance option. I declined, but he made me feel like a criminal and emphasized the potential financial consequences of any damages. This made me uncomfortable and put a damper on the start of my trip. Additionally, there used to be a representative at the car who would inspect it with the customer, but now you have to go back to the booth to report any damages. The person working the booth was not very helpful and had poor customer service skills. However, the van itself was in decent condition and served its purpose of getting us to Disneyland. But next time, I will probably spend a little more money for better service. Overall, my experience was just average and I will be exploring other rental options in the future."

I recently stayed at this hotel and was initially impressed by the renovated room. It had a modern and tasteful decor, complete with plenty of power outlets and a HD TV. The housekeeping service was also satisfactory. However, my enthusiasm quickly faded when I realized the windows were so dirty that I could barely see out of them. It was a shame because the view outside seemed promising. 
The room rate was about $70 per night, which was reasonable for the location. However, I was a bit taken aback when I was told about the additional $20 per night hotel charge, which supposedly covered in-room wi-fi. This extra fee felt unnecessary and it would have been better to include it in the initial price. 
All in all, this hotel was decent but I must say I was underwhelmed. If I wanted a more luxurious stay, I would have chosen a different hotel. The lack of attention to detail, such as the dirty windows, made me question the overall cleanliness of the place. It's a shame because I really wanted to like this hotel, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend it to others."

Oh boy, where do I even begin with this tire saga? Let's just say, I'm livid. I've never felt so frustrated and disappointed with a company before. Three years ago, I purchased tires at this location with a promised 60,000 mile warranty. But now, with only 30,000 miles on the clock, the tread is completely gone. I go in to get them rotated and suddenly I'm told I need a new set. Say what now? Oh, apparently Yoko no longer offers a warranty in Arizona. Fantastic. And the alternative? They suggest I get Michelin tires because they're supposedly the best for my car. Great, just what I needed, another expense. But wait, there's more. I have a $250 credit because my tires didn't last the promised amount. At least that's what I was told. I had my doubts, so I went online to Discount Tire's website and found Continental tires at the same price, but with a much higher rating. Sold. I place my order, only to be told on delivery day that the tires are on backorder. Okay, fine. Another week of driving around on worn tires. Not a big deal, I'll survive. Fast forward to installation day and suddenly my $753 tires have magically turned into a $120 credit. Ummm, what? Where did my other $130 credit go? At this point, I'm beyond frustrated. But then I met my saviors, Justin and Paul. Turns out, whoever sold me the tires originally wrote down 40,000 miles instead of 60,000 for the warranty. And my credit? It was actually $200. Thank goodness for Justin and Paul coming to the rescue, otherwise I would have been stuck with a subpar set of tires that I could barely afford. So thank you, Justin and Paul, for turning my tire nightmare into a success story. But Discount Tire, you definitely need to work on your customer service and communication skills. Never again will I put myself through that kind of stress. You've lost a customer for life."
899,The lunch buffet is a little over priced for me... Both times I went the food items I wanted were either gone or nearly so and not replaced while I was there. As for the food there is much better fare to be had even buffet (and I hear the by the order rather than the buffet is better). Overall a slight disappointment.
900,"This is by far the worst meal my wife and I have ever had. From the start we were ignored, and a table of 6 were served there drinks and starters before us, and the staff had to be reminded twice. The starter was clearly not what we ordered and despite our complaint, the main meals were served quickly upon us. as for the main meals, my wife's pasta contained the most grissly fattiest ham you can imagine, making her pasta inedible. As far as my main meal was concerned, it was supposed to be Lasagne, but in fact turned out to be a congealed piece of meat and cheese which had just come out of a microwave, ohh and it was served cold. let's not forget the side salad which clearly the Manager seemed to. All in all a truly unpleasant experience, and in fact the Worst meal we have experienced. So much so that we refused to pay the full amount of the bill. the managers response was to lock us and all the other diners in the restauraunt for 1/2 hour awaiting Police arrival at the premises, Upon Police arriving the manager was rightly told that this was a civil matter and he was not allowed to lock us in the premises. A truly unpleasant experience!! If I could give minus stars I would. \"""
901,"Having frequented Pin Kaow a few times and enjoy the pad Thai I suggested this place for an early dinner. It was 5pm on a Saturday and there was only one other table (appox 5 people). The hostess came right up and greeted us and sat us at a booth. Then we waited... And waited... And waited. My boyfriend could see servers walking by yet no one came over. After sitting there for at least 10 minutes, we saw another couple walk in. The hostess immediately greeted them. Extremely frustrated, we walked out.  It is a shame, the food is good but the service was ridiculous!"

During my recent visit to this restaurant, I had a chance to experience both their food and atmosphere. Let's start with the food - while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't anything to write home about either. I've had better burritos in the past, ones that actually left a lasting impression on my tastebuds. Here, it just fell flat. However, the portion size was definitely something to note - talk about a lot of food for your money. And the extra side of garnish may have been a nice touch, but it couldn't make up for the lack of flavor in the entree.

Moving on to the atmosphere, I have to say I was impressed. With dim lighting and decor showcasing Santana's artwork, it definitely gave off a swanky vibe. And I have to give props to their live music on the weekends, although be warned that it can get pretty loud in there. But overall, I felt like I was in a cool and trendy spot.

As for service, I can't complain. Maria Maria always goes above and beyond to make sure her customers are happy. Whether it's recommending a dish or just checking in, she definitely knows how to show some love. Overall, while I may not be rushing back anytime soon, I wouldn't mind stopping by for a social mixer and some live music. "

It's a shame that my two most recent visits to this particular location have been such a letdown. The first time, I chalked it up to having a new, inexperienced stylist, but after my second visit turned out just as poorly, I couldn't ignore the pattern. Every time, my hair was cut in a way that was completely opposite of what I asked for. I don't know if they just don't listen or if they simply don't know how to cut hair properly. To make matters worse, when I reached out to a regional manager about my dissatisfaction, I was promised a coupon for a free cut at one of their other, supposedly better, salons. But, surprise surprise, I never received it.

My advice? If you're looking for a good, precise haircut, don't rely on this location. Save yourself the frustration and seek out a seasoned and skilled barber instead. Or, if you must go to a chain salon, do your research and find one with a strong training program and experienced staff. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did."
904,"My wife and I went to this show on 12/27/09.  When I bought the tickets, I did not know it was a preview show.  I just thought I was lucky to be able to buy tickets to this show so close to their grand opening.\n\nI am now starting to realize that Cirque shows are definitely departing from the style of shows like Mystere or O.  Instead, they are moving towards dances, themes, costumes, the set, and the occasional acrobatic stunts that take your breath away.  Viva Elvis is definitely trying to appeal to the Elvis fan.  The set was quite nice and the costumes were outstanding.  I learnt a few things about Elvis that I didn't know before.  Their rendition of his songs were good and bad.  It really depends on the singer.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't wowed by the show like I was in O, Mystere, and even Ka.  I guess I'm just not their target audience.  The choreography during the show wasn't that great either and a few of the dancers were definitely in the wrong place.  However, I chalk them up to just the lack of practice during a preview show.  Overall, 3 stars in my book."

I recently visited this sports bar to catch a game on Sunday, and I have mixed feelings about my experience. On one hand, the atmosphere was great - lively and perfect for game day. On the other hand, the service was extremely slow and lacking.

I noticed that the bartenders seemed to have their hands full with a handful of regulars who were occupying most of their attention. As a result, those of us who were not part of the ""inner circle"" had a hard time getting service. To make matters worse, the girl bartender, who seemed to have just rolled out of bed after a long New Year's Eve celebration, was sitting on the counter with her shoes on the same spot where they place the clean glasses - mouth down. I couldn't help but feel a bit disturbed by this lack of cleanliness.

Despite the service issues, I must admit that the bar itself had a great atmosphere. It's clear that this place is popular with locals and it's easy to see why. There are plenty of TVs to catch all the games, and the overall energy of the place was infectious.

However, based on my experience, I'm not sure if I would make the drive back out here again. It's a shame because I can see the potential for this to be a great spot for game day. Maybe if they were better staffed, the service would improve and make it worth the trip. For now, I'll have to give it a few more tries before deciding if it's worth the hassle."
906,Probably deserves more of a 3.5 rating. \n\nThe food was generally really good but because of my fabulous steak dinner at the palms the night before I wasn't as impressed as I should have been. The sushi was tasty but not the best I've had (especially at this price range). My favorite thing was the udon soup which was subtly flavorful but considering how many other things we ordered - this shouldn't be my favorite dish of the night.\n\nA beautiful restaurant but the service was a bit slow for us and despite having over 2 hours to dine there we ended up rushing our meal and skipping ordering further and jumping to the McDonalds to fill us up pre-Vegas drinking.

I was disappointed by my recent visit to Red Velvet. Despite hearing great things about this place, my experience was far from satisfactory. As a vegan, I was excited to try their special crispy vegan chicken sandwich. However, upon arrival, the sandwich practically fell apart in my hands. The lettuce tasted old and almost dirty, while the ""chicken"" itself was dry and unappetizing. But the biggest disappointment was the lack of knowledge from our waitress. When I asked about the ingredients, she had no idea what was in the sandwich or even the vegan mayo. As someone who likes to know what I'm eating, this was a major red flag. And to top it off, the service was incredibly slow despite our kind waitress. It's a shame that there aren't more vegan options in the area that actually serve fresh and quality food. I had high hopes for Red Velvet, but unfortunately, I won't be returning anytime soon."
908,"I really like the layout for this store.  The display the greets you as you walk through the doors is always pretty extravagant with various colors and new designs.  It's like a pile of x-mas presents laid out before you, except they're all open and with large price tags on them.  They definitely made this one more hip compared to locations that are well established.\n\nEverything in this store is spread out into small sections.  The accessories, luggage, and men's sections are all fairly small, and the selection on display is slim.  They do however carry a lot of models that aren't on display, you just have to know what you're looking for and ask.\n\nThe staff has been a hit or miss here.  The first few times it was pretty bad as they ignored me and kept looking at me as someone that couldn't afford any of the stuff in the store.  Then there was another time when Rita helped me out and she was super nice and I wound up making a purchase there (granted she was hot too and I kind of got suckered in, but it was worth it)."
909,"The room was very nice, but we arrived very late (early) because of a storm and waited 20 minutes in line to check in. It appeared they had 5 people on the desk at the time (on a Friday night...) then all weekend had to wait no less than 15 minutes for elevators that were almost all packed to capacity. We had a very difficult time getting to and from our room. The people we encountered in every elevator lobby area were extremely frustrated.\n\nAlso, we were approached by a lady (in the mall there) that asked if we would like to register for a free stay another time as some kind of promotion. I did not ask for the particulars. When I explained that we have a very busy travel year and Vegas was not in our plans again this year, she became very rude. Literally gave us a rude look and let us know that we had wasted her time. An interesting response to something we had only stopped for at her request. I want to say her name was Edith?\n\nEvery other employee in the hotel seemed very nice and breakfast in the Cafe was fantastic."
910,"Vasili'sTake Five recently opened up on Willy street right across from where I work.  I wanted to like this place because I love Greek Food, but the experience was really very average.\n\nThe service I received from my waitress was friendly and prompt.  She got us menus and water right away. \n\nThe decor is modern and clean.  I really liked the granite tables.\n\nMy dining companion and I ordered a sampler platter of appetizers.  While the cheese pie came out piping hot, I suspect it was premade/frozen and heated to order.  There was really nothing special about it.  Spanikopita or spinach pies were the same story.  The stuffed grape leaves were most certainly from a can.  They were really quite terrible.  I love stuffed grape leaves.  These were awful.  Seriously, I went to a restaurant so you could open a can and dump crap on a plate?\n\nEgg plant hummus was an interesting take on hummus, but they are definitely using canned garbanzo beans, and it didn't really wow me.  It was unusual and different, but not awesome tasting.  I'd rather have an amazing plain hummus than a wild/crazy hummus that is just OK.  \n\nStaff loudly yelling and chatting behind the bar in the other room detracted from the ambiance.  The music selection also seemed a little odd, and was way too loud for a dining room that was largely empty.  \n\nI ordered my salad \""light on the dressing\"".  Instead, they put the dressing on the side.  This is a major pet peeve of mine in restaurants.  I hate tossing the salad on the plate because it's difficult to do and makes a mess.  If I wanted dressing on the side, I would have asked for dressing on the side.  It also cost extra to have chicken on top  and then they gave me a miniscule portion of chicken.  It was probably 3 ounces of chicken.  The salad itself wasn't very generously proportioned and so I actually left hungry after dropping almost $20 on dinner.  \n\nA few weeks prior to this visit, I had a chicken pita to go, was good, but overpriced.  The moussaka that my friend had, which I tried a bite of, was very good tasting.  \n\nOverall, save your money and go somewhere else because this restaurant just isn't firing on all cylinders.  There are too many great restaurants in the Willy street neighborhood to waste your money here."

Ah, Starbucks. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? The warm, comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee, the satisfying kick of caffeine, the familiar green logo that instantly puts a smile on my face. However, my experience at this particular location inside the convention center was a bit underwhelming.

Let's start with the positives. The staff here are surprisingly pleasant and calm, despite the chaotic and never-ending lines. They definitely deserve some recognition for their unwavering hospitality. The limited menu is understandable, considering the constant influx of customers during trade shows. And although there is minimal seating inside, I appreciate the tables and chairs in the lobby for those moments when I need to escape the hustle and bustle and just enjoy my coffee in peace.

Now, on to the negatives. The most disappointing aspect was that they do not accept Starbucks cards. As a loyal customer, I always have my trusty card ready to earn points and rewards. But alas, that was not the case here. And let's not forget about the long lines. I understand it's a popular spot, especially in the mornings, but waiting in line for what feels like eternity can really drain the energy out of a person.

Overall, this Starbucks location is a decent option if you're in desperate need of a caffeine fix while at the convention center. But don't expect anything more than a basic menu and a cramped, busy atmosphere. Who knows, maybe they'll start accepting Starbucks cards in the future and that will make all the difference. For now, I'll stick to my usual go-to locations."

Walked in and was surprised this place was so busy but was excited since that usually means its good. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was greeted by 3 very friendly sushi chefs. This is the reason I keep coming back. The sushi chefs are always inviting and will help you with any questions you have!they are awesome! The sushi quality is pretty good as well!always super fresh tasting and so much variety!now for the reasons I give only 3 stars. the first time I dined there, I was charge $2.75 for soda WATER....that's just tap water with bubbles.never in my 12 years of being in the service industry have I ever Been charged or charged a Customer for tap water with some C02. When I asked the manager he had no explanation for me and said \""yeah it's just like that and there's a charged for it.\"" Now if I was the manager of a nice sushi Resturant I would respond with \""yes ma'm there is a charge for water with bubbles here but since it's your first time and you didn't know I would be happy to make an exception and remove it off your bill this time\"" whatever dude my bellys fool of delicious sushi. and I'm not in the mood to end my night poorly over some bubbles.....I'll just order regular tap next time....last thing is I've been to this place at least 4 times now and only last night was I asked if I had an AYCE stamp card....ummm no I don't because I was never asked in the first place....the servers need to communicate with eachother more and I think the manager needs some tips on hospitality....."

Well guess what they didn't get us the wrong Louie Burger they gave us a portobello burger and it is called a Portobello Burger on the menu.  Needless to say he also was given fries.  We clarified we needed a fried burger with egg and tots. Drumroll ... This time we get a different Louie Burger with onions and still no egg or bacon.  To top this off I had ordered the chicken tacos (which were awesome), however the rice and black beans were totally cold. We refused to pay for any of the burgers and I told them about the rice and beans but they only took off the burger. Our total out the door was $40 bucks and we aren't planning to return.

This is in a pretty diverse area of town! White's, Blacks, Hispanics and Asians alike! This may not matter to most people but when you go to a market you'd expect them to be open to the things you need. Also, the bathrooms are dirty and a cashier named Wanda was just plain crabby. I drove to another Safeway and got my hair pomade as normal. I won't be returning to this store."

While I had high hopes for this place after hearing about the change in ownership, my experience was far from impressive. The continental breakfast and mushroom spinach quiche sounded promising, but unfortunately, they fell short of expectations. The croissant in the continental breakfast was too doughy and the crepe omelet was forgettable. And don't get me started on the quiche - while it had decent flavor, the raw dough completely ruined it for me. To make matters worse, I was overcharged by 30 cents due to a discrepancy with my coupon and a sneaky charge for a glass of water that was only added after I received the total. Unacceptable. While the atmosphere of this place is undeniably charming, their service and food need some serious improvement before I consider giving them a second chance. Don't waste your time or money here - they clearly have some kinks to work out."

First off, let me just say that I had high hopes for this place. My son chose Buca for his birthday dinner and I was excited to try it out. Sadly, my experience fell short of my expectations.

Let's start with the price. I was shocked when the bill came out to be around $200 for a party of 7 with no alcohol. That seems pretty steep for a casual Italian restaurant. Maybe I'm just used to my local Italian joint that offers family-sized portions at a fraction of the cost.

Speaking of family-style, that seems to be the main appeal of this place. When we ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, we were presented with a giant bowl of pasta and only 2 or 3 meatballs the size of a softball. Not only were the meatballs underwhelming, but it was a bit awkward trying to divide them up among the group. Personally, I would prefer smaller, evenly sized meatballs to share.

On a more positive note, the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. It had a cozy Italian vibe that added to the dining experience, though it couldn't quite rival the authentic feel of a North End eatery in Boston.

Now, onto the biggest disappointment of the night: the smell. As we entered the restaurant, we were hit with a not-so-pleasant aroma coming from a dumpster that was placed prominently in the parking area, right next to the main entrance. And let me tell you, when the wind worked against us, we were all forced to endure the pungent smells of trash. Not exactly the appetizer we were hoping for.

Overall, my son enjoyed his birthday dinner and that's ultimately what matters. However, I can't say I'll be rushing back to Buca anytime soon. The high prices, lackluster food, and unfortunate placement of a dumpster all added up to a less-than-stellar experience. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, or maybe they have some areas for improvement. Either way, I think Buca could benefit from a few changes."

I visited this restaurant with a friend on a beautiful evening and it was such a great experience! I stumbled upon this gem on Yelp and was intrigued by the menu. I decided to try the Baked Artisan Goat Cheese Crepes for my main course and oh my gosh, it was amazing! The combination of spinach, herb grilled wild mushrooms, roasted bell pepper sauce, and watercress salad was a flavor explosion in my mouth. And let's not forget the special sauce, it really elevated the dish to a whole new level. 
But the real MVP of the night was the Bunny Slope drink. A perfect mix of Vodka, Strawberry Cream Infusion, and White Chocolate Liqueur. It was surprisingly strong but oh so delicious. I couldn't resist ordering another one. 
The service was top-notch, our server was attentive and friendly. It's hard to believe this place has only been open for a little over a year because everything seemed to run smoothly. My only suggestion would be to add some more decor to the walls as they felt a bit plain. But overall, I had a fantastic dining experience and I will definitely be back for dinner. And let's not forget about their happy hour, you can definitely count me in. "

My biggest disappointment with this place is their inconsistency. I thought I hit the jackpot when I found this comic book store near my neighborhood, but unfortunately, they never seem to open on time. One time, I was determined to finally buy a comic on a Sunday, only to find out they opened an hour late. I even thought they had gone out of business, but lo and behold, they answered the phone when I called. 

To make use of my wasted time, I decided to have a couple of beers at Casey Moore's while I waited. But really, it shouldn't be my responsibility to find ways to kill time just because this store can't stick to their own business hours. Plus, who knows what other plans I could have made if I knew they would be late? 

Although their selection of comics is pretty cool, the sloppy management and lack of punctuality is a major turn-off. I did manage to find two interesting comics, one being a comedic indie gem called The Fart Party (which, let's be real, is much more entertaining than a frat party). The second one, Dogs & Water, took me on a trippy and surreal journey that I can't even describe. But despite the cool finds, the overall experience was tainted by the frustration of constantly waiting for them to open. 

If you do decide to check this place out, be prepared to wait and have your plans potentially ruined. And if you're looking for recommendations, just ask the guy at the register, he'll steer you towards obscure comics that you've probably never heard of. But then again, maybe that's the only positive, since they can't seem to get the basics right. Overall, not recommended."
919,"My wife and I went here Tuesday night for dinner with a plan to come a bit early, sit at the bar, and enjoy some happy hour cocktails.  Our plan was thwarted when we realized this place was some sort of cougar gathering place.  The bar was packed with little hope of somebody getting up.  So, we just took a seat in the main dining area without a wait.\n\nAnyway, everything to say about this place has already been said on here.  I expected much more because of the location but it really was just an upscale Olive Garden that charges triple.\n\nThe Gorgonzola Lamb Chops appetizer was great and so was the Bistecca Insalata.  I should have just stopped there and let that be my dinner.  Instead, for an entree, I ordered the Garganelli Carbonara which was waaaay too creamy, oversauced and under-flavorful.  It was not advertised like that on the menu.  Almost everything else on the menu sounds good but I doubt the stuff tastes as good as it looks.  My wife had some sort of shrimp dish that looked excellent but was way to salty and no doubt contained frozen shrimp.\n\nThe service was very good but I probably won't be back.  I almost never have pasta so when I do splurge I want it to be delicious and the stuff here is just blah."
920,"Customer Service... what's that? This place has no clue. Rude, and outright mean. They had nothing nice to say about anything or anyone in the store. I would rather drive miles out of my way than ever set foot in this place again. If you must use UPS to ship something there are many other locations that will treat you like a customer, not an annoyance. \n\nIf it matters I was shipping a RMA Computer Hard Drive. The guy at the counter was rather upset that I had the nerve to ask for some tape to seal the box and attach the pre-paid label. His justification was that his store saw no profit from people using pre-paid labels that are bought online and printed out. The tape costs $3.00 a roll. That is a 200ft roll.. So the 8\"" that I needed set him back about $.13. His attitude forever lost him a customer. I ship things such as this 4-9 times a year. Never will another item be sent from this location."

My experience at this veterinary clinic was quite disappointing. I brought my puppy in because she was losing hair in spots, and after multiple visits and hundreds of dollars spent on medication, the problem was not improving. In a moment of frustration, I even questioned if they had misdiagnosed my puppy with ringworm when it seemed like she may actually have mange. Unfortunately, they assured me it was ringworm and continued to prescribe expensive medication. However, after seeking a second opinion from a doggie dermatologist, I found out that my puppy did not have ringworm at all. It was actually dermodex, a condition that is common in puppies and should have been one of the first things they looked for. I was able to get a proper diagnosis and treatment in just 10 minutes at the dermatologist's office, and it cost me significantly less than what I had spent at Banfield. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this clinic and I strongly advise others to seek out a different vet. The financial and emotional toll of this experience has been exhausting and I would hate for anyone else to go through the same ordeal."
922,"Well.....what to say ....\n\nWe got a deal on Itison for two hotdogs and a half pint of Innis and Gunn or a glass for wine for \u00a39. Good deal! \nSmaller than I thought, we had reserved a table and when I arrived people were already sitting there, which was no problem as i was early. My partner arrived and we sat at another table until ours became free, we would have just sat at the other table for the duration but the door was opening continually and a very cold breeze would catch you and so we waitied on the table further away from the door. Id imagine that this pub isnt all that warm most of the time and I am a total girl and need heat in this weather. We ordered two chilli dogs and they arrived with fries in a wooden box, nice touch, The cocktails here are only \u00a36.95...so yes i ordered a Margarita! was pretty poor to be honest! The hotdog meal was okay and I dont think i would have paid full price for the meal. Beer selection was okay but i have been in pubs with a much better selection. \nI go the impression that Jeremiah is trying to be the next Hanging Bat, but just not at good as!"
923,"They hire nothing but unskilled assholes at this location. One time I came in to buy a Gatorade and a news magazine, from the moment I came in they were rude, they were following me everywhere I went in the store as if I was going to steal something, and when I was looking for the gatorades I accidentally stumbled upon the alcohol section and got yelled at by one of the employees that I'm not old enough to be there and I shouldn't be anywhere near there even though I didn't even go into the alcohol section and I was just looking for the gatorades. On top of that, when I went to pay for the magazine and Gatorade, while they had an employee stalking my every move to see that I didn't steal anything, the cashier was extremely rude to me talking to me with an angry voice and even overcharging me for the Gatorade leading me to only getting the magazine instead. Overall, all the employees were rude to me and all of them were profiling me from the start. And then another time I went in, months later, I went in to pay for something and I was wearing my \""register to vote with me\"" button because I had been doing voter registration earlier, and the cashier was extremely rude not wanting to attend me and even telling me that she doesn't vote and she thinks voting is dumb and whoever votes is dumb like me. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST AT THIS LOCATION, DO NOT GO THERE."
924,we saw this place while shopping next door at the Indian market.  I was excited to see a Mexican restaurant that was going to be differant.

Every thing was good but nothing was speacial or different from any other mexican place.

I have been to this buffet in the past and decided to give it another chance during my visit to Vegas. Unfortunately, I experienced the same issue as before - the food was cold. Despite the tantalizing aroma and variety of dishes, I couldn't help but feel disappointed when I took my first bite and was met with a chilled sensation. It's a shame because the staff were friendly and the atmosphere was enjoyable. But when it comes down to it, the most important aspect of a buffet is the food, and in this case, it just didn't meet my expectations. I couldn't help but wonder if quantity was prioritized over quality, as the dishes lacked flavor and depth. On the bright side, the dilis was piled high and seemed appealing, but unfortunately, it tasted stale and cold. I hope that the owners take notice of this issue and make adjustments, as I would love to revisit in the future and have a more satisfying experience."
926,"RED LOBSTERS NEW CLAIM TO FAME IS THEY HAVE FISH EXPERTS ON HAND TO FIX YOUR FOOD. LMAO REALLY BECAUSE THEY SO CALLED EXPERT CANT FRY FISH AS COMMON AS CAT....THAT'S CATFISH \nThe staff are nice and they are updating their look. But they need to hire better cooks. I think they may have a pastry chef cooking fish. Because that's just what I ordered. Lord why me? That's all I was busy thinking all that night. The fish was taken back 4 times. Couples ate and left and they still brung me half done catfish. So, they cooked it 4 times and its still not done. It's catfish my god daughter who is 8 can fry catfish.\nEverything was perfect but the catfish. It makes me ponder how many chefs does it take to cook catfish at Red Lobster? It's fried catfish people. UGH! Anyway I will return and give them another chance to please me. However I will order chicken or some other dish. Red Lobster has made me a little angry because I cut the fish into 3 and they just kept re-frying the same 3 fish its like hello can someone get a clue and send new catfish to the table. So the manager took it off my ticket. On the way out I took a picture of the Lobsters inside the tank and went home. Yes they told me they was sorry a million times. I am to I'm sorry I had to look at uneatable fish and could not have a nice dinner with my husband."

I had heard great things about this place and was excited to finally try it out. The atmosphere was lively and vibrant, perfect for families with young kids. My little ones were especially enamored with the carousel out front - a definite plus! 

The food, however, was just okay. While the ingredients were clearly of high quality and the spice level was just right, it was a bit too pricey for what we got. I was also disappointed by the lack of budget-friendly meal deals. However, I must say, the variety of sides was impressive and the waffles were to die for. And let's not forget about that warm, syrupy goodness - a must-have when eating waffles! 

To be fair, the menu is quite expansive and I can't imagine anyone not finding something that piques their interest. So kudos for that! But, I have to mention that at times, the service seemed a bit disengaged. It didn't negatively impact our experience, but it was definitely noticeable.

Overall, I would recommend this place as a fun outing for families, but perhaps not as a go-to spot for some delicious fried chicken. It's a solid choice, but not quite at the level I was hoping for. Maybe I'll give it another try in the future and see if my opinion changes. "

I used to love this place, but my recent experience has left me extremely disappointed. After dining here for the first time in months, I can confidently say that the quality has significantly decreased. The pasties, which used to be a favorite of mine, were lackluster and unappetizing. But that's not even the biggest issue. I was shocked to see that my bill was significantly higher than usual. After some investigation, I realized that I was being charged for items that were not even delivered to my table. When I brought this up to the staff, they seemed completely uninterested in resolving the issue. They even had the audacity to tell me that these things take time to sort out. But upon further review of their communication with the trucking company, I discovered that they had actually encouraged the overcharging. It's unacceptable and bordering on dishonest. I have yet to receive a response from their team or any kind of resolution. Not to mention, their phone lines always seem to be unreachable. It's clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for Globaltranz. I'm incredibly disappointed and would rather pay ten times the price elsewhere than support a company with such poor business practices. Save yourself the headache and spend your money somewhere else."

Dear Giada,

My friends and I were so excited to dine at your new restaurant in Vegas. The atmosphere was lovely and we were treated warmly by the staff, especially our server Valentino and his assistant Joe. We enjoyed the interactive menu at the bar and loved our drinks, including the Destroyer and the Prosecco and St. Germain cocktail. The appetizers were amazing, especially the Bacon Wrapped Dates and the Vitello Tonnato. However, our overall experience was not as great as we had hoped.

While the food was delicious, we couldn't help but feel disappointed by the portion sizes and prices. My friend ordered the ravioli and while it was filled with sweet lobster, the serving size was small for the price. As for my Colorado rack of lamb, it was perfectly cooked but the portion was on the smaller side. We also tried the asparagus as a side, which was grilled perfectly but again, the serving size did not match the price.

We were also a bit confused by the noise from the street that could be heard even with the windows opened. However, the biggest issue for us was the lack of options for dietary restrictions. My friend has a gluten allergy and when she asked about options, she was met with a limited selection and a dismissive attitude from our server. We also noticed that the online menu does not accurately reflect the options available at the restaurant.

Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks were delicious and we were ecstatic to meet you in person. However, for the amount we paid, we expected a more satisfying dining experience. Maybe consider updating the menu and providing more options for those with dietary restrictions. Overall, while we may not be returning anytime soon, we wish you all the best with your future endeavors.

Sincerely, A disappointed customer."

I was excited to try this Hawaiian BBQ place after hearing rave reviews from friends and seeing the constant flow of customers. However, my experience fell short of expectations. The chicken combo we ordered was decent, with the BBQ being flavorful and tender. The crispy chicken, on the other hand, was the standout dish with its perfect crunch and taste. But what really brought my rating down was the service. We visited on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed, with only a few tables available. It seemed like they were understaffed and we had to wait a while to order and get our food. It was a bit disappointing to see the owner or manager not actively helping out with the busy rush. Overall, the food was good but the service left much to be desired."

Upon entering this fun and lively establishment, we couldn't help but be drawn in by the walls covered in colorful murals and the constant buzz of conversation. The aroma of freshly baked pizzas only added to our excitement. We quickly snagged a table and eagerly perused the menu, knowing we were in for a treat.

As we sipped on our own wine (BYOW for the win!), we couldn't help but notice the efficient yet slightly rushed service. The all-male staff seemed to be in a constant hurry, barely pausing to take our order. And to our surprise, our mains were brought out in the middle of our appetizers, followed by the check halfway through the meal. Talk about being efficient, but it left us feeling a bit frazzled and wishing for a more relaxed dining experience.

That being said, the food was definitely a standout. The pizzas were delicious and we could tell they were crafted with care. And at only $30 per person, it's definitely not breaking the bank. However, it would have been nice to have a bit more of a personal touch from the staff. Maybe a smile or a friendly comment would have made a big difference.

But hey, we're not complaining too much. It was a rainy Saturday morning and the place was practically empty, giving us plenty of room to enjoy our pizzas and take in the vibrant atmosphere. We could only imagine how lively and energetic this place must get on a busy night. So, if you're in the mood for a laid-back, casual dining experience with great food and an unbeatable atmosphere, this is definitely the spot for you. Embrace the concept and embrace the fun!"
933,"A very mixed bag.  The prices are inflated for merchandise that frequently seems to be \""seconds\"".  There are some great buys, but that's only for items on \""sale\"", and by using one of their 20/40/50% coupons.  Cute home accessories, but again, prices are cheaper for similar stuff at other stores. Big selection of shoes...but way overpriced. Lingerie & costume jewelry selections are plentiful & pricing is good. Salespeople, when they can be found (almost never), are abrupt, bordering on rude (especially the ones who've worked there awhile!).  Cashiers also are not the warmest folks..and seem  unwilling to help."

I used to frequent this tanning salon regularly, unaware of the better deals offered at other places. I was a loyal customer for two years, paying a whopping $60 a month for their Level 3 membership (Gold). However, I recently discovered that other places like BB and OneStop offer the same membership level for almost half the price. While they do have a great selection of lotions, their computers were always down and I often found myself being overcharged. It's a hassle and not worth the money. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else."

We were excited to try this restaurant, especially because our server Amy came highly recommended. The interior of the restaurant was gorgeous, and the ambiance was perfect for a night out with friends. We tried the lamb chops, escargot, and foie gras, and while they were all tasty, the foie gras definitely stood out. We can see why it's their signature dish.

But let's talk about the service. Amy was fantastic. She was knowledgeable about the menu and helped us navigate through the different options. Her recommendations were spot on and she even entertained us with funny stories and jokes throughout the night. She made us feel like we were having dinner at a friend's house. However, the rest of the service fell short. Our drinks were forgotten and we had to wait quite a while for refills. And to top it off, when we received our bill, we noticed we were charged for a table that wasn't ours.

Overall, the food was delicious, but the service was inconsistent. While Amy was a gem, the rest of the staff seemed preoccupied and lacked the same level of attentiveness. We had a great time thanks to Amy, but it's uncertain if the service alone is enough to bring us back for another visit. We give it a solid B, maybe a C+."

Despite the negative experiences we had with the management and staff at this apartment complex, I have to admit that the amenities and grounds were quite impressive. The landscaping was well-maintained and the pools were clean and inviting. However, the same cannot be said for the office staff. Justine, the person who helped us with our apartment, seemed completely clueless about the industry and made a major mistake by giving us a handicap apartment without our knowledge. We had to stay in another temporary unit until our actual one was ready. To make matters worse, the ""maintenance guy"" Tony was caught buying drugs from other residents. It's disappointing to see such behavior from people who represent the complex. Despite its potential, I would not recommend living here due to the unprofessionalism and mismanagement of some of the staff. It's a shame because we had to break our yearlong lease and leave because of issues with our service dog, even though we had all the necessary documentation. Hopefully, the company can address these issues and improve the overall experience for future residents."

The host was busy talking on his mobile which took a few minutes.  No biggie, it must have been important.  He apologized and sat us at a booth.\n\nAMBIENCE\nDark, a tad loud with the casino's music, rock star'ish, and a lot of decorative faux cowhide items.

They were actually pretty good.  \n\nFor appetizers, the bf ordered the seafood platter which included a king crab leg, oysters, lobster tail, and some shrimp; I ordered the mini mini 3 which includes three half-dollar sized grilled cheese bites, a tea mug of tomato, and another mug of corn chowder.  Since I'm the only azn in the world who doesn't eat seafood I cannot rate his dish.  My dish was aok.\n\nFor entrees, the bf orders scallops over lobster mashed potatoes (or taters as he calls 'em).  He notes the scallops were cooked perfectly and were divine.  I ordered the usual, a 6oz. filet mignon, medium well.  The steak was tender and seasoned well but, perhaps not the best cut of filet--it looked like one of the end pieces.  When it first came out, I almost thought they brought out a sirloin.  As soon as I cut into it and tasted it, I realized it was indeed filet.\n\nThe bf and I noticed that none of the tables had salt and pepper shakers.  Luckily, we didn't need them because everything we ordered was seasoned well.\n\nAnd of course dessert.  We ordered the creme brulee which comes in a trio of caramel, chocolate, and (traditional) vanilla.  The caramel and chocolate almost seemed like puddings with a caramelized sugar crust.  The vanilla was a traditional custard.  Don't get me wrong the dessert trio was still delicious.  Like I mentioned above, the server forgot to bring out the bf's cappuccino :(.  \n\nCONCLUSION\nIt was a good meal but not worth the prices. I would say the steak quality was that of Outback Steakhouse's (the one at Casino Royale), however the bf thought the seafood was tasty and too small of portions.  Our grand total was $122.  Luckily, we had a $65 comp.  I can't see us returning unless we were given another comp.  I'd rather go to Veloce Cibo at the M Resort for the same price."

Intention Review: I was drawn in by the charming decor and promises of delicious cocktails and appetizers during happy hour. But the experience at Clever Koi quickly went downhill. While the cocktails were well-crafted and the edamame fritters were tasty, our main courses were a disappointment. My husband's Mongolian beef was overcooked and lacked flavor. My summer corn ramen was mediocre at best, and I had to rely on extra sriracha to give it some much-needed kick. And to top it off, the service was slow and unattentive. We were never offered refills on our drinks and had to flag down our server multiple times to get the check. Overall, not worth the hype and definitely not worth the price.

I have been a loyal customer at this Thai restaurant for years now and have had many great experiences, but my most recent visit was a bit lackluster. The location and decor are still top-notch, but the lighting was just not up to par. I couldn't fully enjoy my meal because of the harsh fluorescent lights that made the atmosphere feel more like an office than a cozy restaurant.

But let's get to the food. The Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, and Pineapple Fried Rice were just as delicious as I remembered. However, the Pad Prik King and Spicy Eggplant fell short this time around. They lacked the bold flavors that I was used to and were a bit lackluster. I also decided to try a ""new"" dish, which was recommended to me by a friend, and unfortunately, it did disappoint.

Additionally, when I asked for a cocktail to pair with my meal, I was disappointed to find out that the liquor license was still pending. It's a shame because this place truly deserves to have a full bar with its amazing food.

Even though this visit was not as great as previous ones, I still have faith in this restaurant. I hope they continue to improve and expand their menu. This town desperately needs a unique and high-quality dining option, and Archi's could easily fill that void. Let's just hope they can live up to their potential and not go down the same road as all the other generic pizza and Asian joints in town. Keep up the good work, Archi's!"

I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked). \n\nFelt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place. Will not go back."

I recently visited Home of Gourmet with a friend for dinner. We were excited to try out this Chinese restaurant, as we had heard good things about it from our fellow Yelp reviewers. The first thing we noticed was the fact that the restaurant had recently changed ownership, and according to the owner, they had completely revamped the kitchen. This definitely piqued our interest and raised our expectations for the food.

The lunch and dinner serving styles were different, with the former being served cafeteria style and the latter offering a huge variety of over 100 dishes. We opted for the dinner menu and were not disappointed. The portions were huge and we were impressed by the reasonable prices. In fact, we were able to share some dishes between the two of us, making it a great deal for the amount and quality of food we received.

Among the vast selection of dishes, we tried the chili oil fish and the Ma Po Tofu, both of which were delicious and had a good level of spiciness. The stir-fried green beans were also a standout, and we were pleased to find that the employees were willing to customize our dishes to our preferred tastes.

However, the downside of this restaurant was its small size. We visited during peak hours and the restaurant was packed, making it a bit inconvenient to navigate and find a seat. The parking situation also added to the hassle. But overall, our dining experience at Home of Gourmet was enjoyable and the food definitely stood out. We will definitely be back, but perhaps at a less busy time. So, if you're looking for some authentic Chinese food with generous portion sizes, give this place a try. Just be prepared for a potential wait during peak hours. "

The first time I went to Nine 05, I was blown away by the flavors and unique menu options. The pork belly crepes were a game changer for me - I never thought I'd enjoy crepes with meat inside, but these were so delicious I can't stop thinking about them. And the mussels in red sauce? Let's just say I had to resist licking the bowl clean. 

But on my second visit, I was a little underwhelmed. The atmosphere was still great and the service was top notch, but the food just wasn't as impressive as I remembered. Perhaps it was because I ordered the same dishes again (I'm not a big risk taker), but they didn't quite have that same wow factor. 

Also, just a heads up - the parking lot is super dark and there were some shady characters hanging around outside. As a big guy, I wasn't too bothered, but I would be hesitant to recommend this place to single ladies. 

Overall, Nine 05 has some amazing dishes and great service, but I can't give it a higher rating because of the inconsistency I experienced on my second visit and the potential safety concerns. Still worth trying, but maybe mix it up and try some different menu items."

After hearing great things about Serendipity 3, my family and I decided to give it a try. We've been there for every meal of the day and have never been disappointed. However, our recent experience was not as amazing as we had hoped."

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this hospital recently, and let me tell you, it was far from pleasant. From the moment I walked in, it was obvious that the employees here were not happy to be here. I overheard one triage nurse speaking to a patient in a rude and uncaring manner, which was quite shocking given their profession. The lack of empathy and compassion was truly concerning.

I later found out that this hospital is known as a training hospital. While some of the nurses we encountered were kind and helpful, they were definitely in the minority. In fact, one nurse seemed to be counting down the days until they could leave. It made me question why they even chose to work in the healthcare field if they didn't have a genuine desire to help others.

But the real disappointment came when we were admitted. Not only did we never see a doctor, but we were also forced to fill out an APA form before we could even leave. Talk about adding insult to injury. And as if our experience wasn't bad enough, we were hit with outrageous bills a week later. I couldn't believe it. I seriously thought we had been admitted to a prestigious hospital like Johns Hopkins, not this mediocre excuse for a healthcare facility.

In all honesty, unless you have no other option, I would highly recommend going somewhere else. The level of care and treatment we received left much to be desired, and the bills were just the cherry on top of a terrible experience. Save yourself the trouble and seek medical attention elsewhere."
955,"I'll be honest, it wasn't the best place I've ever been! I found the decor inside and out a bit garish, the food a bit bland and the staff a bit miserable, the highlight of my experience was the huge fish in the fish tank! \nI don't think I'll be returning any time soon, Sorry for the negative comment but it was a big disappointment for me."

I was in a bit of a panic when I noticed a strange noise coming from my brake pedal while driving in the Vegas heat. After some searching, I stumbled upon Professional Brake Service and was relieved to find out they were actually honest and trustworthy. Mary, the manager, was incredibly welcoming and remembered my name from our phone call earlier. She apologized that they couldn't find anything wrong with my brakes and even explained that some cars act up in extreme heat like we've been having. It was such a relief to not be pressured into unnecessary repairs or replacements.

But the best part? Not only did they not charge me for any unnecessary services, they also fixed a mistake from my previous brake shop and even reset my check engine light. Talk about going above and beyond! I couldn't be happier with their level of service and honesty. It's rare to find a mechanic that doesn't try to take advantage of customers, so when you do, you hold onto them tightly. I highly recommend giving Professional Brake Service your business - they truly care about their customers and their safety on the road."
957,"Came to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner using our buffet of buffets pass. Sadly it was not very good. There is a large variety of food types, but unfortunately most aren't worth trying. The Mexican station was the best, but even that wasn't great it was just far better than everything else! \n\nOn a positive note the line moved very fast and we waited for less than 10 minutes.\n\nIf you have the buffet of buffet pass save yourself the stomach space and go to the Paris buffet instead."

The Spotted Donkey Cantina is a hit or miss when it comes to their food. I've been here three times and their chips and salsa are always on point. The beans dip is also a must-try. However, when they get busy, they tend to skimp on the protein in their dishes or even undercook them. I've had the same issue with the red salsa, even after specifically asking for no salsa, it still ended up on my plate. On the bright side, the service is friendly and efficient, and they have a great selection of music playing (not too loud, don't worry). The atmosphere is welcoming with nice lighting, and they even have outdoor seating if you prefer. Overall, it's a decent spot to grab a bite, but don't be surprised if it's not always a hit. Give it a try and see for yourself!"

Park Road Park is a bustling hub of outdoor activity, perfect for those looking for a place to enjoy some sports, take their dog for a walk, or spend a leisurely afternoon with the family. With well-maintained fields and plenty of space to roam, it's a popular spot for sports leagues and Sunday afternoon picnics. The duck pond adds a charming touch to the park, complete with a 2/3 mile trail around it for those looking for a scenic stroll. Despite its popularity, the park manages to maintain a semi-rustic feel with its winding trails and natural surroundings. However, while the park itself is enjoyable, the overall experience can be a bit lacking. The amenities are limited, and the cleanliness of the park can be hit or miss. It's a shame that such a promising location falls short in terms of maintenance and upkeep. Despite its potential, Park Road Park just doesn't quite live up to expectations."

Another waiter waited to enter his order and finally walked away.  Our waiter had no people skills, no knowledge, and moved at a turtle's pace.  No condiments on sliders, no garnish and I was not even offered any.  The restaurant was so cold that I put a napkin over my fries to try and keep them warm......didn't work.  Horrid experience!"

If you're a fan of Above & Beyond, let me save you the trouble and advise you to skip this club. My girlfriends and I were excited to see the EDM duo spin at a new venue on 2/19/11, but our excitement quickly turned to disappointment. Despite having front of the line privileges and no cover charge (thank goodness), the entire experience was a complete letdown. The layout of the club was awful, leaving no room to dance and causing a huge cluster-f**k. As if that wasn't bad enough, it was packed to full capacity (or over), making it impossible to maneuver anywhere without being pushed or jostled by strangers. And let's not forget the abundance of individuals rolling on E, making the whole atmosphere uncomfortable and chaotic. The lack of organization was unacceptable, and I highly recommend avoiding this club unless you enjoy being in a cramped and uncomfortable space. Save your money and find a better venue to see your favorite DJs. "

Intention Review:I was so excited to stay at this hotel after hearing all the hype about it for years. But my experience was a complete letdown and far from luxurious. As soon as we walked into our ""upgraded"" corner suite, I was hit with a musty smell and noticed mold and mildew in the bathroom. The room felt run down and definitely not worth the high price we paid. 
But what truly ruined our stay was the horrendous service from the new management. The manager was blatantly racist and would even curse at the guests. It was uncomfortable and unprofessional. And don't even get me started on the roaches we found in the room. 
To make matters worse, the location was terrible. The area was unsafe, with the police constantly being called to the building. We had to walk to the store and even then, it was dangerous. I couldn't believe it when I saw two dead bodies on the block in just one month. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place at all costs. And if for some reason you do decide to stay here, be prepared to pay a hefty fee of $1500 just to break the lease. Trust me, it's not worth the problems. "
964,"Wando's is...alright.  There is usually at least some people there, even on a weeknight, which is good if you happen to have the luxury of making it out on a monday or sunday night.  The drinks aren't spectacular-I don't think the fishbowl is all that spectacular.  The bar itself is pretty nicely laid out-it is three levels with a little bit of a different atmosphere on each level.\n\nThe reason why I've never been a big fan of Wando's is the crowd.  The people are extremely uninteresting.  You have your typical 24 year old dudes going out with a group of guys, thinking they are the coolest thing to ever happen to this city/bar, trying to get as hammered as possible-and you've got your 20 year old sorority/sorority-type girls who can't seem to help but falling in love with their every words as well.  You also have the madison grads who come back to relive the days of their youth - who really haven't found anything better to do since.  If I could meet cooler people at this bar, I would definitely like it alot more.  As it is-if you are a madison student, you need to come here when you turn 21 to get the fabled \""fishbowl,\"" but after that there are plenty of other better choices in Madison if you want a fun night."
965,"awful.  even for a stranded, hungry airport captive.\n\nordered the steak thai wrap.  3 bites into it, had to toss it. Still, stayed with me for 4 very uncomfortable hours.

966,"Okay so not to be critical but they make salads. Are they really good salads? I would say they are good. Mind blowing not sure about that, \n\nA couple things I liked. If you add a meat of some kind they grill it up fresh and that is great. I got salmon one day and it was very tasty. The ingredients are fresh as well and hey since it's a salad that's pretty important.\n\nWhere they fall short is the lettuce is not chopped up enough and so you are stuck trying to cut up these giant lettuce leaves with a flimsy plastic knife and fork. Not site where their lettuce comes from but it's like something out of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. Serious salad monsters. \n\nSecond the people making the salads are what I can only describe as intense. I realize they are busy and in a hurry but as the joker would ask - why so glum? It just isn't a good vibe. I mean sorry your store is way too small for the hordes of people that try to jam in there but not really my issue.\n\nThat brings us to number three. The place is small. Too small for the crowds they get. Hopefully they are going to move into the old Quiznos location a couple doors down. I mean seriously they almost need crowd control. If you like cozy well you'll really like it. No place to sit it is to go only.\n\nSo would I go there again. After three visits I'm going to have to say no. Line is too long, the person on the grill is always behind, and well I want my lunch from people who can take 5 seconds to smile and be thankful that I'm supporting their business.\n\nSo summary. Salads are good as long as you are okay with a few quirks. I'll wave at you when you're in line while I head down to metropolitan or Valhalla. \n\nEnjoy."

My friends and I finally got a chance to try this highly recommended restaurant on a quiet weeknight. We were promptly seated since the place was pretty empty. The menu had some enticing specials, but we opted for the usual dishes.

To start off, we ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops as an appetizer. While it was good, we were disappointed to see only four pieces on the plate. Moving on to the main course, I tried the grilled Reuben sandwich, which was bursting with flavor, while my friends had the cheddar chicken which was just okay.

Overall, the food was just mediocre and not worth the steep price we paid. Looking back, I wish I had taken the advice of others and tried their famous steak. Maybe then, I would have had a different opinion. But for now, I don't think the food here is worth a second visit.

The service was also nothing to write home about. Our waitress seemed a bit out of it and not very attentive. On the bright side, the restaurant had a lovely ambiance with its high ceilings and cozy setting, perfect for intimate dinners with friends.

I've heard great things about this place, but unfortunately, our experience didn't quite match up. While I may give their steak a chance in the future, I don't think I would recommend this restaurant to anyone else."

Our experience at The Palazzo was definitely not what we expected. Despite requesting a non-smoking room, we were given a room that reeked of cigarettes. The staff's excuse was that it was a holiday weekend and they were fully booked, but we found it hard to believe that a major resort would not have any extra rooms available. Instead, they offered us an air filter which took over 2 hours to arrive and did little to improve the situation.

In addition to the unpleasant smell, our room was not thoroughly cleaned before our arrival. Toiletries were missing and small things like the bag for the ice bucket were not replaced. These may seem like minor details, but for the price we paid, we expected better attention to cleanliness and detail.

The only compensation we received was the waiving of our resort fees, which didn't really make up for the inconvenience and disappointment of our stay. Overall, The Palazzo fell short of our expectations and we were disappointed with the lack of effort from the staff to make things right."
970,"I am reading through these reviews and wonder if we went to a different Lidia's Pittsburgh, because on our romantic Valentine's Day the Olive Garden would have been more fresh and authentic (p.s. it's neither of those things). My husband and I loved her cooking show and figured that her restaurant would be something we would like to try, boy were we way off. Maybe it was our fault for choosing a holiday but it was their fault for cutting corners, in the worst way possible, FLASH FROZEN FOODS!  They had a fixed menu with some options, but we already knew we were going to be charged $48 per person, which was pretty pricey, but maybe it was worth it, well it wasn't. First course was a fried ball that apparently had lobster in it, all you could taste is how much work the fryer had put in for the day, and it was a lot. Second course, couldn't wait, Caesar salad and a dish with shrimp and spaghetti squash,  salad was ok, the shrimp you couldn't taste because they were the little frozen ones that are cute when breaded but when they aren't they just look sad, as if they had never been in the sea (which I am banking these hadn't).  Then finally main entr\u00e9e, we held out hope thinking we there could still be a chance, again the price was $48 PER PERSON! My husband had gotten the tuna, JOKE, this made me maddest of all, it was pescado without the pescado part. We could have dealt with a small piece of FRESH tuna, but seeing as how this was an average piece of flash frozen crap with the grill marks already on it, thank goodness those poor chefs didn't have to actually grill a piece of fish. My pasta trio dish was ok, nothing about it screamed high and or fresh quality foods.  The worst part was that the service was excellent other than he could see on our faces we wanted nothing to do with the food, so he never asked how it was, but he was fantastic. So after the frozen crappy desert or finger food, that was horrid, we got our bill all said and done with a glass of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip, we paid $150.00! So save your money and go to spaghetti warehouse at least you know what you're getting.  Lidia, YOU OWE US MONEY!"

Lunch at this Mexican restaurant was a disappointing experience. In a city known for its delicious Mexican food, this place fell short. The fact that there were more Mexicans working in the restaurant than Vietnamese staff was surprising. However, the service was lackluster and we had to ask multiple times for our drinks to accompany our meal. The soup we ordered was mediocre, but I understand that finding good pho isn't always easy. Unfortunately, our drinks didn't arrive until after we had finished our soup, but at least they were smart enough to put them in to-go cups. The only saving grace was the 10% discount we received for showing our CA licenses. Overall, there are plenty of other Mexican food options in town that offer better quality and value.

Overall, my experience at this restaurant was quite disappointing. Despite hearing positive things about it, I couldn't help but feel that I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.

I did enjoy the champagne and I have to give props to our server who kept them coming without hesitation. However, everything else was a let down. The smoked salmon was dry and the prime rib was overcooked. And to top it off, I couldn't even find a decent dessert option besides the chocolate covered strawberries. Don't even get me started on the strange inclusion of cotton candy as a dessert option.

My boyfriend and I decided to try out Evo after our original dinner plans fell through. I had never been there before, but my boyfriend was confident in his food choices (although based on his previous restaurant reviews, I was a little skeptical). Walking into Evo, I immediately loved the laid-back atmosphere and the diverse crowd. We sat at the corner of the bar and I was excited to try out their beer selection, only to find out they were completely out of my go-to choice - Coors. I guess I have to give them credit for taking pride in their beer selection, but it was still a bit disappointing. I ended up trying a peach beer, but they were also out of that. Jessie, our bartender, apologized and I started to feel a little left out while she and my boyfriend bonded over their love for weird beers. But then, Jessie went above and beyond and brought me a delightful beer that I would have never thought to try. Suddenly, my disappointment turned into excitement as I took a sip and instantly loved it.

As we waited for our food, Jessie continued to impress us with her recommendations and charming personality. By the time our food arrived, my boyfriend had already declared Jessie as his new best friend and I was happily munching on some delicious bread with infused oil. And let me tell you, the food did not disappoint. The pork belly was pure indulgence and the bacon syrup was the cherry on top. I couldn't help but feel like I was the third wheel to Jessie and my boyfriend's newfound bromance, but I didn't mind because the food and drinks were that good.

Overall, I have to say that Evo exceeded my expectations. The service was top-notch, the atmosphere was lively, and the food and drinks were phenomenal. I can only imagine how fun it must be on the weekends. My only complaint is that they were out of some of their popular menu items, but I guess that just speaks to their popularity. Lesson learned, if you want a fun night out with great food and drinks, Evo is the place to be. Just try to avoid going on Mondays, unless you're okay with being the third wheel to someone else's budding friendship."
981,"At one point in my life I played in a band, a full time traveling band. We've stayed in some of the shadiest places in town, and this would qualify. Let's put it this way, I slept with clothes on because I didn't want to touch the sheets. So, why did I stay here? Because it was a business trip, and I really had no choice. \n\nOn the plus side, it's within walking distance (2 minutes) of the EXPO center."
982,"

I had high hopes for this place based on the quick check-in process, but those hopes were quickly dashed when I walked into my room. The sheets and towels were dirty when I arrived! Who wants to sleep in someone else's filth?! And to make matters worse, the sheets they replaced it with had HOLES IN THEM! I've never seen such poor quality in a hotel before.

Despite this major disappointment, there were a few things I did like about the room. The temperature control worked well, the bathroom counter was pretty, and the shower had decent water pressure. But those positives were overshadowed by the overwhelming smell of toxic air freshener in the halls and bedroom, as well as the bathroom that smelled like a match had just been lit.

I also appreciated the option of a wired connection since my computer couldn't hold the wireless signal. But really, who doesn't have decent wifi in this day and age? And speaking of being behind the times, the lighting in the room was horrendous. If it weren't for the bright bathroom lights, I would have had to do my makeup by candlelight.

And let's not forget about the beds. The mattress was as springy as a cricket on a trampoline. I felt like I was being bounced around all night. And to add insult to injury, our room had a lovely view of a loading dock.

But the biggest letdown of all was the lack of cleanliness in this hotel. I mean, seriously, there was blood or rust on the sheets when we arrived. Who knows what else could have been lurking. It's definitely not worth the risk to stay here again.

Overall, this stay at the Luxor has left a lot to be desired. From the dirty sheets to the terrible lighting and uncomfortable beds, I can confidently say I won't be returning. There are much better options in Vegas."

I was really excited to check out this bar above the top of the world restaurant as I had heard great things about the views. However, I have to say I was a bit disappointed overall. The atmosphere was nice and the happy hour deals were a plus, but the drinks and appetizers were not consistent. I had ordered the same drink twice and it tasted completely different each time. And the service was just okay, nothing special. I did enjoy the views and the overall atmosphere, but the inconsistency in drinks and appetizers was a letdown. I'm not sure if I would come back here again. Maybe for the views, but I might choose a different spot for drinks and appetizers."

I had to point out the mistakes over and over again to get her to fix it. Finally, she did begrudgingly fix it. \n\nI don't plan on going back to Magen Nail. That being said, there are a couple of people there that do a nice job, I am just not going to take the chance with my time and money that I end up with one of the people who do a bad job."
985,"Rollier's is exactly everything that I can remember about the local hardware store when I was growing up. I'm certain that they have someone named \""Chuck\"" that knows the answer to any of your household projects. This place has a wide variety of items that you can use to complete most of your home projects but it is not all encompassing. \n\nFor the most part their prices are right on point maybe a little on the high side but I figure that since most of the people there can find someone who can give you some real advice on your home project it is worth the slight mark-up. Although I have been mostly satisfied with Rollier's I have had a number of less than desirable experiences ranging from rudeness to being outright ripped off. Example I was sold a sink faucet spray hose that was not new, matter of fact it was so used that there was calcium deposits on it. The sink hose adapter didn't fit my sink so I had to run over to Lowe's to buy the correct fit. When I attempted to return it Rollier's accused me of using it! What I just bought this, how the heck could calcium deposits develop in under a week. And then the store manager had the nerve to ask me why I waited a week to return the faucet. Dude I travel for my job I was out of town for 4 nights. I have been back a few times since but I have hard feelings every time I bust out some cash for a purchase.\n\nAfter writing this review I think I will go to Lowe's again and just fumble through projects with advice from someone who knows little about home improvement projects. At least you can return purchases that are wrong without an inquisition!"
986,"If you're at this resort and have no means of getting into town, this isn't all that bad. Service is good and food is well prepared, but with all the other options in Scottsdale, why settle? There was actually a live Jazz singer in the lounge who was quite good, so, overall, I had a positive experience here.\n\nOne thing this place is great for is group dinners. We had a fairly small group of 6, but saw others with 10-12 in their parties sitting around long tables to accommodate."
987,"Traveled to Vegas to see Rod Stewart on our 16th Wedding anniversary. \nRod Stewart was playing at Caesar's Palace, this hotel is close by. \nThe room was ok but old, the long walks thru the casino to get anywhere was full of smoke from smokers. \nWe asked the clerk at the checkin counter where there was a fine dining restaurant, she advised the Cortez Room, there at the Gold Coast Hotel. \nThe meal at the Cortez Room was hands down is the worst meal we have ever had in Las Vegas in the 35 years traveling there. We had to send ever item back, change our order, because we could not eat what was being served, The menu it self was very old fashioned, nothing healthy. The staff just kept taking it back. \nWe observed numerous tables doing the same. There was nothing served fresh, only frozen and microwaved. The manager only comped half the meal. \nWe also complained to head of the food and beverage department. \nThis manager took our phone number and said he was going to contact us the next night to make it right, but never contacted us. The price of the meal was very expensive for this horrible menu. I even got sick the following day.\nI will never stay at the Gold Coast Hotel again.\nYou can not say that you get what you pay for, because in Vegas, the bar is usually set a lot higher, for less."

Food: I went to Majerle's Sports Grill on a Monday afternoon for lunch and decided to try their turkey sandwich. The meat was excellent, but I was a bit disappointed with the bun. It wasn't anything special and I think next time I'll ask for it on white sandwich bread instead. Along with the sandwich, I also ordered some mayo on the side. Overall, the food was decent but I wouldn't say it was anything to rave about.

Service: The service was prompt but not overly friendly. Based on the reviews I had read, I was expecting a bit more from the staff. However, they did refill my water regularly and my order was served quickly.

Establishment: The atmosphere at Majerle's is still nice after all these years. I sat at the bar and noticed a good mix of businessmen and convention attendees. It's a popular spot, especially in this location with the Convention Center across the street and sports teams nearby. There were big-screen TVs playing the games and I could see how it would be a great spot for sports fanatics.

Conclusions: Overall, Majerle's is a decent spot for a quick lunch. The prices are a bit steep, which is expected given the location, but the food and service were just average. It's definitely a great spot for sports fans, but if you're looking for something exceptional, you may want to look elsewhere. "
989,"Two co-workers and I stopped for lunch after hitting Bass Pro. We weren't expecting much, but the decor wasn't bad overall, and the chips and salsa were quite good.\n\nAll three of our meals looked pretty tasty, but were all but flavorless. I bit into an inch-long rib bone in my chicken enchiladas. Not a great experience. Service wasn't bad, but I think there was one other table in the place."

After a frustrating experience with a nearby Chinese food delivery place, I decided to give this place a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the polite phone conversation and decided to order some food. While the portions were not as generous as I had hoped, I still felt satisfied with my meal and didn't feel cheated. \n\nHowever, there was an issue with my debit card charge. Thankfully, the staff took the time to research and resolve the issue on the same day. I appreciated their prompt and efficient customer service. While this place may have lost some of its charm over the years, I still had an enjoyable time here. Plus, I couldn't help but chuckle at the slightly older waitresses who added a unique touch to the atmosphere. "

The sushi at this restaurant is always top-notch, with fresh and delicious fish. And despite the occasional slip-up, our service is usually pretty solid. However, there is one major issue that has caused us to rethink our opinion of this place - their misleading claim of being ""gluten-free friendly."" As someone with a gluten intolerance, finding restaurants that cater to my dietary needs is always a challenge. So when I saw Kabuki listed as gluten-free friendly, I was ecstatic. But after multiple visits, it became clear that this was not the case.

On our first few visits, we didn't think to ask about the wheat content of their sauces. But upon discovering that ALL of their sauces contain wheat, even the mayo, we were shocked and disappointed. We had ordered various dishes, only to find out later that they were not actually gluten-free. This could have easily been avoided if the wait staff had informed us of this fact. And when we did ask for some plain mayo or ponzu, it was like pulling teeth - our requests were met with reluctance and resistance.

To make matters worse, when we asked about wheat-free options, our waiter directed us to the vegan menu. Hello, not the same thing! It's frustrating to see such a lack of understanding and care when it comes to accommodating dietary restrictions. And let's not forget the fact that a simple ingredient like mayo should not contain wheat or soy sauce - it's totally unnecessary.

Overall, while we do enjoy the sushi at this restaurant, the lack of transparency about their sauces and the resistance to accommodating dietary restrictions has left a bad taste in our mouth. We were regulars at Kabuki, but now we're not sure if we'll be back again."
992,"food was good not great, the butter popcorn shrimp was better the other places. Cost was averge we dined in and try most of the food. Was standard mixed buffet. not a lot of asian food, sushi was not good.  The place needs make over dull and no shine to the place."

The first time my family and I visited Capriotti's, we were excited to try a taste of Delaware in Arizona. As a loyal fan of the original location, I had high expectations for this franchise expansion. The sandwiches were just as delicious as I remembered, with the signature Bobbie being an obvious standout. The turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo sandwiched between soft, fresh rolls - it was like Thanksgiving in every bite. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. But I have to admit, the absence of the Cheeze-Whiz option for their cheesesteaks was a bit of a disappointment. As someone who's frequented Pat and Geno's in Philly, I know a good cheesesteak when I taste one. However, the quality of their ingredients made up for it. The locally baked rolls, the superior lunchmeat, and perfectly shredded lettuce, this is what sets Capriotti's apart from other sub shops. However, on our second visit, there were a couple of missteps. My mom ordered the golden banana roll for dessert, which turned out to be quite dry. And the raspberry sauce that came with it was incredibly salty. When we asked our server, she seemed unsure about the dessert and had to ask the kitchen. It was clear that the cooks had no idea what had gone wrong, and we suspect that they may have accidentally used salt instead of sugar in the sauce. Nevertheless, these minor mishaps did not deter us from enjoying our delicious sandwiches. We're excited to hear that they're expanding to more locations in Phoenix, and I hope the Northwest valley is next on their list. Despite the dessert incident, we will definitely keep coming back to Capriotti's for their mouthwatering sandwiches and legendary Bobbie. Thank you for bringing a taste of home to Arizona, Capriotti's!"
994,"I placed an order on 10/10/14 around 9:40am,  using the Paypal (eat24) app on my phone. I been reading the reviews and some are good and some are not, so I decided to try it out. I got to the store at 10:10am and I told them I had placed an order and I was picking it up. I gave them my name and I had to wait 5 minutes, I could tell they forgot to do my order which was the Char-broiled caesar salad, because they were asking me what I wanted in it, when I had already specified online. My time for pick-up was 10:05am\n\nI waited and after 5 minutes someone from the kitchen gave me my food. I went home and when I opened the foam container, all I had was a Big Tortilla Bowl filled with bad lettuce(practically brown) up to the top and just a few pieces of tomatoes, 4 croutons and ONLY, I repeat ONLY 4 tiny strips of Chicken, they weren't like Chicken tender strips, all I had was  4 strips of chicken which looked like they pulled from the breast.  \n\nMy total was $10.11 for this salad, which I didn't mind at first, but this is pathetic. I would stick to Subway's Salads around the corner, even they have fresher lettuce."
995,"We came back to Stripsteak after enjoying it the previous time and found that the experience did not duplicate itself. This visit was the worst experience I have ever had at a Steakhouse. The hostess was rude and inattentive, we had a reservation for when they opened and they sat all the waiting families and wouldnt seat us! I had to go up and ask to be seated again. The waitress was okay but not very attentive to our table.\n\nThe fries were good of course, as was the salad and the soup, but then the main reason you go to a steakhouse, the steak, was awful! I cannot stress this enough, my ribeye steak was no better than a $10 steak I could buy at Wal-Mart, actually it might not have even been that good. Well over half the steak was inedible, it came out cold, as did all of our sides. I would have sent the steak back but I couldnt get the waitresses attention to come check on how the steak was. For what you are paying this place was not even close to worth it. Just plain awful experience. We will never go there again."

Just spent my birthday weekend in Vegas with my friends and after landing late on our first night, we were looking for a spot to keep the party going. Luckily, Drai's Afterhours was just a short walk from our hotel and they were still open. Excited to celebrate, we didn't mind the early arrival, and even though it was pretty dead at first, we made the most of it on the dancefloor and at the bar. The DJ was decent, taking requests only once the crowd started picking up. But let's be real, we were too busy having fun to care about the music. Speaking of the bar, the drinks were great and definitely strong enough to keep the party going. The staff were also super helpful and attentive. However, I have to give this place three stars because it's nothing too special. Sure, it's convenient and we had a good time, but I wouldn't say it's a must-visit spot in Vegas. Maybe check it out if you're in the area and want a decent party, but don't expect anything mind-blowing. Overall, Drai's Afterhours was a decent option for our first night in Vegas. "
997,"This place is quite shocking. I'm giving it one extra star for the experience.  I would say it is a place meant for people who have a fetish for gluttony. You need to be really open minded coming here.  Stepped on the large scale outside and I first weighed in at 105 lbs.  walking in I could not figure out how to enter.  I attempted to walk in through the turnstyle and failed.  Finally a nurse came and dressed me in a hospital gown.  I totally felt uncomfortable because all I could think about was being in a hospital where there are germs and sickness.  (It was a Psychological discomfort). And all of a sudden we saw people getting spanked by a midget who rides around in a mini ambulance to deliver food. It looked like it was so hard and painful!!  So as we were looking at the menu we read all these rules.  I was definitely not going to submit myself to such nonsense. I have absolutely no ass to save my life!  And it was a turn off that we would get punished for not finishing our food.  Skinny bitch was def in the wrong place.  We shared a burger and I ordered a butter fat shake.  I LOVE butter and all unhealthy delicious food, this got me excited and it tasted so yumm. But I could barely drink much it was extremely rich. The way they personalize and serve shots in a prescription bottle is really cool.  What grossed me out is that I bit into a part in my burger that was cold and hard that I could not chew. It was a large enough chunk. It was definitely the insides of a cow that I probably would not want to eat.  I made it out without punishment.  I wanted to try the wine that they serve in an IV but I was much too full. Upon leaving I weighed in at 107lbs. Can't be?  2 lbs?!"
998,"What a nightmare experience with this Dealership.  STAY AWAY!!!!!  They killed my credit even though we agreed they would use only one financial institution, they shopped me around to 40 different lenders what a disaster.

I wander if the warranty company knows they are being taken advantage of."
999,"I eat at one of these airport places a few times per week, and they are all basically the same. A couple of companies run all of them all over the country, so there isn't a lot of variance. That's really the business model, middle-of-the-road food to capture the middle of the market. They don't need to branch out and offer something spectacular because they have a basically captive audience. It's the airport, so most things are overpriced. Skip all the food, buy and drink some duty-free booze...at least you won't remember the pain of travel. If your company is paying, sit at the bar and down some $10 bloody marys..."

Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..\n\nMy only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits \""extra\"" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right? I ordered the 6 piece chicken strip meal and ran out of sauce with there limit of 3 small dipping sauce sides.\n\nAnyhow, it was good,  I just did not get the happy ending I had been hoping for...\n\nThis goes in my overrated file.... :("
1003,"Amelie's is not for everyone. This place seems to always stay packed with Hipsters (with a capital H!), students, working professionals, older folks, and the most eccentrically adorned individuals you have ever witnessed. This is primarily due to its location in the North Davidson area (NoDa). The thing that keeps me coming back is the spinach soup. I never go wrong when I order it. The desserts are okay. I tried the sweet potato bread pudding and was not impressed. I think they make the mistake with it being to eggy. As a tip to the chef, leave out the egg white and only use the egg yolk. Also, I have never been served bread pudding without some kind of sweet sauce to be drizzled over it. Mine tasted rather dry and left much to be desired in the \""sweet\"" department. Unfortunately, after my third bite, I begged one of the employees for some icing or agave. She directed me to the coffee bar and suggested honey. As outrageous as that sounds, the honey made it taste better, but definitely not a winner. The creme brulee is also okay. Perhaps a lot better than the bread pudding. I have enjoyed better, but I suppose the lower price coincides with the quality. Seating is alright, outlets are reasonable. The back of the building is quieter than the front which forever has a long line. I will say, the employees do their best to make sure you are not waiting too long though. I come back because it is a place to get work done and is open a whopping 24 hours. If my local Starbucks had the same hours, that is probably where you would find me all the time."

I have visited this club multiple times and each time, I can't help but feel like it's trying too hard to be cool. The service is subpar at best, with bouncers who act like they own the place and drinks that cost an arm and a leg (and I'm not even from the countryside, so that's saying something). 
On one occasion, we had a promoter and were able to skip the long line, but even then, it took us a good twenty minutes to get into the club. And trust me, that was just the beginning of a long night. The dance floor was overcrowded and it was hard to breathe with the smoky haze filling the air. And to top it off, my watered down drink cost me a whopping fifteen dollars. 
Sure, there were some attractive dancers and good music, but that's about it. The bouncers were rude, the managers were even worse, and the bartenders seemed to be more interested in chatting amongst themselves than serving the customers. It's no surprise that the only way I would come back here is if I were to get bottle service and a private table. And even then, there's no guarantee that the staff would actually pay attention to me. 
Honestly, save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else. This place may be a nightclub, but it completely misses the mark when it comes to creating a fun and enjoyable atmosphere for its customers. Take it from me, you'll thank me later."

They will chat with you all day about various things, but you have to be willing to give about 10 minutes more of your time whenever you place an order. \n\nI repeat this specific Wendy's is not a \""fast\"" food joint, but my order here is always right.  :)"

I recently visited this vet for my two chihuahuas to get rabies shots. However, it was quite an underwhelming experience. I believe reviews should be based on price and quality, and in this case, the price did not match the quality of service. We had been to the vet before, but this time around, they told us both of our dogs had gained three pounds since their last visit. My skinny dog was even labeled as ""overweight."" I was taken aback and told them that their scales must be off, but they insisted it was accurate. Frustrated, I decided to check their accuracy by weighing my dogs at Pets Mart. Sure enough, they were both three pounds lighter than the vet's scale had claimed. Just to be sure, I even weighed a 10-pound weight, and the Pets Mart scale was spot on. So not only is their scale inaccurate, but it also caused my entire annual visit to be based on wrong information. To make matters worse, the staff treated us as if we were ignorant and didn't know how to care for our own pets. They also charged an exorbitant amount for teeth cleaning, which I later found out was significantly higher than at other vets in the area. Overall, I would not recommend this vet. While the service was not terrible, the issues with the scale and overcharging have left a sour taste in my mouth. This experience was simply a 3-star. "
1007,"I just had a pedicure here, the staff are less than friendly and spoke to each other in Vietnamese the whole hour I was there. The massage that was part of the pedicure was nothing more than slapping some cream on my legs and feet.  I did notice that other customers were getting a better massage. The foot bath was treated as a garbage can after my foot soak.  Staff that weren't working spent their time hunched over their phones or lap top. It was a very Unprofessional experience."

This company may try to lure you in with a great deal, but beware of the fine print. I made the mistake of signing a two year contract with them and regret it immensely. First off, they increased my monthly payment within the first 9 months of my contract, which was not disclosed when I signed up. And when I woke up this morning to discover that they had dropped several of my favorite channels, including Comedy Central, I called to cancel my service. But of course, I was met with a $300 cancellation fee. When I pointed out that they were no longer providing the channels I had signed up for, they simply shrugged and stated that their contracts allow for programming changes. This is a perfect example of a company that only cares about taking your money and not providing the services they originally promised. Don't be fooled by their offerings, there are plenty of other TV providers out there that won't try to manipulate you into a binding contract. Save yourself the stress and don't sign up with Directv. You'll thank me later."

My experience at this hotel was a disaster from start to finish. My friends and I were in town for a music festival and decided to stay at this hotel because of its convenient location. However, from the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was not going to be a smooth stay. The front desk staff seemed disorganized and uninterested in assisting us. Despite making reservations months in advance, our room was not ready when we arrived and we had to wait for over an hour to check in. 

Once we finally got to our room, we were shocked at the quality. It was not only outdated, but also dirty and smelled musty. We immediately requested a room change and were told that there were no other available rooms. We ended up spending the weekend in a damp, uncomfortable room that did not make for a pleasant stay. 

The pool area, which we were looking forward to, was a disappointment as well. It was overcrowded and the staff seemed overwhelmed and unable to keep up with the maintenance of the area. Not to mention, the construction noise from the ongoing remodel was disruptive and made it difficult to relax. 

One of the positives was the helpfulness of one of the off-duty employees who came to our aid when we got lost on the hotel grounds. Otherwise, the overall lack of professionalism and poor customer service from the rest of the staff overshadowed any good experiences we had. 

I would not recommend this hotel, especially for a special occasion such as a music festival or a wedding. Save yourself the stress and find another place to stay."
1010,Unfortunately I have to drop my review down a star. I stopped in for lunch on 12/23 and they have done away w/gluten free options which is such a terrible idea being that many people suffer from celiac or gluten allergies.  The waitress said they also removed the wheat pasta for those who are health conscious. I won't be returning for that reason alone and hope that corporate will rethink their choice for removing such items.

While I have always been intrigued by the bright gold exterior of this hotel every time I've driven by, my recent stay has left me questioning my initial curiosity. The convenience of free parking and a quick check-in process were overshadowed by the lackluster location, 5-7 miles away from the strip. Our room, while spacious and clean, was unfortunately lacking in any true sense of luxury. We were unable to fully take advantage of the advertised amenities, such as the bowling alley and movie theater, and could only spare a brief visit to the average-sized, family-friendly pool. One positive aspect was the fair pricing of drinks, significantly lower than those offered on the strip. Overall, this hotel may serve its purpose for those seeking an affordable alternative to the bustling Vegas scene, but it falls short for those in search of a more memorable and glamorous experience."

I wanted to like this place, I really did. But sadly, I left feeling disappointed and misled. As someone who values a healthy lifestyle, I was drawn in by the idea of a nutritious, whole-ingredient smoothie. But upon closer inspection, I realized that the menu was full of misinformation. The shakes and teas were made with powders and syrups, with no real fruits or vegetables in sight. And to top it off, the smoothie I ordered tasted artificial and unsatisfying.

What's more concerning is that this place is just another front for an MLM scheme. Not only is the product ineffective, but it also perpetuates a pyramid marketing strategy. And to think, I paid $7 for a subpar shake that offered no real nutritional value. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here anytime soon.

Sure, the store may be small and the service may be friendly, but that doesn't make up for the false advertising and lack of genuine ingredients. With so many other options in the area, I suggest giving this place a pass. Don't be fooled by the friendly atmosphere, because at the end of the day, that's all it is - a facade for a questionable product. Save your money and your health, and steer clear of this place."

I was excited to try breakfast at the Public Market Grocery, especially after my great experience at the market next door. But unfortunately, my experience here was not as enjoyable as I had hoped. First of all, the service was a bit odd. I was greeted by a friendly waitress, but then it seemed as though she passed off my order to another, less friendly waitress. And then my food and drinks were brought out by different servers who had no idea who ordered what.

Despite the friendly atmosphere and beautiful patio, the food left much to be desired. I ordered the quiche du jour and was pleasantly surprised by the delicious mix of flavors. However, it was served with a side of mixed purple and gold potatoes that were undercooked and lacked any seasoning. And let's talk about the seating options - either too sunny and hot outside or too dark and cold inside. It's a shame they can't find a happy medium.

I also tried the blueberry lemonade, which sounded like a great concept, but unfortunately, the blueberry skins were not strained out and I found myself constantly fiddling with my straw to try and avoid them. And the loaded chip app with caramelized onions, bacon, and blue cheese had the potential to be amazing, but the chips were greasy and overdone, making it difficult to finish.

Overall, while I appreciated the ambiance and prime people-watching on the patio, I was disappointed by the lackluster service and hit-or-miss food at the Public Market Grocery. Perhaps sticking to my usual large iced Americano from Royal at the Market would have been a better option for my Saturday morning breakfast. "

I had high hopes for this restaurant, and unfortunately, it fell short in one major aspect - service. Despite having made a reservation, my party and I had to wait for a whopping 15-20 minutes before being seated. And even then, it took forever for us to be served. To make matters worse, there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant. I understand that it's a small establishment, but that's still not an excuse for such understaffing.

To add insult to injury, our waitress was in a terrible mood and barely acknowledged us the entire time. I asked for clarification on which plates were which (we ordered AYCE), and she acted as if I was wasting her time. It's a shame because the food was actually quite good. The nigiri was fresh and delicious, but the service just ruined the experience.

With such poor service, it's hard to justify giving this place a higher rating. I know that having one bad experience does not necessarily reflect the entire establishment, but it still left a sour taste in my mouth. I would recommend this place for the food, but be prepared for subpar service. I hope they can improve in this aspect in the future."
1015,"As you can tell by all the other reviews, the food is good and at times great.  The service makes you want to walk out, while waiting for your food.  I went just this past week and waited for about twenty minutes while being two of ten people who were there.  It is ridiculous.  Everytime I go, I always say I'm going to call my order ahead next time, so that I do not have to wait .  The dining area itself is a mess, and it can be a little intrusive if someone is market shopping in front of your table.  As many negatives this place has I always go back.  If your in the mood for a good sammy lunch, this is the place in old town."

The Place
I have to hand it to my sister, she knows her way around a car and won't let anyone take advantage of her. But we decided to take her van to Pep Boys because of their convenient location and reputation for good service. Walking into the shop, we were greeted with a bright and clean waiting area, and the staff seemed friendly and efficient. But as soon as we got the service estimate for $1,300, we were taken aback. It seemed excessive for a van that was just running a little rough.

The Service
Feeling uneasy about the estimate, my sister took the van to a smaller, local repair shop. The owner took a look at the van and quickly diagnosed a loose ignition connector. He had it repaired in no time for a fraction of the price that Pep Boys had quoted us. And when we drove the van back home, it ran like a top! We were both relieved and grateful to have avoided paying an exorbitant amount for a simple repair.

The Pep Boys Experience
I have to say, I was disappointed with Pep Boys. Their reputation and appearance gave us high expectations, but the service and price definitely fell short. It just makes me wonder if they were trying to take advantage of my sister because she's a woman. It's frustrating to think that a company would still do that in this day and age. Sorry Pep Boys, but you shouldn't try to rip off women like that. Might I suggest updating your practices to the 21st century?

The Serendipitous Moment
At the end of the day, I'm glad we had this experience because it led us to discover the mom and pop repair shop that gave us excellent and honest service. It just goes to show that sometimes, things happen for a reason and we stumble upon unexpected gems, like this amazing repair shop. Sorry Pep Boys, you just don't compare to the quality and integrity of this smaller shop. Lesson learned, always trust your gut and don't be afraid to seek out alternative options. It might just lead you to a serendipitous moment!"

I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, the food is delicious and the drink menu is creative. But on the other hand, the staff seems to have some major issues. I've been here four times now and each time, I can't help but notice the chaos behind the bar. It's like they're trying to run a dating service instead of a restaurant. And let's talk about the prices. It's like paying strip club prices for groceries. Hello, this is not Vegas. I understand wanting to attract a local crowd, but with these prices, I think I'll stick to my neighborhood supermarket. Speaking of the supermarket, let's chat about customer service. The employees seem to be wandering off for lunch instead of restocking and cleaning. And the produce section? It reminded me of the old Parking Shop on Wilkerson Blvd, if you catch my drift. Please, for the love of Alton Brown, stock fresher produce. And while you're at it, put some prices on your ground turkey. Overall, I'm not sure if this was just an off night or if it's a common occurrence, but I'll probably be sticking to other options for now. Sorry, BiLo. Maybe try to get your act together in the future."

I had been wanting to give Little Texas a try for a while now, and finally got the chance to visit this weekend. The burger and fries were definitely the highlight of my meal. The burger was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of juiciness. It's clear that the owners take pride in their food and service, as they were both excellent.

The menu selection is a bit limited, but I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of items they offer. From ribs and steaks to salads and sandwiches, there's something for everyone. And let me tell you, the smell of those baby back ribs was irresistible.

My only disappointment was the location. Tucked away in an old strip mall behind another restaurant, Little Texas may be a bit hard to find for first-time visitors. But once you do find it, you'll realize it's a hidden gem. The cozy atmosphere and friendly service make it a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner.

While my experience was overall enjoyable, I couldn't help but wish for a bit more creativity in the menu. But who knows, maybe those baby back ribs I plan on trying next time will change my mind. Until then, I'll just have to settle for the fantastic burger and fries."

The atmosphere of this place is enough to turn your appetite off. It's crowded and dirty, with a constant steamy smell and questionable staff. The food is no better - I've had better meals in a mess hall. The only redeeming quality is the free meal they offer to veterans on Veterans Day. But even that doesn't make up for the overall unpleasant experience. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place at all costs."
1020,"What a disappointment. From the outside and menu selection, La Comida showed a lot of promise. However, when the food arrived, things quickly went downhill. This restaurant is not authentic, and the food just isn't good. \n\nWe ordered queso fundido. It's basically melted cheese and extremely hard to mess up. I've eaten this appetizer a million times at a million restaurants. The only way you can ruin this is by buying the cheapest cheese that probably isn't meant to be melted. There was a think layer of grease over the cheese, and it tasted like rubber.\n\nMy tacos were okay. My margarita, which I take very seriously, was a joke and completely overpriced. That's the problem with this place. The food is mediocre and way overpriced."
1021,"Been here a bunch of times. Last night was very disappointing. We had a group of about 20+ people (male and female) to celebrate 3 birthdays. Everyone got in except 1 of my male friends. He was told there was a $50-$100 cover charge because it was after 1130 when in fact we all got in after 1130. A \""manager\"" named josh and whoever was working at the door were complete jerks. Not people that should be working the front door anywhere  if you want people to return to your business."

I finally got to try this place and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long! The service was top-notch and the atmosphere was laid back but still upscale. I could tell that this is a popular spot because it was packed even on a weekday. I ordered their speciality cocktail and it did not disappoint - it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. As for the food, I went with the recommendations of our server and got the signature dish. The flavors were unique and delicious, and the presentation was Instagram-worthy. I will definitely be coming back to try more dishes and maybe even attend one of their events. It's safe to say that this place is my new go-to spot in the West Valley, and I'm already planning my next visit. Don't make the same mistake I did and miss out on this gem of a restaurant - it's a must-try for any foodie in the area!"
1023,"I was looking forward to eating here after reading about it online and in the newspaper, but was sadly disappointed.  Made special trip to Red Rock casino to try it out on Saturday June 28.  It was pretty empty, especially for a weekend.  My husband ordered a polish dog, and was very disappointed they don't have sauerkraut.  I originally ordered a coney dog and was disappointed they don't serve chili.  I have never heard of a hot dog place that doesn't serve sauerkraut and chili!  Anyway, I ended up ordering the dogs in a blanket.  We shared an order of fries and got two sodas, and our tab came to $27 and change, which is ridiculous for hotdogs, even in a Vegas (off Strip) casino.  I wouldn't have minded the cost if the food was as good as the Pinks (which was formerly in this location) or Nathan's, but it wasn't.  The \""blanket\"" portion of my dogs in a blanket was undercooked, and my food tasted like hot dogs wrapped in raw dough.  The fries tasted as though they  had been prepared in old grease and were limp and oily.  My husband said his polish dog was decent, yet he was still disappointed it had no kraut.  I will say the worker who delivered our food to the table was friendly, although the woman who took our order not so much.  I wish Pinks had never left this location, they were so much better!   Anyway, we feel we paid too much for subpar food and will not be back."

Let me start by saying that I used to be a big fan of this place. But times have changed and so has my opinion. While I can't pinpoint the exact year it started, I can confidently say that it's been at least three years since I've had a positive experience here. The main issue for me is the lackadaisical attitude of the young employees who seem more interested in scrolling through their phones than providing good service. A sandwich without properly washed hands is a big red flag in my book, and don't even get me started on the cleanliness of cell phones. But that's not the only disappointment. The prices here are outrageous. I mean, I get that it's a local spot with a unique vibe, but when I can get a full meal at another sandwich joint for the same price as one here, it's hard to justify the expense. And let's face it, while the decor is fun and quirky, it's not worth paying extra for when the product and service don't deliver. I'll be taking my business elsewhere where I can actually get my money's worth."
1025,"So when someone puts a lot of subpar food on my plate it really just leads to a lot of subpar food getting thrown out.  I wish this place would focus more on quality than quantity.  I ordered the meat combo that featured ham, sausage, and bacon.  The ham was just okay, the sausage was lame, and the bacon was too hard.  The 6 pounds of hashed-browns that were under all of this meat were terrible.  The only saving grace were my eggs.  They were some of the best scrambled eggs ever.  Nothing special about them, they were just the perfect flavor, texture, and consistency.  \n\nThe service was good and the place is cute.  I enjoyed looking at the license plates on the wall and they have some train that gives out free food.  Those are good things, I think."

After receiving a new job offer, I found myself back in the area and decided to give Long Wongs another try. I remembered their famous hot wings and couldn't resist. However, my son and I were extremely disappointed with our recent experience. The new remodel did little to improve the overall atmosphere - it still felt dark and dingy. But that was just the beginning of our disappointment.

The service was slow and the employees seemed uninterested in our presence. When our hot wings finally arrived, they were anything but fresh and piping hot. In fact, they were lukewarm and lacked the signature spice and flavor we remembered. To make matters worse, the prices had skyrocketed and they were still cash only. But the biggest issue came when we received our bill. After being promised a hot wing ""run,"" we were charged separately for each flavor we requested. When we brought this to the attention of our server, she simply shrugged and said that's how they do it now.

To top it all off, we later discovered that Long Wongs has a history of health code violations. After doing some research, my son and I were horrified to find that this restaurant has a long list of unsanitary practices. Needless to say, we will never be returning to this establishment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, unless food poisoning is on your bucket list. Save yourself the trouble and find a different wing joint."
1027,"Every friend I have in the area just RAVES about this restaurant and its sliders, but i just dont see it. I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.  \n\nThe building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  \n\nI had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   \n\nAs for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? \n\nThe one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.\n\nI want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option."
1028,"What is it about Las Vegas and its lack of good Chinese takeout? Are there cosmic Asian forces at work that keep finger-licking Kung Pao chicken or delectable broccoli beef far way from our boozy, desert collective, or are all the solid Chinese chefs locked in at proper sit-down restaurants on the Strip? \nRegardless of why the sleeping dragon of delicious Chinese takeout has never awoken in our little corner of the Mojave, I had high hopes for Chop Chop Wok.\nReading the reviews here on Yelp convinced me - dare I say - that might have finally found THE spot. You know, the kind of solid New York City-style takeout joint whose Mongolian beef melts in the mouth. Where the sweet-and-sour chicken is a stack of crunchy, honeyed bonbons of poultry goodness. Where the rice sucks you down into pillowy rivers of starch so delicious that you never want to come up for air.\nMan, did I have another thing coming.\nChop Chop Wok, unfortunately, is like a lot of neighborhood Chinese takeout joints here in Vegas: That is to say, it's run by a small coterie of smiling, accommodating folks ... who haven't the slightest idea how to turn out tasty dishes that trace their roots far back into the misty history of the Middle Kingdom.\nWhich is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's. \nWe tried a variety of dishes, but everything from the egg rolls to the crab rangoons to the beef and chicken dishes disappointed. \nWe're sorry, Chop Chop Wok. You're a bunch of truly nice people. But for those of us who've managed to find great Chinese takeout from Manhattan to the Midwest, we were hoping for so much more."

I stumbled upon Marleys while searching for a place to grab dinner during a business trip, and I have to say, it was worth the extra effort to find it. The service was top-notch and the atmosphere was relaxed and inviting. My husband and I decided to try the burger and flatbread chicken, and both were satisfying options. While the burger was good, the real standout was the flatbread chicken. The flavors were perfectly balanced and left us wanting more. The prices were reasonable and the portion sizes were generous. One slight downside was the seating, which seemed to cater to taller individuals. As someone who is on the shorter side, I found myself feeling a bit uncomfortable in the chairs. Overall, Marleys is a solid choice for a nice dinner out, but it may not be the best option for those with a smaller stature. "

I had high hopes for this place when my friends suggested we go there for a night out. The Yelp reviews were decent and we were in the mood for some good bar food and drinks. But let me tell you, the cold temperature inside was definitely a mood killer.

Despite the scorching heat outside, the restaurant was frigid. I couldn't help but wonder if it was purposely kept that way to showcase the waitresses' assets. But let me tell you, it was not comfortable at all. And to make matters worse, the service was lacking. I couldn't believe that they hire servers based on looks rather than skill. And even then, most of them weren't even that good looking. They were just average with fake boobs and bleached blonde hair. What happened to the three talented bartenders that used to work here? I was told they were no longer employed.

The drinks were also not worth the expensive price tag. And the fact that I had to bring a sweater in the middle of summer just to stay warm is ridiculous. Despite the decent food and nice decor, the overall experience was underwhelming due to the uncomfortable temperature and lackluster service. I don't think I'll be returning to this place anytime soon, especially with so many other options at the same price range in the area. Maybe if they focus on hiring skilled servers and fixing the temperature issue, I might reconsider. But until then, I'll be enjoying my nights elsewhere."

She forgot to place an order for us three different times and we kept having to ask someone else for help.

Food was ok, but not worth everything else involved."

If you're looking for an exceptional Mexican dining experience, this may not be the place for you. While it's not terrible, it's definitely not the top choice for authentic Mexican cuisine. It's more like trying to get a gourmet steak at Applebee's - you might get a decent meal, but it won't knock your socks off. 

Personally, I only really go for their happy hour deals. And let me tell you, the free appetizers make it worth it! Who doesn't love mini chimichangas, chips and salsa, and taquitos? Plus, if you sit in the bar, these goodies are on the house. 

But before you get too excited, be warned that margaritas are not included in the happy hour specials. I know, it's practically blasphemy. And on Fridays, they have a DJ, so it's a bit of a party ambiance. 

However, I have to say that this particular location has been going through some major renovations lately. And with the new light rail station being built right next to their patio, I have a feeling this place will be packed during happy hour all week long. So while it may not be the best spot for great Mexican food, it's definitely a prime location for some post-work drinks and free appetizers."

I had high hopes for this place after hearing about their awesome prices on meats. A 15-minute drive seemed worth it for quality and affordable products. However, upon arrival, I was disappointed to find that the prices had increased to match those of other stores. And it didn't stop there - I decided to grab some fruit and veggies only to find them spoiled the very next day. Talk about a waste of money and a major inconvenience. What's the point of making a trip all the way there if the products don't even last? 

But the real kicker was the service, or lack thereof. My family and I wanted to enjoy the lovely patio area, but were completely ignored for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, a table next to us, who arrived after us, was already being served. It was as if we were invisible. No acknowledgement, no attention, nothing. And when we finally had enough and decided to leave, not a single staff member even looked our way. It was clear that they didn't care about their customers. 

We left feeling unsettled and disrespected. The manager's offer of a free appetizer for our ""next visit"" did nothing to make up for such a terrible experience. We've never been treated with such disregard at a restaurant before. The only saving grace for this place is the outdoor area, but even that is not enough to entice us to return. Save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere. This is one place that definitely does not deserve any patronage."

Intention Review: Although I was initially impressed by the friendly staff, particularly Dr. Blank, and the overall cleanliness of the facility, my experience at this pediatric clinic ultimately fell short. The wait times are simply unbearable, with an average wait of 1-1.5 hours. As a busy parent with a 6-year-old and a 2-year-old, this is just not feasible. Additionally, there is no designated play area for children to pass the time, which makes for a very restless and unhappy wait. \n\nTo make matters worse, Dr. Blank's young assistant, a short-haired Latin woman, was very unfriendly and rough with my children while administering their vaccinations. She seemed disinterested and almost distant, lacking any gentleness or warmth towards young patients. This is definitely a no-go for a pediatric clinic. Overall, while the staff may be nice, the wait times and lack of child-friendly amenities make this clinic not worth the hassle."

We were in a time crunch and needed a quick snack before our dinner reservation. We decided to try this place out for some simple hotdogs and fries. What a mistake. The service was the worst we've experienced. The food preparer initially forgot about our second order of fries, and when she finally remembered, she moved at a snail's pace to make more. We were told to wait for our fries so that they wouldn't get cold, but they ended up giving our only order to the next customer. We were so frustrated and had to wait an extra 15 minutes for our food. In most places, you can at least sit and eat the rest of your order while you wait, but not here. And there was no warning about the wait before we placed our order. When we finally got our food, the hotdogs were nothing special and the fries were scorching hot. The only decent thing about the whole experience were the orange drinks. Needless to say, we will never be returning to this place. Don't waste your time."

I have to admit, I had high hopes for this place. The dark and cold weather outside made the thought of a hot bowl of ramen noodles all the more enticing. Plus, the website looked amazing and the yelp reviews were pretty good. So, you can imagine my disappointment when the reality of this restaurant fell short of my expectations.

Let's start with the positives - the atmosphere was nice and cozy and the menu had a decent selection of affordable dishes. We decided to try the spicy miso ramen and were happy to find a perfectly cooked egg in our bowl.

But, as I sat at the bar, I couldn't help but notice that our food was being prepared with frozen ingredients. I mean, come on, a frozen piece of katsu in the deep fryer? That katsu ended up tasting like cardboard, and I'm pretty sure it was the same thickness too. And it wasn't just the katsu, throughout the night I saw the cook using frozen tempura and who knows what else. It wouldn't surprise me if the noodles were packaged and the broth was loaded with MSG.

I have to give them some credit though, the okonomiyaki was decent. But even that was lacking, with a stingy amount of bonito flakes, mayo, and teriyaki sauce. Overall, the noodles and broth were completely forgettable.

After a long walk to get to this place, we left still feeling a bit hungry and incredibly let down. Seriously, never again. "

It's also safe say D'lish is looking to be major hotspot of mine in the coming months! With the right mindset I know you will enjoy it here too.\n\nI would imagine many passers by give D'lish an unapologetic look. The truly lackluster curb appeal reeks with the facade of a failed and dirty restaurant. Keep in mind the word facade though. D'lish makes up for its looks in what it cooks.\n\nHealth is the focus here. Minimal portion sizes and apparently organic/natural ingredients are meant to keep even the more hearty choices at a low health concern. The burgers (what I ordered on my first visit) are meatless. Instead a wonderfully blended patty of quinoa and black beans is served between artisan bread and a slew of great tasting condiments and toppings. The \""Top Notch\"" burger is my personal favorite however many prefer the healthier option with pesto on it. Either way your taste buds will thank you!\n\nBreakfast burritos seem to be a popular item on the menu. Hence my choice in ordering one during my second visit. It's a no-frills burrito with hardly a garnish in sight, but with such high quality ingredients being cooked with careful skill and precision nothing stands in it's way to becoming the perfect breakfast meal. \n\nTry the coffee and tea too! Their dirty chai is one of the best I've ever had. \n\nTake heed, D'lish is EXPENSIVE for what you're getting. A burger is $8.50. No fries. No salad. No drink. In fact, buying a medium dirty chai tea will run you a hefty $4.75. Health is the key at D'lish, but the almost $14 price tag just does not make it plausible for a college student such as I to make frequent visits, especially if the portions are so minuscule. An unfortunate setback in an otherwise fairly perfect experience.\n\nTry it out for yourself though! Maybe the price won't bother you as much as it did me."

I recently stayed at this hotel during my solo trip to Vegas and I must say, I was not impressed. I had originally planned on trying out a different hotel, but decided to save some money and stay at The Orleans. Big mistake. The room itself was decent, but nothing special. The real disappointment came when I decided to dine at one of their on-site restaurants. I won't mention which one, but let's just say I was not impressed with their limited menu options. I settled for the steak thai wrap, but after just 3 bites, I had to toss it. And let me tell you, I was paying for that decision for the next 4 hours. I couldn't believe what I had just consumed. It was a good thing I had other plans for my time in Vegas, because I definitely didn't want to waste any more money on the food here.

I decided to try out this place after a friend recommended it for a date spot. I had a big event coming up and I wanted to impress my date by suggesting a unique restaurant. However, my experience at this place left much to be desired. Despite calling ahead to confirm my appointment, things didn't go as smoothly as I had hoped. As I arrived for my 2:15 reservation, I was greeted by a lady who promptly took my nail polish and instructed me to choose a gel manicure and express pedicure. The pedicure itself went by without much interaction, which I didn't mind since I just wanted to relax. However, as we moved onto the manicure, things took a turn for the worse. Not only were the tools not properly packaged, but I also noticed my cuticles were getting torn out. The manicurist poured some blue liquid over my nails, which burned like hell. I was in pain for the rest of the service and by the time I left at 2:45, I felt like I had been rushed through the whole experience. On top of that, my fingers still had blood in the cuticles even after washing my hands. To make things worse, I saw the manicurist throwing all the tools in a bucket of water before I left, which made me question the cleanliness of this place. Overall, my visit to this nail salon was disappointing and left me with concerns about their sanitary practices. I would not recommend this place, especially not for a special occasion like my upcoming event."

I had high hopes for this pizzeria, having grown up in New York and missing the taste of authentic deli sandwiches. My first impression upon entering was the charming old-school feel of the place, reminding me of my favorite spots back home. However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment as I waited endlessly for someone to take our order. When our food finally arrived, my friend's sandwich was missing altogether. After waiting another 15 minutes, they came back to ask for his order again. It's a shame that the great atmosphere and promise of authentic New York-style fare was overshadowed by such poor service. And to top it off, the prices were exorbitant for the quality of food we received. Unfortunately, I won't be returning to this pizzeria again. "

Compared to other steakhouses, it is definitely not the best. The meats could have been better seasoned. My favorite part about this type of steakhouse is the delicious cheese-filled bread, and here it wasn't fresh and wasn't warm, so I was very disapppointed. The salad bar is nothing special, not that I'm going for that anyway so let's move on to the meats. The lambchops were exquisite. That being said, every other single cut of meat was underwhelming. It was juicy, but not very well seasoned. And it took forever for them to bring out the specific cuts of meat requested.

With a bit of study, I found that Crisco, which is composed of hydro-oils, was in use in the 20s. So, perhaps they didn't lie about the recipes. However, the points about the dangers of hydrogenated oils and their ridiculous prices still stand, so *you* should \""stand\"" on the outside of their establishment."

There are several issues I had with my experience at this CVS Pharmacy, and unfortunately they all added up to create a less-than-satisfying experience. First off, the communication between the staff and customers needs some serious improvement. When picking up prescriptions, I shouldn't have to shout my personal information in front of a store full of people. It's not only uncomfortable, but also a major security concern. Strike one.

My second strike came when I dropped off my prescription at 11AM and was told it would be ready by 3PM. When I arrived at the designated time, I was informed that there was a delay and I would have to come back in 15 minutes. I understand that things happen and things can get backed up, but it would have been nice to receive some communication about the delay instead of just having to wait around without any update. Strike two.

And finally, strike three came when I brought back a prescription that was not what I had requested. The pharmacist I spoke with seemed less than sympathetic and almost annoyed that I needed something different. It's already frustrating to have to go back and fix a mistake, but to be met with such indifference is just disappointing. It seemed as though they just wanted me to hurry up and leave so they could get back to whatever they were doing. Strike three.

While the store employees may be friendly and helpful, I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy about my overall experience. It's clear that some improvements need to be made in terms of communication and customer service. I've come to expect more from a pharmacy, especially when it comes to something as important as healthcare. Hopefully, these issues can be addressed and the service can improve in the future."

I think the gal who serves in front is the owner also. Man, I agree with some fellow yelpers, how did the business still manage to survive?"

It was Saturday night in Vegas and my twin sister and I were in a rush to find a dinner spot near our hotel and show. After searching high and low, we decided to try our luck at Postrio based on the great reviews we found on Yelp. But boy, were we disappointed. 

First off, let me give some credit where it's due: we were promptly seated in the outdoor patio area and our waiter was quick and efficient. However, that's where the positives end. The calamari we ordered as an appetizer was nothing special, lacking flavor and being a bit too chewy. But the real letdown came with our main courses. My sister's herb pappardelle was underwhelming, with a creamy but bland sauce and overcooked noodles. And as for my prime rib eye, let's just say it looked like it had been slapped on the plate without any care or presentation. The meat was tough and lacking in flavor, making me wish I had just ordered the pasta. 

To make matters worse, the drinks were expensive and not even worth it. We opted to skip on alcohol since we had been drinking for free all day, but even the non-alcoholic options were overpriced and unimpressive. And just when we thought things couldn't get any worse, our entrees were served in small portions that left us feeling unsatisfied. 

The only saving grace was the complimentary birthday tiramisu, which was a nice gesture but couldn't make up for the lackluster meal we had just endured. In the future, I'll be sure to read reviews and do my research before blindly trusting a restaurant based on a celebrity chef's name. Needless to say, we won't be returning to Postrio on our next Vegas trip. "
1054,"Its my second time here and right from the start we got told by the hostess that we could not sitio at the second level, its a beautiful sunny day on a Sunday afternoon and the spot to be its up in the second floor with the view of scottsdales oldtown streets and view of the mountains, so we decided to go upstairs anyways and met Austin the bartender and took care of us."

One of my friends recommended this pizza place and I had high hopes after hearing all the rave reviews. However, I quickly realized that this place is not for everyone. Let me explain. If you're expecting a typical New York style pizza, you may be disappointed. But if you go in with an open mind, you may be pleasantly surprised. The staff is friendly and the prices are decent, but the restaurant itself is definitely not the cleanest. Don't let that deter you though, the pizza is top-notch. The crust is perfectly crispy and the toppings are always fresh. However, I couldn't give it a higher rating because it just didn't meet my expectations. I wanted to love this place, but the pizza just didn't taste right to me. Overall, it's a solid option for pizza in Phoenix, but don't go in expecting a New York style pie."
1056,Good food for the money.  Located inside the Tuscany Casino.\n\nWe ate here over the course of our three day stay while attending a convention.  Average price ranged from $7-10.   You can't go wrong.\n\nPros - plenty of seating.  Solid American food.  Cheap and plenty.\n\nCons - food served fairly lukewarm like my pancakes and corn beef hash.\n\nOpened 24 hours daily.  Lots of to go orders.

I decided to check out this spot after hearing so much buzz about it. The building was impressive and the ambience gave off a chic vibe, but in an attempt to be fancy, they seemed to have lost the charm of New Orleans. Speaking of losing, the Sazerac was disappointingly watered down. However, my taste buds were revitalized by the charbroiled oyster appetizer - it was a standout. The Caeser salad was decent, with a hearty portion for a half salad. But then came the Atchaya...the half catfish and half crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e was a divine explosion of flavors. However, the same can't be said for the jambalaya that followed. It tasted like they dumped an entire box of spices that were not mixed at all. I swear, I managed to get every single spice in one big, powdery bite. And to add insult to injury, despite ordering it with shrimp and chicken, it came without shrimp and with the worst andouille sausage on the planet. I mean, it was like a spicy, sad hot dog from a ballpark. Things took a turn for the better with the banana fosters, but the use of little to no Myers rum to caramelize the bananas just didn't cut it. They were practically green and not at all sweet. Service was fine, no major complaints other than it being a bit slow. Overall, the location and atmosphere were great, but the food and drinks left much to be desired. Maybe with some staff and menu changes, this place can live up to its potential and truly bring a taste of New Orleans to our city streets."
1058,"Food was nowhere near as good as it was when we visited last year. Had the  chicken and waffles, both pieces of chick had the leg none still attached when we were here a year ago it was all boneless chicken. Also the chicken was dry and the breading flavorless."
1059,"After reading the word of the Yelpers, I decided to stray from my Bellagio buffet to try the Wynn.  WHOOPS!\nYou guys totally let me down.  The crab was still frozen and small!! The prawns were limp!! The wasabi was more like pudding!! The rolls were unappetizing.  I could go on and on.  The only thing I liked were the pulled pork pesto sandwich, candied apples and icecream.  Still nothing special.\nForget this place hit up Bellagio's buffet.  Same price WAY better consistent quality!"

I have been a patient of Dr. J for almost ten years now and I must say, my experience with him and his clinic has been nothing short of a headache. I have referred him to my family and friends in the past, but I will definitely not be doing that anymore. Dr. J may seem like a great doctor on the surface, but his actions speak otherwise.

Firstly, I have had multiple instances where I did not receive the required 30-day notice for an increase in my insurance payments. This left me scrambling to make ends meet and caused a lot of unnecessary stress and financial burden. And if that wasn't enough, every time I tried to reach out to the clinic, my calls and emails were never returned. It's extremely disappointing to see such unprofessionalism from a healthcare provider.

On top of that, I have also been charged late fees for my payments, even though I had already paid my bills on time. It's clear that this clinic is more concerned about making money than actually providing quality healthcare to their patients. And let's not forget about Claudia De La Rocha - her rude and dismissive behavior is the icing on the cake.

I cannot express enough how much I regret choosing Dr. J as my Family Care Physician. I hate waiting for hours to be seen by a doctor who only spends a few minutes with me and doesn't even bother explaining the actual cause of my concerns. Save yourself the time, money, and stress and avoid this clinic at all costs. There are plenty of other competent and professional doctors out there - don't waste your time on this one.

I stumbled upon this store during my trip to The Forum Shops and I have to say, it was quite an interesting experience. As a non-glamorous tourist, I found the store to have a cool atmosphere and even had a terrarium with live snakes - a unique touch that added to the overall vibe. The concert venue and outdoor seating were also great perks.

However, I can see how the locals or cowboys might find this place a bit kitschy. For me, it was a fun visit, but I could definitely understand why it might be off-putting to those who are more accustomed to a certain lifestyle. On top of that, I have to agree with the other reviewer that the employees were quite snotty. Despite their attitude, I persevered and managed to find the perfect pair of shades with the help of the friendly Asian employee who went out of her way to assist me.

My only real issue with this place is the absurd 50 cent charge for BBQ sauce. I mean, seriously? And to top it off, it's just bottled sauce from the grocery store. If you're going to charge for something, it better be worth it. But overall, I would say it's not a bad spot to stop by if you're in the area. Just be prepared to overlook the pretentious staff and maybe bring your own sauce."
1062,"A strong 3 stars. Nu provides a decent, but far from overwhelming experience - in fact a slightly disappointing experience, and we got out of it with a \""meh\"" on the lips. It is good, no, better than most restaurants on Murray, but it is not as good as it should.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks fine (it shares its door with Pamela): there is enough space between tables, simple furniture, open kitchen, decent light.\n\nThe food was not overwhelming. The blintzes with meat (appetizer) were the best dish of the lunch. We  particularly enjoyed the horseradish remoulade that went with it (the highlight of the lunch imo). \n\nThe jewish penicillin with the matzo ball and pasta was quite bland, and I have had many better chicken broths. The brisket sandwich was quite tasty, although not light. \n\nPrices are fine. A complaint: they clean tables with a smelly product. Surely they know that taste and smell influence each other, and smelling cleaning product is quite unpleasant when the nearby table is being cleaned."
1063,"Uh, ok, type of place. This is a sister-place of Michelangelo coffee house that's on upper State Street. So they have the same coffee, tea, pastry, and cake ... selections. I kind of liked their hot sandwich service. That is, if you prefer, you can ask them to toast their pre-made sandwich on their panini machine. I thought it was nice touch. It sort of makes up for the fact that in this town, you can't get made-to-order sandwich in a coffee shop (I miss SF Bay Area). Bring cash, or you'll have to withdraw money from their ATM machine with $2 fee - and realize that with that $2, you could buy a cup of Joe."

First, it's important to mention that this review is not driven by a negative experience, but rather by a desire to inform others about the disappointing service at this restaurant. Let's start with the food - the walnut shrimp was average, nothing special. The orange beef, which typically stands out as a favorite for non-authentic dishes, was a huge disappointment. The meat was chewy and the batter was soggy, definitely not what one would expect. In terms of side dishes, the vegetable stir fry was a basic mix of carrots, broccoli, and snap peas, which was executed decently but still not enough to make up for the rest of the meal. And let's not forget about the upcharge fee for brown rice instead of white rice - really? The cherry on top of this dissatisfying experience was the milk tea with boba at the promotional price of $1. Unfortunately, the boba was hard, as if it had been sitting there for far too long. Not even the discounted price could entice me to go for a second. All in all, I can confidently say that I will not be returning to this restaurant, especially since I have experienced much better options elsewhere."

I was really hoping to like this casino because it's in a convenient location and I enjoy supporting local businesses. However, my recent visit left me disappointed. The quality of the slot machines and table games was subpar compared to the glitz and glamour of the strip casinos. But I was willing to overlook that in favor of trying out their restaurants. Unfortunately, the food was not up to par. The dishes were lackluster and lacked flavor, almost like they were pre-made and reheated. The customer service was top-notch, but that couldn't make up for the disappointing experience overall. I definitely won't be returning to this casino anytime soon, as there are other local options that offer a more enjoyable gaming and dining experience."

I've been to this cigar lounge several times with high hopes, but sadly it hasn't lived up to my expectations. The drinks are consistently short-poured, leaving me feeling ripped off and unsatisfied. Despite bringing this issue to the attention of the manager multiple times, they have yet to make any changes to their stingy pouring methods. In fact, I suspect they are using some sketchy math to make sure customers get little more than an ounce of alcohol in their drinks.\n\nAnd apparently, savvy scotch and cognac drinkers have taken notice. On a recent visit, the lounge was empty and they had the audacity to issue last call at 8:45pm. Who shuts down a cigar lounge before 9pm? Needless to say, my friends and I took our business elsewhere, where we could get a decent pour of our favorite spirits at a fair price, and not be kicked out before the night is over.\n\nI had high expectations for this place, but unfortunately it seems like they don't even want to be in business. So if you do decide to give them a chance, stick to bottled beer and save your money for a better experience elsewhere."

During my last trip to Vegas, I had the chance to visit this shooting range on my way out of town. Even though there was a line, the wait was worth it as it gave me time to build anticipation for what was to come. I must say, this place felt incredibly safe. With an instructor by our side at all times and semi-isolated booths, I never once felt worried. The setup for the activity was top-notch. Each booth accommodated two couples, making it the perfect experience for groups. 

Being a fan of Call of Duty, I couldn't resist trying out the WWII special package. It included a handgun, a German machine gun, and an American Thompson machine gun. Let me tell you, the adrenaline rush I felt after the first shot with the handgun was indescribable. From there on, it was nothing but pure fun and excitement. To make things even better, my instructor was not only cool but also extremely helpful. He even took pictures of me in action.

Some may say the prices here are a bit high, but trust me, where else can you shoot machine guns? Plus, if you get the package deal, you get a slight discount on the guns, free targets, and a t-shirt as a souvenir. For an experience like this, I think it's totally worth it. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in town and try out some new weapons. Overall, this was definitely the highlight of my trip. "

I am extremely disappointed with the service we received from this moving company. We were promised same-day delivery if we verified our paychecks, but when we arrived at our new home, we were told that was not possible and we would have to wait four days. This was a huge inconvenience for us, as we had already arranged for the delivery of our furniture on that day. This is not the first time we have had issues with this company; last time they convinced us to give them another chance, but after this experience, we will never use their services again.

To make matters worse, when our furniture finally arrived, the crew made a major mistake. They brought the headboard upstairs, only to realize it was the wrong size, and had to bring it back downstairs. This is basic knowledge that any moving company should have regarding furniture sizes. It is incredibly frustrating to have to wait even longer to receive our correct headboard, and we can only hope that the rest of our furniture is the correct size and not damaged.

This moving company has proven time and time again that they are unreliable and unprofessional. We trusted them to handle our valuable belongings, and they have let us down once again. I strongly advise anyone considering using this company to look elsewhere. Save yourself the hassle and choose a more competent and trustworthy company. Our experience with this moving company has been a complete nightmare and we will never be using their services again. "
1071,"This was my first & last time going here. I went there around 9:30 (they close at 10) Not only did they seem upset my daughter and I came in they managed to mess up everything on the order to where they had to make it again. They were to busy chatting with their friends at the table behind me while I was ordering. The store was disgusting and near the soda machine you couldn't even set your cup down to put a lid on it, as the whole counter was wet with who knows what! Stay away from this location!"
1072,"Great atmosphere, small place though so during peak times I am sure you will want to have a reservation. The stuffed artichoke appetizer was amazing. They even let me order it at lunch when it isn't on the menu. Great service. The meatball hero was very good. the salad that comes with it is just ok, the balsamic house dressing is a little strong and may not be for everyone. My guest had the spaghetti and meatballs and thought it needed some garlic or oregano, something to give it some more flavor. My meatballs were covered in cheese."

My friend and I were looking for a fun and lively spot to spend New Year's Day, and decided to check out Surrender at Encore. The atmosphere was definitely hip and trendy, with people dancing and enjoying themselves. We were excited to take a break from partying and grab a few drinks at the bar.

However, things quickly took a turn when we ordered our go-to drink of Red Bull and vodka. I specifically asked for no ice, but when the bartender handed me two plastic cups filled with ice, I knew we were in for a rough night. And boy, was I right.

After receiving our receipt, I couldn't believe my eyes. We had only had two drinks, but thanks to the ridiculous prices and added service charges, we were already $50 in the hole. I couldn't help but laugh at the ""thank you"" at the bottom of the receipt, as if I was supposed to thank them for robbing me.

Honestly, the reviews for this place should come with a warning: Pre-party EXTRA HARD before stepping foot inside Surrender. Because unless you have deep pockets and don't mind spending an arm and a leg for a few drinks, this place is definitely not worth it. The only thing ""surrendering"" here is your wallet. Lesson learned, never again will I make the mistake of stopping at this overpriced and overhyped nightclub. "
1074,"Its more hype than anything. My girls and I ordered the appetizer nachos, chicken strips and the mac and cheese and were utterly disappointed in taste. We had heard a lot about this place but not only did the food take long to arrive, the taste was very bland and basic. The waiter did not come around often and just to get seated took about 30 minutes. We did order the carrot cake sundae and that was about the only thing that made the visit there kinda good. I recommend only getting what they are known for, which is their desserts. Don't bother trying their food."

""The cupcakes from this place were a hit or miss for me. I tried a variety of flavors and found that only the dark chocolate was enjoyable. The coconut cupcakes tasted like straight flour and the strawberry flavor was almost non-existent. They were heavy and dense, not the light and fluffy texture I was hoping for. To make matters worse, my friend who also tried them ended up with stomach pains afterwards. And don't even get me started on the price - I almost choked when I heard a dozen were going for such a high price. Maybe the people in this valley have forgotten what good food tastes like because I found these cupcakes to be way overhyped. But hey, maybe I'm just a pastry student with picky taste buds. However, every single person I shared these cupcakes with seemed to agree with my thoughts. Kudos to the marketing team for making these mediocre cupcakes seem like high-quality treats. Overall, I'd give these cupcakes a middle-of-the-road rating, but maybe they're just not my cup of tea."""

The wife and I recently stopped by this boba tea spot for a refreshing drink after lunch. The staff greeted us with a smile and were very accommodating. We were impressed by their wide variety of drinks on the menu. After placing our order, we waited just a few minutes before our drinks were ready. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint! Simply delicious. However, we were disappointed to find out that the option for decaf was not available. This was a problem for me as I am sensitive to caffeine. We even asked if they could make an exception, but unfortunately, they were unable to accommodate. A small issue, but enough to make us reconsider returning. Overall, a decent spot with friendly service and tasty drinks, but lacking in options for those who need caffeine-free options."

I never felt the room was all that clean and even though we had a modern renovated room, the beddings, carpet, and furnishings felt pretty run down.  For such a nice place, the toiletries were pretty disappointing, too.  None of the staff I dealt with were particularly helpful, either.  It's also pretty far down on the strip so it's a hike to get down to the center of everything.  On the plus side, they do have lots of restaurants and shops inside (and Mandalay Beach is really really awesome)."

I am extremely disappointed with the behavior of the staff and owner at this establishment. Let me explain why. Last year, the Venetian hotel signed a deal with the Rock of Ages show, which will run for the next five years. Along with the show, this bar offers a unique experience with large flat screens showing 80's hair band videos that are all synced to the music. As an 80's fan, I was excited to check out this place.

However, the excitement quickly diminished when I encountered the staff and owner. The waitresses are dressed in 80's attire and put on a short dance to the music every 45 minutes. While this may seem entertaining, these waitresses were actually hired for their dancing skills and trained to be waitresses on top of that. It's a neat concept, but it doesn't make up for the lack of integrity and respect shown by the staff and owner.

While enjoying the music and a cold drink, an MC usually walks around and interacts with the crowd. Marvelous Mark is the best MC they have, but even he couldn't make up for the terrible experience I had. When I mentioned to the owner that I had previously been promised a free wrap due to a mistake on my takeout order, he demanded proof and questioned my motivation for bringing it up. As if that wasn't bad enough, he went as far as accusing me of lying. And all of this coming from the owner of the establishment.

I was appalled by the way I was treated and made sure to let my office know to never order from this place again. I urge everyone reading this to boycott a place that clearly has no respect for their customers. As someone who frequents Vegas, I can confidently say that there are plenty of other bars that offer a much better experience. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
1079,"I came across this place after the line at Bacchanal was ridiculous. I personally love hand pulled noodles as not every Chinese restaurant offers it. I ordered Dan Dan Mian and absolutely loved it. It had the spice I was craving and the noodles were cooked perfectly.

The thing is... it's located inside Caesars Palace and not Chinatown."

This Cajun seafood spot definitely hits the spot when it comes to satisfying those spicy cravings. The atmosphere is casual and laid-back, perfect for a fun night out with friends or a casual dinner with family. Just be prepared to get a little messy, as this is not the place for a first date or important business meeting.

The menu offers a variety of seafood options, including crawfish, king crab, and shrimp, all smothered in their signature hot n juicy sauce. I highly recommend getting a pound of the mild crawfish and sharing it with a friend or partner. But be warned, even the mild option packs quite a spicy punch. If you're not a fan of heat, you may want to steer clear or opt for a milder sauce.

One downside of this spot is that they only accept cash, so make sure you come prepared. It can also get a bit pricey, but I suppose that's to be expected for a seafood joint in Vegas. However, the food is definitely worth it. We did have a bit of a mishap with the wifi disconnecting while playing the ReRave machine, but the staff quickly came to the rescue and even gave us some free games. Now that's some top-notch customer service!

Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the atmosphere was lively. Just make sure to bring some cash and an appetite for some messy, but delectable, seafood dishes. "

This restaurant definitely has a lot of potential, but our experience was kind of hit or miss. The atmosphere was lively and the staff seemed helpful and friendly. However, when we got our food, it was a little underwhelming. \n\nThe individual pizzas were a good idea, but unfortunately, the execution fell short. The piccante had too much oil and not enough peppers, which made the crust soggy. And while we enjoyed the flavor of the zucca, it definitely could have used more toppings. \n\nOn top of that, the oven seemed a little too hot, resulting in a less than ideal crust. And to make matters worse, our bill got messed up with a $15 tip added to a $40 order. Not exactly the cherry on top of a disappointing meal. \n\nOverall, while 800 degrees has a lot of potential, it fell short for us. Maybe we just caught them on an off day, but for now, we'll probably stick to other pizza places in the area."

Food: I have been a loyal patron of Panda for many years, but I must admit that the quality of service has declined lately. As someone who knows exactly how I like my plate made, I have unfortunately encountered some difficulties with the employees. I have been met with resistance and even arguments when requesting my entree to be made a certain way. And when it comes to the meat dishes, I have noticed that the portions have been filled with a disproportionate amount of vegetables. It's disappointing when I try to make a simple request for less vegetables and I am told that I will receive a smaller portion of food. It seems like the company values quantity over quality, as evidenced by the overflowing trays of food while the satisfaction of their customers is overlooked.

Service: While the service may have declined in quality, I will still give credit where it is due. Despite the arguments and resistance I have encountered, the employees have always been courteous and attentive. They do their best to refill my cup regularly and make sure all my needs are met. It's just a shame that their customer service has been overshadowed by the focus on quantity over quality.

Establishment: The establishment itself is standard for a fast food chain. It's bright, has a clean and inviting atmosphere, and is usually packed with hungry customers. I can't say much about the cleanliness of the bathroom as I have never used it, but the dining area is always spotless.

Conclusions: In conclusion, Panda is a fast food chain that seems to prioritize quantity over quality. While the food may not be made to my exact preferences and the service may have declined, the establishment itself is still comfortable and inviting. But for someone like myself who values a quality dining experience, I may have to look elsewhere for my Chinese food fix."

I had the most disappointing experience at this restaurant during my Vegas trip. From the moment we walked in, the host was incredibly rude and unwelcoming. We decided to order from the To-Go window instead and after waiting for over ten minutes, I finally received my Forbidden Sundae. But let me tell you, it was far from being a heavenly treat. Upon opening the 8-inch high plastic cup, I realized that the chocolate sauce was added at the very bottom, making it impossible to enjoy the brownie, ice cream, and whipped cream all together. It was like a game of excavation just to get a decent bite. And don't even get me started on the utensils they provided - a flimsy 6-inch spoon that was completely useless. By the time I finished, I had whipped cream and chocolate sauce all over my hands. To top it off, my friend's hot dog was a complete disaster as well. It's safe to say that we would have been happier with a McDonald's ice cream cone. The only thing that is Forbidden about this Sundae, is ever returning to this restaurant."
1084,"We were SO excited to try this place out---mainly because every Vegas guide said it was the best Thai anywhere! I think we made a mistake to go for the lunch buffet. First of all, the location is pretty weird. It's in a run-down strip mall and the entrance is in the back. Anyway, it took a LONG while to get there from the Strip as we had to take the Deuce bus and then walk for a while before we found it. So, finally we're there and we're expecting to have a religious experience. Not so. Basically, it was a regualy buffet---I didn't even think it was Thai food for the most part! So, next time we're in Vegas, we're going for dinner. Yes, I'm willing to give it another shot. Seems to me that the great reviews are based on dinner, NOT the buffet."

Wow, where do I even begin with this salon? It was an absolute disaster. I was so excited when I first walked in, the place looked cute and the staff seemed friendly. I was even able to communicate clearly with them about how I wanted my nails done. But it all went downhill from there. Less than 24 hours later, not one, not two, but three of my nails popped off like they were never even glued on properly. I was so annoyed, but I was determined to give them another chance. So I made an appointment for the next day to get it fixed. But lo and behold, two more nails had fallen off by the time my appointment rolled around. What is going on here? Three days after getting a fresh full set, I had already lost a total of five nails. It was ridiculous and definitely not worth the price I paid. I was tempted to go back for my appointment but then I realized, what's the point? If they only fixed the five that had broken off, the other five would just follow suit in a day or two. So I gave up and didn't bother going back because it simply wasn't worth the headache. It's such a shame because I really liked this salon, but their prices are far too steep for nails that can't even stay on for more than a day. Major disappointment. Needless to say, I won't be returning."
1087,"i decided to go to 24/7 only because it was the only nail salon open at the time i went however i had heard they did pretty good work. In my opinion, i highly disagree. They were in a rush to finish my nails and they are the WORST set of nails i have ever had. They were all tired from working doubles and didn't put in any effort to make my nails look good, they just wanted to hurry up and finish. I wouldn't recommend this salon to anyone and if your honestly just going because its open 24/7 it really isn't worth it. I would suggest to wait the next day and go somewhere else and not to mention there extremely expensive!!!!"

Unfortunately, my recent dining experience at this restaurant was not up to par. While the prices were reasonable, the food did not match the description. I ordered a sushi roll that claimed to be ""very spicy"", but it lacked any heat at all. The strange white sauce that was poured over my rolls was also not to my liking.

On the bright side, I did try some of my friend's dish and it was absolutely delicious. Despite my disappointment with my own order, I will likely return to give this place another chance. However, I will definitely be more cautious and ask for more details about the dishes before ordering. Hopefully, my next visit will be more satisfying."

This restaurant is truly a disappointment. I've been here twice and both times have been underwhelming. The food is barely passable and way too expensive for what you actually get. But the worst part? The atrocious service. The staff seem completely incompetent and have no sense of urgency or basic customer service skills. \n\nThe first time I went, I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and while it wasn't great, I was satisfied enough to give this place another chance. Big mistake. My second visit was a complete disaster. Not only was the food bland and overpriced, but they completely forgot one of our orders. After complaining to the manager, we were met with blank stares and unhelpful suggestions. It took over 10 minutes just to clarify our order and another 10 minutes for them to finally bring out the dish. And let's just say, it was not worth the wait. \n\nThe Spicy Tuna Roll was on another level of blandness and the Beef Bento box was reminiscent of cheap mall food. It's safe to say I will not be returning to this overrated and overpriced establishment. Save yourself the trouble and eat elsewhere. This place is a complete waste of time and money."

My family and I were looking for a new brunch spot and decided to give this place a try. Despite hearing mixed reviews, we were hopeful that we would enjoy our experience. The location was a bit out of the way and the seating options were limited, but we were willing to overlook these minor issues for the opportunity to try their famous beignets.

As expected, the beignets did not disappoint. They were warm, fluffy, and perfectly dusted with powdered sugar. It was like biting into a little piece of heaven. However, the rest of the meal was just average. Although we heard great things about the main courses, we found them to be lackluster and overpriced.

The service was friendly and attentive, but a bit overenthusiastic. Maybe they were trying to make up for the underwhelming food? We tried their signature cocktails and wine pairings, but found them to be nothing special. However, the real letdown came with the desserts. The flavors were just okay and not worth the indulgence.

Overall, it was a decent dining experience, but not worth the hype. I will say, though, that the beignets alone are worth the trip. But just be cautious, because you might find yourself craving them constantly and unable to resist the temptation. "

Overall, my recent experience at this Asian buffet was disappointing. I came in with high hopes after reading all the positive reviews, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations.

First of all, the sushi selection was very limited and the quality was subpar. I could tell that it had been sitting out for a while and there was no sushi chef in sight. It was not fresh at all. I was also disappointed to see that the food in the buffet area was not up to par either. The flavors were bland and some dishes were even cold.

I had been to this buffet before and had a much better experience, but this visit was just terrible. From the stale sushi to the unappetizing buffet items, I left feeling unsatisfied and regretting my decision to come here.

On a positive note, the service was good and the staff was friendly. But unfortunately, good service cannot make up for the poor quality of the food.

I used to highly recommend this place, especially to those who enjoy sushi. But after my most recent visit, I will not be returning. I hope they can improve their food quality and avoid falling into the trap of becoming just another mediocre buffet. Until then, I will be looking for other options in the area."
1092,"I came here for lunch and ordered a salad with steak on it.  The steak was blah and there was hardley any of it on the salad.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  So I ordered the chicken cesear salad...that was the most bland salad I've ever had. You know how there's supposed to be that slight twang of lemon there was none.  The chicken was so bland and chewy it was very difficult to eat.  There was no seasoning on the chicken whatsoever.  I'm thinking it was some left over chicken from somewhere.  Needless to say I left there hungry.  \n\nMy lesson learned...when you go to a bar, order bar food.  You should have better luck with the wings."
1093,"NOTE: The restaurant is located right off I-60 on your right hand side, so make sure to turn into that first plaza, so that you don't miss it! \n\nI came here on a Saturday around 11 am, and a table for 2 was about a 15 minute wait. The restaurant is very cozy and cute, and the staff is great, full of smiles and very nice. My boyfriend and I ordered:\n\n1) Crab Stuffed Pastry Benedict + Potatoes - The core is imitation crab with artichoke hearts on a crispy pastry, almost like a toasted croissant taste. Then, the whole thing is topped by a poached egg and plentiful hollendaise sauce. The sauce is definitely the best part of the dish. I don't care too much for imitation crab, especially if the dish costs ~$12 (quite pricey for imitation, in my opinion). The potatoes were eh. and there wasn't very much of them.\n\n2) Eggs Benedict + Fruit  - DO NOT GET FRUIT as a side, because it literally came \nwith 2 pieces of orange and 2 small slices of honeydew. Not much of a fruit salad. This was the standard eggs benedict, poached egg over canadian bacon (which was cooked well), and english muffin. The hollendaise sauce was again the star of the show, and smothered all over the plate (hopefully, you like the sauce as much as I did, otherwise it would be too overwhelming)\n\n3) Side Fruit Salad - grapes, kiwi, apples, honeydew, canteloupe, watermelon - now that's a real side fruit salad.\n\nOverall, the food is okay, but the service is great. I'll probably try an omelette next time."
1094,"To give you an impression of how good this \""steak\"" restaurant is...I ordered the pork.  I was here with a couple of buddies and we were all hopeful for a spectacular meal. \nMind you the food wasn't horrible, but the experience of a steak house was completely null and void. If I wanted food court atmosphere and noise, I would have opted for the McDonald's McRib and saved myself $130.  \nAdditionally, when I sit down at a famous chefs restaurant, make sure I don't have the capability to make better side dishes or steaks (from what I gather none of the guys who had steak enjoyed it) at home. And for the prices that are charged, offering me a 'french fry' sampler 'compliments of the house' was pretty tacky...don't give ketchup a fancy name in the hopes I'd never had ketchup before and didn't know what it tasted like. \nOh, and pay no attention to the dress code because the staff doesn't. You could easily wear a basketball jersey at the bar and if you show up at just the right time, they let you wear basketball shorts and t-shirts to dine there. Really fancied up the place....\nAt least the waiter was nice...I guess it makes a up for everything else, right? no."

The bar was a huge disappointment overall. Despite the cozy atmosphere and good selection of drinks, the service was subpar. We arrived to find all the tables taken and had to squeeze into a corner with no chairs. Despite this, we decided to stay and grab some food. However, after seeing other patrons' plates, we were quickly put off by the overpowering smells and greasy appearance of the food. We ended up just ordering drinks, which were decent but overly expensive. Maybe it's because we weren't regulars, but the bartender seemed disinterested in serving us and we had to wait a long time for our drinks. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this bar to anyone. Save your money and go somewhere else for a better experience. "
1096,"Like others have said,  food was good but the service was slow.  Chips were average but the salsa was good.  I had an enchillada plate and cleaned up everything on my plate.  Perfect size portion IMO.  Bar area has 3-4 large TVs.  Good place to watch a game, play some billards or catch happy hour,  but this probably wouldnt be a good \""date\"" restuarant."
1097,"I am the husband that Linda refers to in the 1st review, I CANNOT express how VERY disappointed I am in Estrella Animal Hospital and have certainly spread the word as to their lack of attention and compassion at a time of real need.  We used to bring them 6 clients... yes 6, but now it will be ZERO based on this unfortunate discision made by them on a Friday.  Would any other \""hospital\"" turn away a potential dying patient?  I hate to think what would have happened had we shown up without calling first."

I've been to a lot of pizza places around Madison, and I have to say that this one really stood out to me. The pizza was light, yet packed with so much flavor. I could tell that the ingredients were high quality and fresh, making each bite incredibly enjoyable. And let me tell you, the portions were just perfect - enough for one person to thoroughly savor without feeling like you need to roll out of the restaurant afterwards. 

As a bonus, I was able to take advantage of a check in deal and try their signature margarita pizza. Let me just say, it was simply the best! The perfect blend of dough, sauce, and cheese - it was truly a pizza lover's dream. 

However, my experience wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. The service was a bit hit or miss. At times, the waitstaff was attentive and checked on us frequently, but then there were periods of neglect. And the biggest disappointment was the waiting time for our food. Despite not being too busy, the wait was longer than expected. 

All in all, this place was alright. While their pizza was definitely a standout, the service and wait time left a bit to be desired. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back, but I wouldn't refuse if a friend suggested it."

I stopped by Trader Joe's on a whim after hearing so many rave reviews about their wine selection. While I came for the wine, I couldn't help but check out their other offerings. The produce was decently priced and the flowers caught my eye, but let's be real, I was there for the wine. And let me tell you, they did not disappoint.

I was able to find a variety of great red wines for under 6 bucks, which made my daily wine habit a lot more affordable. But the real standout was their Big Day White, with a quirky label featuring a walking pancake. I'm usually more of a red wine person, but this white completely won me over. It was crisp, refreshing, and had a unique flavor that I couldn't get enough of. I even bought a bottle for my mom, who usually sticks to her beloved white zinfandel, and she was also blown away.

While the wine selection is what brings me to Trader Joe's, I can appreciate their other offerings as well. However, I can also see how people may find the store a bit overwhelming or lacking in certain areas. But for me, as long as I can get my hands on their affordable and delicious wines, I'll always be a happy customer."
1100,"What a bad day to try Fate. I've been wanting to check it out for a long time. I was excited to have my cheat meal and try their beers. We show up and a notice on the door says the kitchen is closed due to their refrigerators being broken. Bummer and unfortunate for them. I had come on an empty stomach, planning to eat and drink. Now I'm in a bit of trouble. Luckily my boyfriend had eaten and could drive home. We asked if we could get se food and bring it in since they couldn't serve and we were drinking after all. The answer was a stern no with a bunch of BS added to it. You would think the liability of serving people without food would override having others food in your establishment. Guess not. \n\nThen there were three guys at the end of the bar. They were three of five in the place. You would think they were hard of hearing the way they were practically yelling at each other to have a conversation. Annoying. We took out tasting flights and moved to a table. \n\nAnother couple came in and were so annoyed by the loud patrons they asked that the music be turned up to drown them out. \n\nOveralls not a welcoming experience. Trying to take into account what is their fault and what isn't but the customer service was no bueno and that goes a long way. \n\nMaybe we'll try it again some time...maybe."

My experience here was an absolute nightmare. I had been looking forward to a nice outdoor lunch with my husband, but this place ruined that entirely. From the moment we walked in, the staff was rude and unaccommodating. We wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather, but were met with an eye roll and a huff from the hostess. And don't even get me started on the food. The calamari was the only decent thing we had, everything else was either overcooked or tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. But the real cherry on top was when we received our bill. The prices were outrageous and when we questioned them, the server was incredibly dismissive and downright rude. No apologies, no attempt to make things right, just a cold, uncaring attitude. This place is clearly only concerned with making a profit, not providing good service or quality food. Save yourselves the trouble and find somewhere else to spend your money. Horrendous."

The Lobster Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. As an Italian food enthusiast and frequent diner at high-end restaurants, I have high standards for my food. The flavors were bland and the lobster was overcooked. The Buffalo Wings and Buffalo Chicken Dip were the saving grace, with their perfect balance of spice and creaminess. However, this was just the appetizer menu. As I moved on to the main course, I was disappointed once again. The Gold Standard burger, while visually appealing, lacked flavor and the Nom Nom burger was underwhelming. The steak cut fries, though crisp, were nothing out of the ordinary. I found myself wishing for more generous portions and a wider selection on the menu. But don't get me wrong, the atmosphere and customer service were top-notch. I couldn't help but tap my feet along to the live music. In the end, I might just stop by for a drink at the bar and to soak in the old-fashioned tunes of Frank Sinatra. This place has a lot of potential, but it fell short in terms of food."
1103,Forced to stay here because of convenience to the convention center and couldn't get a room at the Mandalay Bay.  It's been probably 10 years since stepping foot in the Luxor.  I am unimpressed.  The place just seems dirty and old.  This place needs a major renovation or just tear it down.  The elevator walls are peeling and tarnished.  Pyramid Deluxe rooms are dark.  There's been a glass sitting at the at the foot of my door since the day I checked in and it's still not been taken away.  I can say I will never be back here again.

The service at this place was beyond terrible. We were rushed to make an order because apparently the kitchen was closing, even though the sign clearly stated they were open for another 30 minutes. As if that wasn't bad enough, we were served our food as it was prepared, which meant some of us were stuck uncomfortably munching on our dishes while others waited for their orders. And to top it off, some of the things we had ordered never even showed up. When we asked our waiter about it, their response was beyond rude, as if they couldn't be bothered by our concerns. But the cherry on top was when we discovered that our food was actually pretty good, so it was just a shame that it was overshadowed by the horrendous service. I've dined at a lot of places, and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had. The staff clearly has no respect for their customers, and it's not worth putting up with for decent food. Save your money and go elsewhere. "

I recently stopped by this place on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised by the food. The Hungry Hippie burrito, with tater tots inside, was surprisingly delicious! I never would have thought to put those two things together, but somehow they just work. My husband had the High Roller, and he was very satisfied with the quality of the steak and bacon. Speaking of bacon, it was definitely the real deal and not the cheap stuff you usually find in restaurants. And let's talk about the salsa - it was chunky, but in a good way. It had a nice kick to it without completely ruining the taste buds. The space is a bit small, but apparently they offer delivery, so that's a plus. And the fact that they stay open late is also a huge bonus in my book. Overall, the food was pretty good and I would probably come back here if I'm ever in the area again. However, I do have to mention that the prices were a bit steep for what you get. But hey, sometimes you have to pay a little more for good food, right?"

I was excited to try Laurie Raphael, as I had heard great things about their food. And I have to say, the food did not disappoint. The flavors were spot-on and the bread was incredibly fresh. The service was also top-notch, with the staff being extremely knowledgeable about the menu.

But I have to be honest, the prices at this place are astronomical. I'm used to paying for quality dining experiences, but Laurie Raphael takes it to a whole new level. The only option for two people is an all-inclusive menu that will set you back almost $200. And if you're choosing from the tapas menu, be prepared to pay around $20-$25 per dish. That's already pricey, but then my girlfriend ordered a cocktail that cost a whopping $26. That's just ridiculous.

While the food and service were great, I couldn't help but feel a bit overcharged by the end of the meal. It's a shame because I did enjoy my dining experience, but the overly inflated prices took away from it. I know there are plenty of other amazing restaurants out there where I can get the same quality food for a fraction of the cost. So while I may recommend Laurie Raphael to someone who doesn't mind splurging, I personally won't be returning."
1107,"This place has got to be kidding.  I specifically drove to the location and explained that I did not the standard rectangle like shaped beef in my beef and onions.  I asked was the beef fresh, not frozen and did they get it frozen and processed.  The lady lied directly to my face and told me that they only have non frozen, fresh meats.  I got home and was horrified and not only that but the fried chicken wings (also frozen but expected) were actually \""horribly spoiled\""  I mean these wings after frying were GREEN in color!  I called back immediately and they sent another batch over to my home down the street and these wings were so small you would need a magnifier to see them; moreover, THEY WERE BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION AND BLACK.  I called again and this same lady told me that they were going to tell the company where they ordered the product that it was bad!  Not my problem as a customer and she actually tried to sell me other food with more lies.  Last time I go back there.  I also noticed someone wipe their nose and commence with handling food in the kitchen right before my very eyes.  Just Nasty!"

Although I had a satisfying meal at this restaurant, I couldn't help but notice the poor filter system in place.

I didn't realize the extent of the issue until I left the restaurant and noticed how much better my nose and lungs felt. Unfortunately, I've been home for a few days now and my respiratory health is still struggling. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere, but the air quality is simply unacceptable. I won't be returning until they do something to improve it."

I was eager to try out Beauty Bar after purchasing a Groupon for dramatic eyelashes. I had high hopes, as I've been getting extensions since 2009 and have always been pleased with my previous experiences. However, my visit to Beauty Bar left me feeling disappointed. 
Despite the promise of ""dramatic"" lashes, the ones I received were all the same length and lacked the fullness I was expecting. In fact, they were so sparse that it almost looked like I was missing lashes. I ended up soaking them off, as I felt more confident with my natural lashes or even just using mascara. 
I really wanted to like this place and find a new go-to spot for lash extensions, especially since it's conveniently located in my area. But after this experience, I'm not sure I'll be returning. The Groupon may have been a great deal, but the lackluster results and the time and effort it took to remove them made it not worth it in the end. 
I hate to leave a negative review, but as someone who has worked in the beauty industry, I have high standards for service and quality. Unfortunately, Beauty Bar fell short on both fronts. From the unimpressive lashes to the overall experience, I left feeling disappointed and let down. Perhaps it was just an off day, but I'll be exploring other options for my lash needs before considering returning."

The sushi here at this restaurant is decent overall. However, the pricing is a bit tricky. The all-you-can-eat option is definitely the best deal, but the individual prices for certain items may seem a little high. Take, for example, the shrimp tempura, green dragon roll, and tuna sushi - they are definitely worth it, in my opinion. But be warned, if you're not looking to stuff yourself with sushi, you might want to skip this place altogether. It's definitely a spot for sushi lovers who are ready to indulge. And hey, at least they allow you to bring your own wine to help balance out the cost. Service-wise, it's not the best, but let's be honest, that's par for the course at all-you-can-eat sushi joints. If only the sushi could be as tasty as that pollo mole dish I heard about from a friend. Overall, I might come back again, but only if someone else is footing the bill. "

This place is an absolute rip-off. My friend dragged me here for a pedicure and I was not impressed. First of all, the chair I sat in was broken and kept making loud, annoying noises the entire time I was there. The staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than actually giving proper services. I asked for a simple nail polish change, and they ended up cutting my cuticles and using a shade that I specifically said I did not want. And when I asked them to fix it, they gave me attitude and charged me extra. The whole experience was a disaster. To top it off, they only served cheap, fast food-style snacks and canned soda. I mean, if I wanted that kind of experience, I could have just gone to a cheap salon down the street. Save your money and go somewhere else for a relaxing and actually decent pedicure."
1112,"Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and pork egg rolls.  I was really hungry so it hit the spot, but there wasn't that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken - a lot of peanuts (as expected) and a whole lot of celery and carrots (aka filler).  So I was a bit disappointed in that.  \n\nThe steam dumplings were good, especially when fresh and hot.  The egg roll was tasty as well - I didn't find it too oily.  Very affordable and a generous portion - I had the leftovers the next day."

First off, let me say that I am NOT a picky eater by any means. I've worked in the food industry myself, so I understand the ins and outs of serving and customer service. However, my experience at this place was less than satisfactory.

As I walked in alone to pick up some dinner for myself, I was greeted promptly but soon found myself ignored as the woman behind the counter prioritized a phone call and her personal tasks over taking my order. After finally placing my order for the famous curry chicken with roti, I settled in to wait for my meal.

But as I waited, I couldn't help but notice the portion size of the curry chicken. It was more like a small appetizer than a main dish, and upon further inspection, I saw that it was listed as an appetizer on the menu. Yet, I was still charged $4.95 for what amounted to mostly potatoes and a small amount of chicken.

As if that wasn't enough, the woman behind the counter seemed more interested in her phone and organizing her business cards than attending to her customers. I watched as she chatted away while I waited for my food, and when I finally got her attention to pay and leave, she quickly resumed her phone call without so much as a thank you or have a nice day.

Needless to say, I will not be returning to this place. If the service is this lacking with only two customers in the restaurant, I can't even imagine what it would be like during a busy hour. And as for dessert, I'll just stick with a McFlurry from McDonald's next time. Trust me, it's better for both my taste buds and my wallet. "

I recently visited Zink for the first time and was initially drawn in by its prime location in Uptown Charlotte. The restaurant has a cool and swanky vibe, almost like you're in a big city like New York or Miami. There were lots of young and attractive people, creating a lively atmosphere. However, my experience at Zink fell short in terms of the food. \n\nI ordered their burgers, which are supposedly their specialty, and was disappointed. They were just okay, nothing special. My girlfriend, on the other hand, enjoyed her sushi from their surprisingly diverse menu. However, the diversity of options may be the restaurant's downfall. With such a wide range of dishes, it's difficult to excel in all of them. \n\nThe drinks were good, but not good enough to make up for the subpar food. It's a great place to grab a drink and socialize, but it's definitely not a spot I would pick for a nice dinner. Overall, I was underwhelmed by my dining experience at Zink and probably won't be returning. The atmosphere and location are the only redeeming qualities of this place."

I stopped by this place after a long morning of running errands, craving a hearty breakfast sandwich. The reviews I read raved about the bagel sandwiches, so I was excited to try one. Well, let me tell you, I was not impressed. I ordered the black forest ham, egg & cheese sandwich on a wheat bagel, and the first thing I noticed was the lack of flavor. I mean, I couldn't taste the ham or the egg at all! The bagel itself was also pretty bland, and I was disappointed that it didn't add any extra flavor to the sandwich. On the other hand, I did try a bite of my son's pretzel bagel with schmear, and that was actually pretty good. But beware, it was so salty, I had to scrape some of it off. So, if you're in the mood for a bagel and schmear, this place is decent. But if you're looking for a satisfying bagel sandwich, I'd say go elsewhere. Overall, our experience here was just okay, and I don't think I'll be back anytime soon unless I'm craving a simple bagel fix. "

1117,"Check your food before you leave the drive-up!!!\nI've been going to this restaurant regularly for over 5 years and can count on one hand how many times they have gotten my order right.  This is the only restaurant I've ever frequented that I have to literally open up the bag, pull out by burrito, unwrap it, and peel open the tortilla to MAKE SURE it is what right!  Unfortunately, they make it wrong 90% of the time and end up having to make it again.  You would think a small business would get tired of throwing away food because it was made incorrectly, but you would be WRONG.  On one occasion I didn't  check it before driving home and found out it was wrong so I drove all the way back to have it made correctly;  they made it again and STILL SCREWED UP MY ORDER!  \nThe food is very good and a decent value.  However, the frustration of dozens and dozens of screwed up orders, coupled with a very dangerous location where you are approached by panhandlers WHILE WAITING IN YOUR CAR in the drive-up, has left me as an ex-customer of Armandos.  Never again will they screw up burrito!  Is it really rocket science to make a frickin' burrito with ONLY CARNE ASADA AND CHEESE AND NOTHING ELSE???"
1118,"My husband and I along with our children, flew in from another country to spend our last week with our oldest son who will be leaving for boot camp with the US marines shortly. We rented a van (only my husband was registered to drive) and drove over an hour to the salt river recreation park on July 17 2014 at 12:50 pm. The plan was that he would drop off my 11 yr old daughter, 17 yr old son along with myself and pick us up at 7 pm.  Upon arrival we were informed that because my husband and six yr old brought us and stepped foot on their property we would not be allowed to tube. We stated that my daughter and husband were only dropping us off as we rented the van that only he could drive,  but the senior staff rudely informed us that this was their policy  and they were not going to change it. They were completely heartless, rude and offered no apology for the fact that their website had no mention of this policy. We will never know what fun we could have had but were very disappointed with the staffs response. At no place on their web site does it state that tubers will be denied if they are dropped off or have someone under 8 yrs old in their car on their property. Yes we knew she could not tube and had no plans of even having her stay. The staff were completely unworkable and even admitted that this is not stated anywhere on their web site. As bad as this is I would have appreciated them saying,\"" We are sorry you drove all this way but come back tomorrow and ask for me and I will give you a deal as this was not your fault.\"" This would have been true customer service even in a hard situation."

Unfortunately, our experience at this restaurant was far from satisfactory. As we arrived, we were quickly seated without having to wait, which seemed like a positive sign. However, our high hopes were quickly diminished when we were bombarded with a slew of dishes that were far too rich and heavy for a brunch meal. It's safe to say that our stomachs were not too pleased with the amount of food we consumed.

But the biggest disappointment of all was the subpar service we received. While the food itself was impressive, the same couldn't be said for the staff. They seemed to be in a rush to get us in and out as fast as possible, possibly to clear the table for other customers. We were even pressured to select our wine quickly, and before we even finished our starters, our plates were swiftly taken away without asking if we were done.

The rushed and impersonal atmosphere put a damper on the rest of our dining experience. The food, which had potential to be excellent, could not be fully enjoyed due to the constant feeling of being hurried. It's a shame that a restaurant with such promise falls short in terms of service. Perhaps they should take some notes from other Charlie Palmer restaurants or even the highly praised Aureole in NY.

Overall, while the food was good, it could have been so much better if we were given the time to actually enjoy it. Unfortunately, due to the rushed service and lack of attention to our needs, we cannot recommend this restaurant. It's a shame that our brunch was tarnished by such poor service. Maybe with some improvements and a slower pace, this place could reach its full potential."
1120,"I love Cold Stone.  I've been patronizing them since they were just starting up.  Now they are a huge corporation and sometimes I have a hard time going because of it.  The one thing that makes it easy to not go is the AZ Center location.\n\nThis Cold Stone is staffed by the laziest, rudest, worst employees ever.  Most Cold Stones get a bit chaotic because employees are running around trying to get through the line of customers.  Not at AZ Center.  They operate in slow motion, if they operate in any kind of motion at all.  There are always 4 or 5 employees working but almost all of them are in the back.  The one out front does all of the work and usually takes a break between customers to go into the back to txt someone.  Asking for anything beyond a simple scoop of ice cream is turned into a chore by these kids.  Don't you dare ask for a smoothie or something that requires them to \""go get something from the back\"" because you may never see them again.  \n\nThe girls that work here all have 6 inch fake nails and the boys all have tear-drop tattoos under their eyes.  It is a wonder that management doesn't fire them all but, after seeing a manager, I realize that this business is simply a front for either prostitution or dealing drugs."

The Sunday brunch at this place was quite the experience. Walking into this grand establishment, I felt like I was transported back in time to the era of old money elites. The decor and ambiance were stunning, and the abundance of beautiful people added to the overall elegant atmosphere. However, the food was just okay. Don't get me wrong, the buffet was fantastic, with a delicious spread of seafood, appetizers, and desserts. But the entrees were nothing to write home about. I found myself longing for more flavor and creativity in my dish. Plus, the drinks were ridiculously expensive. But hey, you're at the Biltmore, so I guess it's to be expected. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, although at times he came off as a bit snooty. But I guess that's expected when you're dining at a place as posh as this. On a positive note, the salmon was the star of the meal. It was cooked to perfection and had me reaching for my napkin to wipe the drool from my mouth. I only wish I had skipped my chosen entree and went straight for the salmon. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the dessert. It was a major disappointment, with my apple cake tasting stale and unappetizing. I hope it was just an off day for the pastry chef. Overall, I give this place three stars. The atmosphere and buffet were fantastic, but the entree and dessert left much to be desired. I might come back for the salmon, assuming they still have it on the menu. And who knows? Maybe the fourth time will be the charm for my dessert. Woof!"

My friend and I recently stayed at this hotel for a quick getaway in November. I have to say, we weren't expecting much since we got such a great deal, but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rooms. They were clean, spacious, and had all the amenities we needed for a comfortable stay. However, we were unfortunate enough to have a room that faced the Trump casino, which was a bit of a disappointment. On the bright side, we were able to have a low-key Vegas experience, as the casino was just a short walk away.

As for the hotel's on-site restaurant, the food was decent but nothing to write home about. It was your typical buffet-style Chinese food, good enough to fill our stomachs but not spectacular by any means. One thing we did appreciate was that the staff was quick to refill our drinks as soon as they were empty, which was a nice touch.

Now, let's talk about the bathrooms. Or should I say, let's not talk about them. They were in dire need of some serious cleaning. It was quite disappointing to see such a lack of attention to cleanliness in an otherwise decent hotel. But hey, at least we had the doughnuts! We were lucky enough to grab some fresh ones when they first came out, and boy were they delicious! They were definitely the highlight of our stay.

Overall, this hotel was alright. It had its positives and negatives, but for the price we paid, we can't complain too much. If you're on a budget and looking to have a low-key Vegas trip, this might be a good option for you. Just make sure to skip the bathrooms and grab some doughnuts!"

I came here with my friends for a bachelor party weekend in Vegas and let me tell you, we were not disappointed. The energy inside was electric and the decor was out of this world. It was clear that this place was a popular spot, as there was a long line to get in. Luckily, we had made reservations in advance and were able to bypass the line and head straight to our table in the mezzanine. From there, we had a perfect view of the dance floor and the lively crowd below.

The DJ, who's name I can't recall, was killing it all night long. He played a great mix of music that kept everyone on their feet. And speaking of feet, mine were definitely sore the next day from all the dancing we did. We didn't even bother looking at the bill, as we were having such a good time and didn't want to spoil the moment. But I will say, our drinks were a bit pricey, but that's to be expected at a popular Vegas spot.

The only downside of the night was trying to get outdoor seating. It seemed to be a popular request, so we weren't able to snag a table outside. Nevertheless, we still had a great time inside and the staff were friendly and attentive despite how busy it was. Overall, I would definitely recommend checking out this place when in Vegas, whether it's for a bachelor party or just a fun night out with friends. The atmosphere and music are definitely worth experiencing. "
1124,"My wife and I waited for a while to be seated despite several tables being open and cleaned. The regulars, who came in several minutes after us, are catered to by the staff (several parties were seated as we were but their tables had chips and salsa already waiting and they received their service at the same time we did). The food itself was good but lacked spice. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either. It is just an OK place to eat. Next time we'll drive a few more miles."
1125,"Not what I expected at all.  There are three great parts to my experience at Fleming's; the service, the atmosphere, and the drinks.  We came here for  restaurant week for a group of 4. Now I understand restaurant week you try to dumb the menu, which I knew before hand.  I ordered an uptown Manhattan which was probably one of the best drinks I have had in the area. Our server was quick, attentive, and even helped snag an extra chair for a guest we didn't know that was coming.  The ambience is dimly light (fake candles though) and very romantic/modern.  The bar area even looked nice to grab a few drinks.  \n\nSo next we get our food orders.  We started with an appetizer of sweet chile calamari which I was overall impressed with.  Crispy, chewy, and the sweet chile taste was great and not overbearing.  The salad came next and nothing to thrilling, just a bag of lettuce dropped on my plate.  I didn't care about that I was waiting for the steak.  So while ordering my steak I asked for it to be cooked medium and inquired about what side there would be.  There was no side, but I could upgrade to a side of asparagus for $10. Really?  $10 for a couple pieces of asparagus.  So we decided to order sides \""family style\"" which just meant a normal sized side where everyone got a teaspoon worth. Whatever, I didn't care bring on the STEAK!  So here it comes magically floating in my waiter's hand only to be magically going into my box at the end of the night.  I ended up donating this box to a homeless person ( duck voice guy).  The steak was the equivalent of what you would receive at a wedding, It was brown in the middle and cooked more to the tune of medium-well.  The taste just wasn't there.  Finally, they topped it off a tiny square of cheesecake which I would have preferred a small slice compared to this tiny portion.\n\nI totally expected more from a place like this.  I understand it is restaurant week, but this did not do anything to win me over.  I actually would have been happy if just the steak was good, but daaaaaaaaaaaamn comes to my mind when thinking about it.  $85 for a terrible steak, an appetizer, and two manhattans.  I am pretty sure I could have went to another steakhouse such as Sullivan's and  spent the same price while receiving a Grade A steak.  Unfortunately I won't go back here for client meetings or dates.  I wonder if the homeless guy even chucked my steak in the trash."
1126,"this is a review from during their 1st year\n\ni visited the village right before the grand opening in 2012. i was excited to see something really awesome. did it met my expectations? yes and no\n\nyes because the sculptures were something to behold even though the chapel wasn't done when i was there. went through each room and looked at the details they put in. that was the interesting part\n\nno because besides looking at rooms and maybe paying for a night, there was nothing else to do. they had a restaurant as well as a bar but outside of those, no activities whatsoever. i'm not the kind of person who'll stand there, drink in hand and talk. if i'm going to do that, i prefer in a warmer cozier place\n\nthey decided to not open for the 2014 season because of a lack of funding. they may never open again. the premise of the village is great but the execution is lacking. it needs activities to attract the crowd or at least, get them to come back. not a lot of people enjoy freezing their butt off\n\nhopefully, they'll get the necessary funding so they can re-open and continue to offer something interesting during winter but i hope that they'll offer more than just a drink with a side of butt freezing"

That response does not encourage me to give your establishment another chance."

Betty convinced me to check out XS and I have to say, it was the worst club experience I've ever had. The ambiance was tacky and overcrowded, with creepy guys and catty girls everywhere. And don't even get me started on the prices - cover charge was through the roof, and drinks were insanely expensive. When we finally got inside, we couldn't even enjoy ourselves because of how crowded it was. And to top it all off, some people were actually jumping in the pool! Gross. Save yourself the time and money and go somewhere else. Trust me, you're not missing anything special at XS."

So, I know this isn't exactly a fancy dining experience, but let me tell you, this Jack in the Box location exceeded our expectations. We ended up here not once, but twice during our trip to Phoenix.

The first time was late at night, after a long day of travel and our flight being delayed. We were exhausted and hungry, and when we saw that the drive-thru was open, we were thrilled. But since we didn't have a car, we went to the front entrance which was just being locked by the employees. However, one kind woman noticed us and let us in to place our order. Talk about great customer service!

And then, four nights later, after attending the All-Star Game, our hunger hit again and we made our way back to JITB. Again, they were just closing up, but the staff recognized us as the ""lame Californians without a car"" and let us in once more.

Sure, the food was typical JITB fare, but there's just something about that Sprite that hits the spot in that 101 degree heat. Plus, the friendly and accommodating staff truly made our experience at this JITB location memorable. Who knew fast food could have such great service? Definitely worth recommending to anyone looking for a quick bite in Phoenix!"

On a recent road trip, my family and I stumbled upon this quaint little diner called Willy and Jose's. We were originally heading to another restaurant but unfortunately they were only open for dinner. So we decided to give Town Talk II a chance and we were pleasantly surprised!

The servers were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making us feel right at home. Despite there not being many servers on duty, our waitress made sure to try her best to attend to all her tables. The service was a little slow but we didn't mind as we were enjoying the lively atmosphere of the restaurant.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw while my wife opted for a half club sandwich and salad. The pulled pork sandwich was definitely the highlight of our meal, with the tender pork and fulfilling coleslaw. My wife also thoroughly enjoyed her half club sandwich and salad. Overall, the food was good but not exceptional.

We did notice that the restaurant was quite popular among the St. Mary's football crowd and we could see why. The family-style feel and bustling environment added to the charm of this diner. However, some dishes fell a little short of our expectations, such as the ribs.

Although it may not be the best BBQ we've ever had, it's certainly not the worst. And the outstanding service and friendly atmosphere made our dining experience worth it. Plus, the cabbage side dish was so delicious, we would definitely drive the 10 miles again just for that! Despite not being our original intention, we ended up enjoying our meal at Town Talk II."
1131,"We drove thirty minutes tonight to check this place out. Unfortunately, a gentleman greeted us and a few other customers by saying, \""our fryer cook went home. The oil is too full and I had to turn it off\"". We were not able to get any donuts. I totally understand safety comes first but I would assume he would have at least passed out coupons or vouchers to come back. I'd still love to check this place out but am disappointed in the customer service."

I recently had the privilege of dining at Chicago Joe's for a wedding party with some friends. My best friend had found this place on Yelp and we were all excited to try it out. At first, I was impressed with the valet and the hostess who warmly greeted us. However, things started to go downhill from there. Our group of 22 quickly outgrew the restaurant's small size and we were cramped in our seating arrangements. I also ended up with a different waitress than the one who initially took our order. As a first-timer at restaurant week, I had some questions but unfortunately, they were not answered to my satisfaction. 

Moving on to the food, my starter was missing the traditional bread that usually comes with the meal and I wasn't given an explanation for it. This was quite disappointing. Then, when I tried to order the lamb chop trio, I was informed that it was no longer available. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it standard for the chef to inform the staff when a dish is no longer available? I settled for the lemon pepper chicken instead and while it was delicious, it wasn't what I had initially wanted. 

Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, I was disappointed yet again when the dessert I ordered was not what was listed on the menu. I reluctantly settled for a substitute and when it arrived, I made a point to mention that I didn't want the berries that garnished the top. The waitress offered to bring me an additional slice of cheesecake but since then, I could sense her attitude towards me had changed. It felt as though she assumed I wouldn't be tipping, and when I left my usual 20% tip, her demeanor changed drastically. 

But the real kicker was when I got home and realized that my dessert was actually the original one, with the berries removed. This gave me the impression that I was treated as a ""second class citizen"" simply because I ordered the restaurant week menu. The cherry on top was the overpriced bill. Overall, my experience at Chicago Joe's left a bad taste in my mouth. While the food was decent, it was definitely not worth the high prices and the lackluster service. I won't be returning anytime soon."
1134,"I have a gift certificate for an Ultimate Makeover - 2 1/2 hours of consultation, cut, color, style and makeup.  I was really excited to try the Spa and in desperate need of a haircut so I called right away to make an appointment. I was lucky enough that the first available appointment, although 2 weeks away was on a Friday night.  I booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really, how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out.) Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF? You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?\n\nI swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?\n\nHonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.\n\nTo be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.  I will update after I have my service, hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation."
1135,Stayed at GN for a weekend visit with my GF.  This hotel is terrible with even worse service. They advertise free valet but we could not get in as they were full And ended up parking in Bridger St lot 3 blocks away. Management just gave us some lame excuse but no real help. The room was nice but slightly dated. No refrigerator microwave. And the room was not really clean.  We found dirty clothes in the couch cushions. Also got charged a Fremont charge. Would not stay here again.

The costumes and sets were impressive, but unfortunately, that was the highlight of the show. As a longtime fan of Cirgue Du Soleil, I was disappointed by the lack of true circus acts. Instead, the majority of the performance consisted of dancing and some martial arts. I found myself nodding off multiple times during the show. And don't get me started on the final scene, where they simply played a video. I understand that one of the performers died last year, but that does not excuse such a lackluster finale. It felt more like a standard play than a Cirgue Du Soleil production. I've heard rave reviews from people who saw this show years ago, but I certainly didn't experience the same level of excitement. I was expecting to be dazzled and entertained, but instead, I left feeling underwhelmed. To top it off, the show was overpriced for what it delivered. Save your money and find a different Cirgue Du Soleil show with a more traditional circus experience. This one just didn't live up to the hype.

On the other hand, my recent visit to the park for the Ice Cream Festival was absolutely amazing. The park's gardens and museum are not only beautiful but also educational. It's the perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of Vegas and immerse yourself in nature. I loved exploring the bike and hiking trails, and the fact that bikes are available for rent makes it accessible for everyone. The staff were all incredibly friendly and helpful, adding to the overall positive experience. I would highly recommend this place for a fun and educational day out. Plus, who doesn't love ice cream? Overall, a fantastic place to visit for all ages."

1138,A tourist trap where location may be the only thing to recommend it.   Food at a level lower than a chain Italian and service was completely absent minded.

The atmosphere at this restaurant is fantastic - it's one of the main reasons we keep coming back. The service is usually on point and the food is great for the prices. However, there's one thing that keeps taking away from the overall experience, and that's the wait staff constantly congregating in the bar area. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I know that this is not allowed and it can make for an uncomfortable dining experience. On multiple occasions, we have witnessed the staff being very loud and rowdy, even bringing a baby into the bar area. We ended up leaving or going to a different place because we just wanted a relaxing evening without all the chaos. It's a shame, because everything else about this place is great."

After reading all the positive reviews, my wife and I were excited to try this place out. Unfortunately, we were left disappointed. Let me start with the positive - the food was really good. We shared the Southern Yard bird burger, which was flavorful and delicious. The truffle fries and jalape√±o poppers were also a hit, served in a unique shot glass of dipping sauce. However, the service was a major letdown. It was evident that our waiter and waitress were not properly trained. We had a hard time getting their attention and even getting our bill at the end. It's a shame because the food could have easily earned them a higher rating. But with such poor service, it's hard to overlook. Would I come back? Maybe for takeout, but definitely not for dine-in."

I was excited to try this place after hearing great things about it, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The menu boasted a variety of delicious-sounding dishes, but when it came time to order, we were disappointed to find out that we had to pay extra for basic items like chips and marinated carrots. To make matters worse, the customer service was subpar. Our server seemed annoyed when we asked about the additional charges and the tea we ordered was out. The cashier disappeared multiple times, leaving us waiting for simple requests.

Even the ambiance couldn't make up for the disappointment. We noticed that the parking lot was practically empty at 5pm, which should have been a red flag. And while the food we did order was decent, it definitely didn't justify the hefty price tag. After a single cocktail and a bottle of water, our total bill was a whopping $76.

Overall, our experience at this restaurant left much to be desired. It's a shame because we really wanted to like it, but unfortunately, the lackluster customer service and high prices left a bad taste in our mouths. We won't be returning anytime soon."

During my recent visit, I decided to try out the food court at this establishment. Let's just say, it was a less than stellar experience. First of all, the cashier seemed to be in a heated argument with the bus boy in the middle of taking my order. It was quite off-putting and made me feel uncomfortable. The exchange went something like this:

Old lady: ""Jinhuan u no gud""

Jinhuan: ""I gud.""

Old lady: ""No u no gud.""

Jinhuan: ""I rear gud.""

Old lady: ""WONGTONGBONGSONG!!!!!!!! U NO GUD.""

It was definitely not the most professional way to handle a disagreement. As a customer, I shouldn't have to witness such unprofessional behavior.

But that wasn't even the worst part. The food itself was mediocre at best. I had the misfortune of ordering from the food court and if I had the option, I would give it a 1-star rating. The Japanese/Korean rice was cheap, but that was the only thing going for it. The rest of the food was underwhelming and unappetizing. It's safe to say that I won't be returning to the food court anytime soon.

However, I did find a silver lining in the supermarket section. The Kimchee was surprisingly tasty and I would consider going back just for that. But overall, my experience at this establishment was disappointing. The cheap prices may have lured me in, but the lack of quality in the food and the unprofessional behavior of the staff left a sour taste in my mouth. I might give it a second chance for the Kimchee, but the food court is definitely a no-go for me. "

I recently dined at this restaurant during my visit to the NC Music Factory. The ambiance was sleek and modern, with leather chairs and stunning artwork adorning the walls. The highlight of the decor was the gas fire place in the center of the dining room, adding a touch of elegance to the space.

Conveniently located in the heart of the NC Music Factory, parking was not an issue and valet was available during busy times. The outdoor patio was a great addition, with chic chairs and cozy tables perfect for people-watching in the summertime.

I couldn't resist trying the lobster spread as an appetizer, served on perfectly toasted bread. It was a generous portion and so delicious that I couldn't help but devour most of it. The lobster spread was light and addictive, leaving me wanting more.

For my main course, I ordered the sea bass over pumpkin-lobster orzo. While the orzo was a standout with large chunks of lobster, the sea bass itself was disappointing. It lacked flavor and was quite thin. Thankfully, the orzo was able to save the dish and overall, it was still enjoyable.

The bar area, located at the entrance of the dining room, was dark and romantic - the perfect spot for a drink. I can imagine it being a popular spot for a date night. Despite the positives, I was ultimately left unimpressed by my experience. The 2-star rating is due to the lackluster sea bass and the fact that the loud techno music from the neighboring club could be heard throughout the entire hotel until 4 am. It's a shame because the hotel has so much potential, but the poor soundproofing and disruptive music made it a sleepless and unpleasant stay. I would not return and caution anyone against staying here."

This place was a major letdown. I was excited to try out this new bar, but from the moment we walked in, the bartender's attitude was less than welcoming. The drinks we ordered were weak and lacked any real flavor. As someone who appreciates a good cocktail, I was sorely disappointed. To make matters worse, the bartender seemed more interested in chatting with his co-workers than actually serving his customers. My glass sat empty for far too long, and when my boyfriend arrived, he couldn't even order the drink he wanted because they were out of ingredients. We ended up leaving and heading to the Burgundy Lion down the street, where we were greeted with a smile and served expertly crafted drinks. Don't waste your time or money here, there are much better options just a short walk away."

The atmosphere at Sapporo is definitely one to rave about. It's modern, with cool features like fish tanks in the walls and flames adding to the ambiance. As soon as we walked in, we were excited for a vibrant evening ahead. We even made a reservation and had no issues getting in on a Tuesday night.

However, things quickly went downhill when it came to the service. We ordered apps and they came out quickly, but after waiting for an hour and a half, our chef still hadn't shown up. We started to get anxious, especially since the family at our table with two small children had to leave before they could even enjoy their food. The waitress had to come over and ask us if we still planned on sticking around. That's when we realized something was seriously wrong.

Eventually, the chef finally showed up and put on his little show. But by that time, we were already feeling frustrated and disappointed. To be honest, the chef paled in comparison to the one at the adjacent table who seemed more lively and entertaining. Maybe our chef was just trying to rush through making our food so we wouldn't have to wait any longer.

In the end, we stayed and thankfully our apps were comped, but it was still a disappointing and lengthy experience overall. The only reason I'm giving Sapporo three stars is because the food was actually delicious. I have a feeling that on most nights and for the majority of customers, the experience is much better than ours. I would potentially give it another try, but this first experience left much to be desired."

The menu had some interesting sandwich options so I decided to try The Vito at this deli. The service was quick, which was a nice surprise, but unfortunately, the sandwich itself was a bit underwhelming. The bread was dry and even ripped from the weight of the fillings, making it difficult to eat. It wasn't terrible, but it definitely didn't have me running back for more.

1151,"Where to start.  Hubby and I stopped here for takeout 5/31/13. He ordered the BBQ short ribs, and I ordered the bourbon chicken - to go.  We also ordered two of the boba teas. While we were waiting for our food, I decided to use the restroom. It looked like the floor hadn't seen a mop in a month. I went back out to the dining area and took a good look around. It was clean, and from what I could see of the kitchen, it appeared clean. OK, so maybe someone just doesn't like to clean the restroom.\n\nWe got our food in a timely manner and headed home. When we got home, I discovered something I'd never seen before. We had both ordered the macaroni salad with our meals. Both of our meals had that salad in the same to-go container as our hot food!  What the??  This made the salad extremely warm and gross. On top of that, the sauce from my chicken had invaded that compartment of the container. Yuck!\n\nOK, so maybe the scoop of salad isn't such a big deal, we can eat the rest of our meal. Here's where the review gets confusing. While both the ribs and chicken were cooked very nicely, there was NO flavor to either of them. \n\nDoubtful we will be back, unless just to grab a boba, since those were fine."
1152,"Ehh. We went into Carmines after walking by it on our way to Trevi in the forum shops (which to start off, I would advise you to go there instead). Seeing that it was family style, we were excited. So we decide to give it a try and our experience was not very good.\n\nThey start out by giving you one menu for the table and some cold bread. I wouldn't complain about cold bread, however this bread had some sort of marinara sauce on it, so it was cold crust sauce on cold bread. They also gave out odd pretzel like sticks as well. We look at the pasta dishes and decide to get the \""Ragu\"", the most expensive thing on the menu. Meatballs, sausage, and pork. Sounds good! We get the dish and it gets served out...and it was just gross. WAY too much sauce, which is WAY too acidy. Trust me, I have been going to italian places since the 70's when I lived in New York. This sauce was horrible. Maybe the can they used was bad? The meatballs were just that...basic balls of meat. And the sausage was just one long sausage...not even sliced or cooked well. The pork was also weird...just salty skins of pork randomly placed in this garbage pile.\n\nNeedless to say after the 4 of us decided we were eating sh*t, we told the waitress and she immediately took our plates and the pasta away. 10 minutes later she hands us the bill, which is for the entire plate of pasta we didn't eat. What?? We ask the manager and she takes the bill in a huff....and returns with the bill with the drinks for about $12. The waitresses advice? Try not to order pasta if you don't want to eat something acidy. \n\nWe left a $20 and left and went to Trevi for a real dinner. I'm guessing this place only survives because it is in a tourist trap and most tourists aren't looking for quality food."
1153,"I've always wanted to stay at the Luxor so was glad to finally have the chance, and would certainly do so again in future.\n\nWe originally booked a Pyramid Room, and was upgraded to a room in one of the Towers. Though I would have loved to have stayed in the Pyramid itself, a King size bed was much more enticing.\n\nOur room was clean and large (Hello two wardrobes with lights? I like!), the shower and the bath tub being separate to one another was a bit odd, but whatever. The bed itself was amazingly comfortable. I'm usually not a fan of hotel beds, but plenty of soft pillows, comfortable mattress and clean bedding.\n\nThe resort fee? Lame. If you're going to charge me extra, how about having WiFi? For all the marketing around the hotel encouraging you to Check in on Foursquare or get social with the Luxor, providing WiFi to your paying guests seems like a no brainer.\n\nWe did receive 2 free drink coupons for each night we were staying at the hotel, so the additional resort fee wasn't that big of a deal as we got 6 drinks out of it. Heads up if you're expecting the included newspaper to arrive in the morning at your room - it doesn't, you need to pick it up in a store near the check-in. \n\nAlso, if you're craving coffee in the morning, you'll just have to suck up the additional cost Starbucks charges in the hotel, the prices are jacked up, but to be expected.\n\nCons: \n\n- End of the strip\n- Mandatory resort fee\n- No WiFi\n- No coffee maker in your room\n- Worst buffet\n- Pool isn't open very late (closed at 6pm while we were there)\n \nPros:\n\n- Dude. Ancient Egyptian theme. Sweet!\n- Pretty inexpensive for Vegas\n- Titanic Exhibit. Surprisingly very good. Was expecting something super cheesy but it was very well put together and curated.\n- Easy connections to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay\n- Possible Criss Angel spottings makes for much hilarity. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our check-in was pretty quick (we arrived 11pm on a Friday night), quick check out and clean, comfortable room. I'd stay again for sure, but probably won't for some time as I like to try out different hotels when in Vegas."
1154,"I have been to this restaurant before because i attend a comedy show across the street every Saturday night.  I took my friend in with me for the first time and tried to order a cal-zone.  I asked for the cal-zone to be made with no peppers on onions on half, to this reply they stated this is impossible and they can not do this.  I spent 3 years working in a pizza restaurant and know this is completely something they would have been capable of.  I was even nice enough to explain how to make it and they still refused to make what we wanted.  Not only did they refuse but they had a horrible attitude in regards to it.  In fact the first guy that was helping us left without saying a work then another female came up and had even a worse attitude problem.  I even asked if I could speak to the guy who would make the pizza and explain to him how to do it and the continued to say no.  At this pizza restaurant its either THEIR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY, if you have  any allergies or do not like certain things on your pizzas/calzones I would recommend NOT going there. In face we left and ordered pizza hut and got 3 times the food for the price and the way we wanted it."

I stumbled upon this bar on a website for die-hard Packer fans and was excited to check it out. However, my experience was not quite as amazing as I had hoped. The service was a bit rude and it made me feel like I wasn't really welcome there. Maybe it was just an off day, but I couldn't shake the feeling of being unwelcome. Despite this, I did try some of the food and was pleasantly surprised by the bar's signature dish, the Tara-bull. However, the rest of the menu was mediocre at best. And to be honest, I could have easily gotten a similar meal at one of the casual joints on the strip. On the bright side, the lady who works there has a great scream when there's a good play or extra point. Overall, it was just an okay experience. I might give it another try, but only if I'm feeling particularly antisocial and want to be left alone. "

This hidden gem in the CMU/UPITT area offers some of the best Asian cuisine in Pittsburgh. I recently came back here after graduating and was reminded of why I fell in love with this place in the first place.

The food here is everything you could want in Asian cuisine - flavorful, delicious, and comforting. My friends and I ordered 6 dishes and each one was better than the last. The Rangoon Night Market Noodle was a stand-out dish, with its thin flat noodles and flavorful sauce. The panang curry may have had a thicker consistency, but it still hit the spot for my Thai food cravings. And the Java fried rice was devoured within minutes, with its perfect blend of soy sauce and sesame oil. Even the Thai iced tea was delicious, despite the slightly higher price.

However, despite the amazing food, the atmosphere and service fell a bit short. The dimly lit interior and tattered menus gave off a less-than-stellar first impression. And the fact that all members of the party must be present to be seated can be a bit inconvenient. But don't let those minor issues deter you, because the food here is what truly shines.

Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try - especially if you're in the mood for some authentic and flavorful Asian food. While the atmosphere and service may not be top-notch, the food more than makes up for it. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes from their menu."
1157,"The pizza is pretty good but the service could be A LOT better.\n\nCame here for takeout on a Monday night.  When I got in line, there was only one other couple in front of me.   I ordered a simple margherita pizza with mushrooms.  Overall the crust was good but burnt even for a neopolitan style pizza.  The sauce is good but overwhelmingly garlicky (and I love garlic).  The cheese melted well but soon came tough and rubbery.  The basil was nonexistent.  I was most disappointed by the first bite, mainly because everything slid right off.  \n\nAs for the salad, also underwhelming.  I got the burrata with artichoke tapanade and olives.  There was almost no arugula.  The olives were extremely salty.  Also of note, nobody bothered to make the salad while my pizza was cooking despite there being almost no wait.  I had to wait first for the salad, then for the bread to be toasted.  So maybe that's why by the time I ate my pizza it was a rubbery,  soggy mess.\n\nOverall, pretty pricey for mediocre food.  Don't think I'll be returning if i can help it!"

I have been a patient of Dr. Brodkin for many years now and have had nothing but positive experiences. From the moment I walked into the beautiful office, I was greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff, especially Ana and Wendy, are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I have always felt like I was in good hands with Dr. Brodkin, and she has been there for me through two pregnancies, delivering my first child and about to deliver my second. She truly treats her patients as friends and has developed such a wonderful rapport with me. I travel the extra distance just to see her and could not imagine going to anyone else. However, during my last visit, I was disappointed with the wait time. The appointment took longer than expected, and it was frustrating to have to wait so long. Additionally, while the office and staff are amazing, I was a bit disappointed with the care I received from the nurse practitioner. I didn't feel like my concerns were fully addressed and her approach seemed rushed. Despite these issues, I would still highly recommend Dr. Brodkin and her office for anyone seeking a caring and respectful doctor. "
1159,"I would give this place a 2.5 but since I can't I'm going to give it a 2.  I was not impressed with this place although I should have been.  The place was lively and comfortable.  Peanut shells on the floor and a Jack-elope bust on the wall always make me feel at home.  The waitress was great but this is where this review takes a turn for the worst.\n\nI ordered the full rack of ribs and my wife got the steak.  The appetizer salads they brought out were so filled with cheese and very buttery croutons that there was less veg than toppers.  The big problem were the ribs for me.  They were dry, and I mean bone dry which is no good.  My wife's steak was huge and done well so no complaints.  We finished it off with apple pie that had a strange carmel topping on the side that spread like warm taffy... not impressed.\n\nNot the worst but I have definitely seen better.  Price isn't too bad for a \""steak house,\"" but Ill take my business elsewhere next time."
1160,"This place is delish! Every time we have family or friends visiting vegas we take them here on Sundays. Red velvet pancakes are amazing! I only gave three stars because compared to the other babystacks their Adobo fried rice omelet is on the salty side, too much to bare. You need to drink a ton of water or eat more rice to balance all the salt intake. I thought it was only one day but been there several times and still so salty. Wish they took reservations or possibly putting our name on the waiting list as we drive there. Oh well. Guess that's how they make their money. I still drive to the original babystacks to get there adobo fried rice omelet. Just waiting for the Henderson location to get it right. Otherwise everything else is yummy!!"

I was excited to try Little Texas for the first time, especially after hearing great things about their burgers. I ordered the burger and fries, and I have to say, it was juicy and cooked perfectly. The owners, a lovely couple, were very friendly and provided great service. However, I was disappointed to see that the menu was quite limited, with only a few sandwich options available in addition to the burgers and ribs. Also, the location was a bit hard to find, located behind a strip mall off of Florence Boulevard. But overall, I was willing to overlook these minor issues for the delicious burger. However, my experience took a nosedive when I decided to order the baby back ribs. The smell was absolutely tantalizing, but to my disappointment, they were completely sold out. How can a restaurant that specializes in ribs be out of them? It was a major letdown, especially since I was looking forward to trying them. And to make matters worse, the owner, Andrew, made no effort to apologize or offer any alternative options. I couldn't believe it. Now, I'm sitting here with nothing to eat but my burger and fries, and I can't help but give Little Texas a one star review for their lack of availability and poor service. So disappointed."
1162,"Finally I get to write a review i honestly feel is not 5 stars.A group of about 10 friends stayed here over the weekend and The rooms were cold, the suites were awesome, thought not quite worth the price. The elevator keys were annoying since they could get you to any floor, almost pointless. The parking was free which was pretty awesome. Our tv was hit or miss for actually working, we had to call a maintenance man at one point. It took 2.5 hours for him to show up too....\nAnyways if you have an iphone just forget about it working. I mean its not even worth trying. All of us were texting each other and receiving various messages hours later. making a phone call was worthless so we resorted to land lines. \nIf all you want is comfy beds and blinds that shut out the sunlight this is the place for you. everything else was hit and miss"
1163," It's a great place for a quick bite and chat with a friend, but unfortunately, the service can be hit or miss. The first time I went, the server was attentive and helped with wine selections, but on a recent visit, our server seemed to be overwhelmed and was not very friendly. The food also took a while to come out, despite the restaurant not being too busy. Overall, the atmosphere is lovely but the service may not match up. I would suggest trying it out for yourself and seeing how it goes.

After a day of running errands, I stopped by this cute little spot for some lunch and a glass of wine. The atmosphere is charming, with a helpful legend to guide you through the wine selection process. The sushi was tasty, and I especially enjoyed the jalapeno yellow tail. However, the service was a bit hit or miss. During my first visit, the server was attentive and made great wine suggestions. But on my most recent visit, our server seemed overwhelmed and was not very friendly. Our food also took a while to come out, even though the restaurant wasn't busy. It's a shame, because the price point is good and they have a variety of options for a quick bite. Maybe it was just an off day, but I was disappointed with the service overall. I would recommend giving this place a try, as the atmosphere and food are nice, but be prepared for potential slow and unfriendly service."

I had a disappointing experience at this pizzeria. I ordered the vegetarian pizza for delivery, but when it arrived, it was missing one of the key ingredients - avocado. Not only that, but the delivery guy didn't have any change, so I was forced to either pay $10 for a sandwich I wasn't satisfied with or turn it away. I decided to give the sandwich a chance, but even with a magnifying glass, I couldn't find the avocado hidden in between the cheese. I called to express my disappointment and was met with a dismissive response. Needless to say, I won't be ordering from here again. On a positive note, the pizza itself was decent, but the overall experience left a bad taste in my mouth."

I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. After seeing some good reviews, I was excited to try their bento box and caterpillar roll. Unfortunately, neither lived up to my expectations. The bento box had some okay options, but the teriyaki chicken was not as grilled as I like and the sauce was not what I'm used to. And the caterpillar roll was decent, but definitely not the best I've had. Even the tempura, which was pretty good, could have been cooked a little bit crispier. Overall, it was just an average meal. Definitely not on the same level as Ichi Riki in Seaside, CA which is my go-to spot for bento boxes. Maybe I just had higher expectations, but I was left feeling underwhelmed. So, if you're looking for a top-notch bento experience, you might want to keep searching. On the bright side, the atmosphere is nice and casual, so dress comfortably. But personally, I would not recommend this place. Maybe they do other dishes better, but based on my experience, I'd suggest trying somewhere else for your bento fix."
1166,"The food is really good and I like that you get to pick all your items. However, the bar sucks. Not only does it have slow service but they also give you barely any alcohol in your drinks and you could leave with a stomach ache from all of the mix they give you."
1167,Negative: I had a steak meal here which made me sick for an entire week. Hell I was pissed. \n\n\nPositives : Great Hotel Rooms (very comfy) and not so expensive. There's flat screen TVs which you don't find in every hotel.\nGraveyard bowling at 1 dollar a game (if I remember correctly) rocked. Pure awesomeness. \n\n(I can't help giving a 1 rating on this despite the positives)

We had high hopes for our dining experience at Avanti, but unfortunately, it fell a bit short. The decor caught our attention right away - it was unique and refreshing, with red walls and beautiful roses. The owner who greeted us was very friendly and welcoming.

However, things started to go downhill once we were seated. Our plates were taken away before we even had a chance to decide on our order, and then we were given bread without any plates to eat it on. It turned out to be garlic bread, which we were not informed of, but it was still tasty.

The appetizer we ordered, a sampler of three different pastas, was lukewarm and lacked any real exceptional flavors. We didn't want to send it back, but it was not something we could rave about either.

To make matters worse, my girlfriend's entree was not made correctly. However, the server did fix it quickly and even brought us a complimentary dessert. Both of our entrees were just okay - nothing to write home about.

We were also surprised to see that our bill came out to be $90, even though we had a deal for $20 off. We found the prices at Avanti to be a bit higher than what the food and experience warranted.

Overall, while we appreciated the gorgeous decor and friendly owner, our experience at Avanti was just average. We had higher expectations and were left feeling underwhelmed. Unfortunately, we will not be returning."

Had to douse it with tobasco to taste anything\nGF ordered the frech toast with bananas. Came with 2 eggs, side of bacon. Pretty tasty fresh toast. Only thing i wondered was why they cut the banana in half but left the peel. Had to scrape the edible part out from the peel\n\nIt was an OK eats. Was more let down than anything because I read great things about it."

The atmosphere at Pacino's was definitely a highlight - the live music and dim lighting created a great vibe. Our server was also very friendly, bringing us water as soon as we sat down. However, the food was a major letdown. My friend had recommended the eggplant Parmesan, but when it finally came out an HOUR later, it turned out to be chicken instead. It took another 10 minutes for my actual order to arrive, and by then, the excitement had died down. The house salad was also disappointing, just a plate of plain lettuce. The shrimp ravioli was just okay, nothing special. Overall, the experience was underwhelming and we probably won't be returning."

Wow, where do I even begin with this experience? After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant but decided to give it a chance. Oh, how I regret that decision. From beginning to end, it was a complete disaster.

First of all, I made an appointment with a camera guy at the store I ran into them at. He seemed nice, but as soon as I got there, I could tell he was in a rush. I felt like I was just another customer to him, nothing special. But the real nightmare began when I went to pick up my photos.

Not one, but TWO girls cornered me and started praising these horrendous photos. I'm not one to be easily persuaded, so their compliments did nothing for me. Then they had the nerve to try and sell me a $500 package. I quickly shut that down and said I would just take the small package I had already paid for.

But oh no, they wouldn't let me leave that easily. They kept trying to bring down the price, insisting that their photos were top-notch quality. Well, let me tell you, they were far from it. The pictures looked like they were taken with a disposable camera and printed at home. When I asked to just buy one photo of my son, they refused because they only sell in packages. How does that even make sense?

Long story short, I ended up leaving with the package I paid for, but only after a long and exhausting battle with these brainwashed salespeople. The quality of the photos was horrendous, with visible grains and poor resolution. And yet, they had the audacity to argue with me and try to convince me that their photos were the best.

I would give this place zero stars if I could. The only positive thing I can say is that the last reviewer was too kind by giving them two stars. Trust me, save yourself the headache and take your business elsewhere for quality photos. Don't be fooled by their slick sales tactics and empty promises. This place is a total disappointment."

I happened to stumble upon Silver Sevens on my way to the airport and decided to check it out. And let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised! While I didn't actually stay at the hotel, I did have a great time trying out their gaming options before heading off to catch my flight. Their poker machines and slots had such a wide variety and I actually had better luck here than at any of the other casinos I visited during my trip. And let me tell you, that's saying something considering I hit up a bunch of popular spots. 

I also appreciated how easy it was to get a players card through their DMV insert kiosk - quick and efficient. My date and I had a blast playing blackjack and we even managed to snag some cool souvenirs from their gift shop - who wouldn't want a Silver Sevens shot glass? The selection of restaurants nearby was also a major plus. From hoffbrau house to Italian to a Brazilian steakhouse - there's something for everyone's taste buds. And if you're in the mood for a low-key night, there's also a dive bar and a pizza spot nearby. 

While I didn't get to try out all the amenities, I can confidently say that Silver Sevens is worth a visit. And who knows, maybe next time I'll actually get to stay there and try out their sport bar and sports book. With plenty of parking and a convenient location, I'll definitely be coming back to Silver Sevens for some more fun. Maybe next time I'll even get lucky and win big!"

I've have many great nights out at the NC Music Factory so I was pretty excited to check it out. \n\nAfter spending a few hours at Fridays at the Factories we headed in to Wet Willies. We waited in a random line even though it was pretty empty inside. The hold up? They were using electronic handheld scanners to check ID's. I've never seen this in Charlotte, but I assume its no big deal. I thought wrong.\n\nThe girls infront of us ID's would not scan, but they got pushed right thru. My friends ID scanned fine. My ID would not scan for some unknown reason. They tried 5+ times, but could not get it to register. So I'm just standing there.. waiting.. Finally after inspecting my ID like it was some kind of fake they show me this piece of paper. This paper has peoples names, addresses, etc. All sorts of contact information just laying out on the counter. They explain I have to write in my information to get in.\n\nYeah right. You just let two females in, but want me to fill out some paper work? The bouncers had no ideas the females where with us so I pulled them and my friend back out. I explained I was leaving. They just gave me a 'so what' look. \n\nI walked next door and walked right in to Black Bear Saloon where the experience was great.

I visited this establishment with my family for a quick lunch. We arrived early and there was already a line of senior citizens eagerly waiting to enter. It was interesting to see them counting down the minutes until they could get in. Once inside, we noticed that there were three different cafe style lines to order food from. We opted for the one with the shortest line, but unfortunately, our experience was hindered by the behavior of some of the older patrons. They seemed to think they were entitled to jump ahead of others in line, completely disregarding common courtesy. Meanwhile, the younger customers were well-mannered and patient. As for the food, the onion rings were tasty but the pizza left something to be desired. It was a strange combination of flavors that didn't quite hit the mark. On a positive note, the ambiance was nice and we were able to see the world's largest organ of its kind. Overall, it was an okay experience."

Our experience at La Casa was a mix of highs and lows. Walking into the restaurant, we were immediately impressed by the beautiful decor and our lovely waitress who greeted us with a warm smile. The sangria was delicious and reasonably priced at just $6 a glass. We couldn't resist ordering a second round as we soaked up the ambiance in hopes of a great dining experience.

When it came time to order, we followed the advice of our waitress and tried a variety of dishes. The Tchoutchouka and warm bread with pesto balsamic sauce were definite highlights. The Calamaras with salsa picante and Patatas bravas also satisfied our taste buds. But unfortunately, not every dish hit the mark.

We were disappointed with the Croquettas de Verduras, which ended up being nothing like traditional fried croquettes. The flattened peppers with stuffing just didn't do it for us. And the Casablanca sardinas were a letdown with so many bones to contend with. The Paella de Verduras also fell flat without any meat in it.

As for the Gambas al ajillio, it was just okay. While it had potential, the lack of flavor left us wanting more. Overall, our experience at La Casa was a mixed bag. While there were some standout dishes, the misses and mehs left us feeling underwhelmed. And with slightly higher prices, we were unfortunately expecting a bit more from our meal.

We may give La Casa another chance, hoping for a different outcome, but for now, we'll stick to the sangria and maybe a few tapas."

I was excited to try this place after hearing so many great things, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. While the food was decent, the service left a lot to be desired. Our waitress was not very attentive and never mentioned the specials, which I later found out were apparently the best part. As someone who loves trying unique dishes, I was disappointed that we missed out on that opportunity. The atmosphere and music were nice, and I appreciated the option of non-alcoholic drinks like the house-made lemonade. However, I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth when I saw that the bill included a charge for lemonade that I never ordered.

I was excited to visit this store after seeing it from afar - the clothes looked so trendy and stylish! But, disappointingly, my experience inside was far from that. The clothes were not what I expected and the prices were ridiculous for the quality. I felt like I was being taken advantage of. \n\nOn top of that, the customer service was lacking. The sales associate was friendly at first but then a friend came in and they both sat and chatted while I was trying to browse. It made me feel uncomfortable.

We were so excited to have our wedding at the Springs Preserve. The venue was beautiful and our initial planner was incredibly helpful. However, things quickly took a turn for the worse as we were caught right in the middle of some contract changes.

Our initial planner was unable to see us through the entire process, leaving us feeling confused and frustrated. We had to constantly re-explain our vision and preferences to the new planner, making the whole experience feel disjointed and unorganized.

On the day of the wedding, the set up was nicely done and everything ran smoothly. But the stress of constantly dealing with staff changes and last minute adjustments definitely took away from our special day.

In terms of regular activities, the Springs Preserve is a great place for weekend family time. The exhibits are engaging and perfect for kids. However, the organization and coordination of their special functions leaves much to be desired. We attended the Easter Egg Hunt and were disappointed by the overcrowding and lack of clear direction.

To top it off, their receipts have a taunting statement that says ""Concerns please call"" with no contact number provided. Talk about adding insult to injury. Overall, our experience with the Springs Preserve was far from satisfactory. We would recommend looking elsewhere for your special event needs, as this establishment falls short of delivering a quality and consistent service."

Within our group of four, none of us had been there before but were all happy with the food. \n\nWe had a couple of instances where our server may have gotten overwhelmed.

I was not impressed with their chicken taco but was very happy with the pork (had pineapple in it too). For the bigger eater, the bill can run a bit high than you might expect but you can tell this is absolutely a great spot for happy hour.\n\nWe will be back!"

I was really looking forward to getting my shutters installed, but unfortunately, my experience at this company fell short. When I first walked in, I was greeted by a friendly and polite receptionist, which initially made me think this would be a great experience. And don't get me wrong, the shutters themselves are amazing - they truly add that extra touch to my home. However, the whole process leading up to the installation was a bit of a nightmare. I was promised a 3-week timeline, but it ended up taking over a month. On top of that, when the day for installation finally arrived, I received a call from John saying that the shutters weren't even in the warehouse. After some digging, he managed to find them, but now I have to wait another week for them to be installed because he's booked up. This is definitely a downside of dealing with a small company - there just isn't enough staff to handle everything efficiently.

Perhaps it's a good thing that the wait for installation was prolonged, because now I've had some time to reflect on my experience with the company. While the receptionist was lovely, I have to say that my interactions with the other staff members left a lot to be desired. The assistant who gave me the shots, a young, short-haired Latin girl, was not very gentle with my children. In fact, her demeanor was quite cold and it made my little ones feel very uncomfortable. As if the long wait and inefficient process wasn't bad enough, having someone like her handling vaccination for kids was definitely not a highlight of the whole experience.

Overall, I have to give this company a three-star rating. While the product itself is great, the wait time and unprofessionalism of some of the staff definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. I would recommend this place to others, but with caution and a warning to be prepared for potential delays and unsatisfactory service."

My friends and I were excited to try out this highly recommended burger spot. The first thing that caught our eye was the impeccable interior design - a mix of rustic and modern elements that gave off a trendy vibe. While my friend described it as ""old school"", I found it unique and refreshing, especially with the beautiful roses adorning the red walls.

We were greeted by the owner himself, who was friendly and welcoming. Sadly, the rest of our experience didn't quite live up to our expectations. Our plates were taken away as soon as we sat down, leaving us perplexed and without any dishes to eat our bread on. Speaking of bread, their garlic bread was delicious, but we were never informed that it didn't need any butter or spreads.

We ordered the sampler appetizer, which came with three different pastas. While they all tasted fine, they were lukewarm - not bad enough to send back, but definitely not something we would rave about. My friend's entree was also made incorrectly, but the server quickly rectified the issue and even threw in a free dessert as an apology.

As for the main courses, the burgers were perfectly cooked and juicy, but we were a bit disappointed with the limited options for cheese and buns. However, the shoestring fries were a saving grace - crispy, seasoned, and addictively delicious. We did wish they had other fry options, but we were satisfied with ordering two servings of the shoestring fries.

Overall, while we enjoyed our meal, we couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed. The $20 off deal was a nice perk, but we were taken aback when the bill came to $90. For that price, we were expecting the entrees to be more outstanding. While we would still recommend this place for their burgers and ambiance, we would advise others to be mindful of the prices before ordering."

I've been a loyal customer at this place for years, but I have to admit, it's starting to lose its charm. Don't get me wrong, the staff is great and the atmosphere is still cozy and inviting, but the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the place has been neglected for far too long.

The floors are sticky and the carpets have seen better days. The bathrooms are in desperate need of a deep clean, with mop stains that have been there for over a year. And let's not even get started on the AC and keg system that seem to be permanently on the fritz.

As for the food, it's hit or miss. Sometimes it's delicious and other times it's just not up to par. And the inconsistency in quality has been going on for far too long. I understand that the staff is not responsible for deep cleaning the entire place, but it's about time management hires someone to give the place a much-needed makeover.

I know I'm not the only regular who has noticed the decline in this place. It's a beloved spot for many of us, but with new restaurants popping up in the area, it's time for this one to step up its game. A fresh coat of paint, some new ceiling tiles, and a proper cleaning would make all the difference.

Don't get me wrong, I'll still come here for the great company and familiar faces, but I really hope management takes note of these issues and gives this place the attention it deserves. After all, who wants to drink beer in a sticky and dirty bar?"
1187,"I wasn't impressed. Maybe you need to go in the am but we walked in and I was excited to try something new. I asked the guy behind the counter what was the most popular item and he said it was the cream cheese croissants. He told me people order it by the buckets. I decided to try it and my husband got the cronut. The guy also said free upgrade from small to large boba because they ran out of small cups. My husband was a sucker and said yea. \n\nVerdict: the boba milk tea was overly sweet and the boba was hard. The cream cheese croissant was good but not necessarily something I would go back for. My husband wasn't impressed with his cronut either. Overall it's an ok place, but I definitely would not be back anytime soon."
1188,"sad part is Ive been putting off writing this review for awhile b/c I didnt want to think about it. \n\nBAR: I live really close to this casino maybe 7-10 minutes. the 1st time I came here the bar was kind of hidden behind the Roxy. But we really enjoyed it. Especially the gentleman bartender I want to say his name is Robert or Raul. Well since the renovation we came bk and sat at the bar which opens out to an awesome view of the mystic falls scenery and different colored christmas lights. \n\nMy last visit here was not too long ago, shortly after my bday inwhich my bf gave me a VERY EXPENSIVE NEW PURSE. We'd seen it while shopping almost a year ago and he remembered and went bk to get it. Sweet right? well I put my very new expensive purse in the empty chair nxt to me. . Ladies understand this. . \n\nthe guy kept grabbing my purse and the chair closer to him. so i pulled it back since this made me very VERY nervous. Then he yells at me saying how do you know someone's not sitting there? I said b/c there's nobody sitting there and no food there. so he slides a drink in front of it. after taking a huge sip? wth? really? I ignored him, an hr later and to make a long story short he gets the manager and she sides w/ him and instead of being mad at the fact that he grabbed my purse out of my hands and threw it across the bar - she gets a chair to put my purse nxt to the chair it was already in. \n\nLuckily the guy and his imaginary friend finished cussing me out and left. I will never go bk. The bartender the male and female were both nice to me but neithe rof them stuck for me to tell the manager that no, there was never anybody sitting there and this guy was being a jerk to a local patron. \n\nThe custoemr that sat there after him was so nice and bought my bf and I a round of drinks, so nice. he was visiting from CA and was great.  Sad how you can have both ends of the spectrum within minutes. I cant blame the bar/cantina for the behaviour of this guy but I can blame them for the handling of the situation. Looking back I should have just left when he started harrassing me but hindsight is 20/20. \nI will never go back to this casino again."

This so unethical. They just wasted my time & money. Now, i have to wait for return process. Wait couple days to receive money in my account."

C-Note wrote about this place: Let me just start off by saying, I have never left a bad Yelp review before. But after my experience at this restaurant, I couldn't keep quiet. The service was subpar, to say the least. Our waitress was obviously overwhelmed and understaffed, but that's no excuse for the lack of attention and care she showed to our table. It took her multiple trips before she even noticed my empty drink glass. And when she finally did, she just plopped down a pitcher of water without even asking what I wanted. Talk about lazy service. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the food. The chips and salsa were the only redeeming factor, and even that was mediocre at best. The salsa tasted like it had been left out for hours and was way too watery. As for the main dishes, let's just say I've had better microwave meals. The meat was dry and flavorless, and the rest of the dish was just as bland. I can honestly say it was one of the worst meals I've ever had. \n\nI hate to be so negative, but I really don't see myself giving this place a second chance. Maybe they were just having an off night, but with so many other dining options in the area, I'll take my chances elsewhere. My advice? Zip it in and zip it out. Not worth the disappointment or the money. "
1191,"Upon entering subway this evening (12/11/14) there were no workers out front. After hearing the bell ring multiple times from two other guests entering and one leaving, as well as the phone ringing and customers shouting \""hello\"" into the back, two unhappy workers emerged from the back with not so much as a hello or a smile. Not only is it ridiculous to wait ten minutes with no one checking to see if a customer has come in, but the customer service skills of the two workers were some of the worst I've ever seen. Not even so much as an apology for the wait? I for sure will not be coming back to this subway ever again."

We were looking for a quick bite to eat before my parents had to catch their flight, so we decided to stop by this restaurant since it was conveniently located near my brother's apartment. To our disappointment, the service was incredibly slow. Despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy, our waiter took his sweet time getting our orders and bringing out our food. It took 15 minutes just for our soup to come out, and by the time our main courses arrived, we barely had enough time to finish them before rushing off. Speaking of the soup, the portion was huge, but that was the only positive thing we could say about it. As for the rest of our food, it was decent, but definitely not worth the wait. What made the experience even worse was our waiter's lack of attentiveness and poor order of serving our food. It seemed like he was more interested in chatting with his coworkers than taking care of his customers. It's a shame because the food had potential, but the terrible service and long wait time just ruined our experience. I really hope this place improves because I would love to give it another chance. But as of now, I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and hassle-free dining experience. Save yourself the frustration and find somewhere else to eat. "

I was initially wary of staying at this hotel due to the mixed reviews on Yelp, but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The standard room was spacious and had all the necessary amenities, including a large bathroom and a functional TV with cable (they even had AMC, so I didn't miss my favorite show!). Plus, the wired LAN provided great internet connectivity, so no need to worry about spotty WiFi. 

However, there were a few issues that did make my stay less than perfect. For one, the lack of a fridge and microwave was a bit of a bummer, as I had brought some snacks and couldn't properly store or reheat them in my room. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous ""resort fee"" that I had to pay. I mean, what makes this place a ""resort"" anyway? And offering free drink coupons for just beer and well drinks? Come on, I'm in a CASINO - drinks should be complimentary for all gamblers. 

The comfort of the bed also left something to be desired, and the AC was definitely on the louder side. Plus, the dark and unmarked parking lot made it a bit of a challenge to find my way to check in. But the biggest letdown was the lack of direction and service from some of the hotel staff. As a member of MLife, I should have been able to check in at the private area, but no one informed me of this and I ended up waiting in line with everyone else. Not exactly the VIP treatment I was hoping for. 

Despite these issues, I have to say the casino itself was surprisingly enjoyable. Unlike some of the horror stories I read on Yelp, I did not encounter any terrible 6/5 games and there were plenty of low limit options. Sure, the dealers were a bit clumsy and the player rating is manual, but that's a small price to pay for low limit tables and decent odds. And let's not forget the great progressive video poker bank near Baja Fresh - I may not have hit that elusive Royal, but the 8/5 JOB made up for it. 

Overall, I would rate this hotel as a 4 out of 5 for its casino, but only a 2 out of 5 for value due to the added fees and lack of amenities. If you're mainly looking for a budget-friendly gambling experience, this place might work for you. But if you're seeking a true ""resort"" experience, you may want to look"
1194,"This was terrible. The staff was so incredibly rude and not helpful at all. As a tourist town, I expect people to know that tourists will ask questions! Every time we spoke with staff, they were rude or didn't know the answers and didn't do anything to find out. There were no coffee pots in the room, the gym is meh, there are no fridges in the room, and I can't tell you how many times the cleaning staff walked into our room despite the do not disturb sign. I absolutely do NOT recommend."
1195,"Used Yelp to try to find a place to get a breakfast sandwich on our walk up to Edinburgh Castle and Hula looked the most promising. As much as I'd like to support local businesses, I wish we had just gone to Starbucks. I got a bagel with cream cheese and my husband got a ham/cheese bagel. They were fine, but so overpriced. For the same amount of money we could have gotten breakfast sandwiches with better stuff in them (like actual eggs!) from Starbucks."
1196,"Why can't I give 0 stars or better yet negative stars? \n\nNever, ever, ever again! \n\nThough the atmospheres is extreme old school and borderline depressing we used  to stop in frequently because the food was pretty good and the prices reasonable. Having not been there in a while we recently ventured to Oakland to revisit an old standby only to be extremely disappointed.\n\nThe DH ordered a hamburger which was pretty good and generous in size. It's a good thing too because he ended up having to share with me because my crab cake sandwich was inedable. Two bites into it I knew something was wrong - extremely fishy tasting and obviously no where close to fresh. I don't mess around with seafood. Food poisoning is no fun! I pushed my barely touched sandwich away and there it sat for the remainder of our visit. Never an inquiry from our server if there was a problem or if I wanted something else. \n\nWe won't be back. Why bother? Who wants to fight Oakland traffic and parking challenges to eat at a restaurant that hasn't updated their decor in 20 years only to walk away hungry or even worse with food poisoning?"
1197,"I gave this place three chances over the years and each time I was disappointed so I am officially DONE! The latest event: had a slow leak in a tire, called and was told to come on in. I explained that there was no visible reason for the leak so it needed to be removed from the rim and further examined. I arrived and was treated rudely by a man who acted as if I was putting him out by being there and asked \""who told you you could just come in\""? A mere 15 minutes later he came into the GROSS lobby and told me nothing was wrong with the tire, it was fine. I knew that was false but wanted to get my five year old and myself out of there! So I went to TOWER TIRE in Aspinwall and they rock and did the right thing, finding the pin hole and fixing it for $10.70! \nThree chances is enough for me! For decent service for a Honda try Valley Honda in Monreoville."
1198,"Worst service ever!  I am giving it 2 stars because the bathroom toilet is my new lover.  But seriously worst service ever.  Our waitress was such a bitch she actually rolled her eyes and sighed while one of my dining companions asked her questions about the food.  Really?  She had no problem sitting with the 2 dudes at the table right next to us, being little miss flirty flirt.  Every single drink we ordered came without a garnish.  Dirty martini up with olives is not hard.  Vodka tonic always comes with a lime.  Twice we actually went to the bar ourselves to get the garnish.  Totally lame.  I wish I got our servers name so I could personally lambast her here on Yelp.  The manager tried to smooth things over, but when a situation sucks that bad just saying sorry isn't enough buddy.  This place can kiss my ass."
1199,"First time with Avis -- and decidedly the last. My boyfriend and I booked a rental for an upcoming trip and didn't receive a confirmation email. We called to request another sent to us and were puzzled when the reservation was lost, but more so when the customer service agent was unwilling to help us locate it. Our puzzlement turned to indignation when the \""lost\"" reservation somehow ended up charging my boyfriend's credit card just fine.\n\nA week and a half later, the reservation is still MIA, they have not reimbursed any of the charges, and no explanation has been forthcoming. Thankfully the credit card company was notified early on, so if Avis's inept business practices persist, we won't be held accountable."

During my girlfriend's birthday party at Polish, I was fortunate enough to be able to try their famous fish bowl drinks. The atmosphere was lively and fun, but unfortunately, our experience was quickly ruined by a rude bartender. While we were still enjoying our drink, the bartender abruptly snatched away our $20 fish bowl, claiming it was empty. Despite our objections and the fact that our drink was still one-fourth full, the bartender refused to return it and continued walking away. To our surprise, we then saw the same bartender carrying off another fish bowl that clearly still had plenty of drink left. It was clear that the establishment was trying to save money by reusing drinks, but this is unacceptable and unhygienic. It's a shame because the rest of our experience at Polish was pleasant, but the actions of this particular bartender left a sour taste in our mouths. No one should have their drink taken away from them like that without any valid reason. "

My friends and I decided to try out The Boiling Crab after hearing so much hype about it. We were expecting a long wait like at Hot n Juicy, but surprisingly, we were seated right away. The interior is spacious and has a variety of seating options, perfect for groups or even a casual date night.

We started off with a pound of crawfish and shared a giant dungeness crab. The cajun flavoring was on point and the spice level was just as promised. We were impressed with how well the seafood was cooked and it was a fun experience eating straight out of the plastic bags they came in. Just a heads up, you'll definitely need to tie on a bib and use your hands to fully enjoy the feast.

The service was a bit scattered and our waitress seemed overwhelmed, but she was still friendly and had good intentions. The menu also offers non-shellfish options for those who aren't into cracking and sucking like we were.

Overall, The Boiling Crab was a fun and tasty experience. It might not be the fanciest spot, but it's perfect for a casual night out with friends or family. Just don't wear your Sunday best here, you'll thank me later."

I was really excited to try out this painting and mimosas event with a group of friends. I had heard great things about the concept and couldn't wait to channel my inner artist. However, upon arriving at the venue, my enthusiasm quickly turned to disappointment. The space was overcrowded with loud and rowdy groups, making it difficult to even move around. It seemed like everyone was more focused on chugging their drinks than creating a masterpiece. The instructor was friendly enough, but it was hard to hear her over the noise of the crowd.

The real issue came later in the night when the alcohol started to kick in for some of the participants. As the evening went on, things got increasingly chaotic. People were stumbling around and spilling their drinks everywhere. At one point, someone even knocked over my paintbrushes and ruined my painting. And don't even get me started on the bathroom situation. It was a mess and the smell was unbearable.

The final straw was when we finally finished our paintings and wanted to grab some late-night snacks at the restaurant. But, surprise surprise, it was filled with loud and obnoxious customers from the event. We ended up having to leave and find somewhere else to eat.

I really wanted to enjoy this event and have a fun, creative night with my friends, but the rowdy and drunken atmosphere ruined it for me. Maybe it's just not my scene, but I was extremely disappointed with the type of crowd this event seemed to attract. It's a shame because I can see the potential and the staff seemed great, but the customers really put a damper on the whole experience. "
1205,"This place is great if you are looking to wash your dog by yourself. They layout for self-wash is good.

I called to inquire about grooming and was told that it includes a wash, nail trim, ear cleaning and haircut. I made my appointment 2 weeks in advance.\n\nWhen it was time for my appointment, I dropped my dog off and the groomer was not friendly at all. She just told me to lock my dog up in their cage. She didn't even take a second to ask me anything or talk to me since she was busy working with another dog. I left and waited, it took her 6 hours to call me back to pick my dog up. \n\nI had my friend pick up my dog since I couldn't. She paid the grooming fee plus tip. Once I saw my dog, it came to my surprise that his hair wasn't cut, nails weren't trimmed, and his left ear was super red. I called the groomer to voice my concern and instead of making it right with me, she made an excuse saying and I quote \""you should have clarified and said what you wanted done with your dog\"". I then said I didn't have a chance since she made it so hard to talk to her and I did mention what I wanted when I made the appointment (plus I shouldn't have to, I was informed that the grooming package included nail trim and hair cut so that's what I expected) and her response was, again I quote \""I don't remember every appointment I book!\"" how unprofessional!! Maybe you should write it down or at least be friendly enough to talk to your customers!\n\nTo make matters worse, my dog got an ear infection in his left ear which cost me $60.00 to treat. It was difficult trying to put the ear drops on my dog. After the 10 day treatment, the experience left my dog scared to be touched on his head and by his ears.\n\nIf you don't want to go through hell, DO NOT go here for grooming! You'll waste your money, be misinformed, not get the service you want, give trauma to your dog and be treated unprofessionally."

My group and I were drawn to this restaurant by its charming atmosphere and promising menu. We were not disappointed with the appetizers, as they were standouts of the evening. The caesar salad was crisp and flavorful and the antipasto platter was a hit with everyone at the table. However, our high expectations quickly diminished as we dug into our main courses. I ordered the lobster risotto, hoping for a decadent and creamy dish, but was met with a chewy and lackluster plate. My wife's chicken Parmesan tasted like a frozen TV dinner and my brother's orecchiette was only slightly better than average. Even the spaghetti with clams, a dish that is usually hard to mess up, fell short of our expectations. We were left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed by the main courses. The saving grace of the meal was the wonderful desserts, but sadly, even they could not make up for the lackluster entr√©es. Overall, our experience at this restaurant was subpar and we would not recommend it to others. With so many other options available in the area, we suggest trying somewhere else for your next meal."

My family and I recently visited this restaurant and were pleasantly surprised by the great family atmosphere. We have a 1-year-old and a 3.5-year-old, and have had no issues bringing them here. The wait time was minimal, except for one busy Friday night, which is to be expected.

The menu offers a variety of options, from fish to pasta to burgers, and everything we ordered was tasty. However, I do have to agree with a previous reviewer about the tight seating arrangements. There were times where we felt a bit too close to the table next to us, but the staff were always accommodating and helped us find a different spot.

One thing that didn't quite hit the mark for me were the cupcakes. I've tried them multiple times, hoping to find a favorite, but unfortunately, they just don't do it for me. They are more like muffins, and the frosting always seemed to be lacking in flavor.

Overall, I would recommend this restaurant for its delicious food and family-friendly ambiance. Just be prepared for some close quarters and maybe grab dessert elsewhere. "

This Starbucks location is conveniently located with plenty of parking options and even has an outdoor seating area. It's also conveniently located right next to a popular bagel shop!

On our recent visit to this restaurant after a long hiatus, we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. As new parents, we have been looking for convenient and delicious meals, and this place exceeded our expectations. The hummus was creamy and flavorful, and the gyros meat was perfectly seasoned and tender. We were also happy to see that they no longer have a buffet, as the food is much better when made fresh to order. The only thing that prevented us from giving this place a higher rating was the packaged pitas. Although warm and tasty, we couldn't help but imagine how much better they would be if they were made in-house. Additionally, we noticed that there was only one server working, which caused a bit of a delay in receiving our food and refills on drinks.

I recently had lunch at The Palm in Caesar's Forum Shops and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant has a charming outdoor cafe vibe thanks to its location in the mall. The staff was incredibly attentive and welcoming, which definitely added to the overall experience. I only had the lunch menu, but I can imagine the quality and taste would be even better for dinner or with one of their famous steaks. However, I have to dock some points because the ambiance was slightly ruined by the constant noise coming from the neighboring stores, which could be a bit overwhelming at times. Overall, The Palm is a solid choice in the Forum Shops for a nice meal, but perhaps its true potential can be fully appreciated during a dinner visit."
1213,I ordered two items for carry-out on 7/28/2013.  I was very disappointed in the quality of my food.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with chicken and cheese only and a ground beef taco with beef and cheese only.\n\nThey messed up both items.  They gave me a shredded chicken with tomatoes and onions in it and it was all liquidity.  Then they put lettuce on my taco.  The beef was burnt.  I took a bite of each item before throwing it all away.  The chips were stale and the salsa were bland and did not taste fresh at all!  What a waste of $15!

I visited this Indian restaurant over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the lunch buffet. While I've been a loyal customer of Maharaja for years, I have to say, this place might have won me over. The buffet had a variety of delicious dishes, including an amazing eggplant dish and a Tikki masala that was even better than Maharaja's. They even gave the option of regular or coconut Nan, and let me tell you, the coconut Nan was out of this world!

The tandoori chicken was also a standout - tender and flavorful, not at all dry like some places I've been to. And let's not forget the dessert options. The rice pudding and Mango Lassi were both top-notch. The only downside was the crowded space around the buffet, but the delicious food more than made up for it.

The staff was friendly and attentive, always making sure our plates and bowls were filled. However, I did notice that there were a few kinks to be ironed out, like ensuring there were enough plates and bowls available. But for a newer restaurant, I was thoroughly impressed with their offerings.

Plus, with Maharaja recently increasing their buffet prices on the weekends, this place is not only more affordable but also has better overall food. While there may be room for improvement, I will definitely be back to indulge in their tasty buffet again. "

Nobody came around to ask if everything was good, if we needed anything, or even to refill the water. \n\nWe finished, and waited 20 minutes. Tables around us that had finished earlier sat around full of empty plates and glasses. Dinner room looked like a bomb had gone off. Nobody came to clean them up. Finally, sick of waiting, I again got up to track down some help to pay the bill. \n\nAs we left, there was a large group of kids and adults in line outside waiting to get in, too bad the empty tables had been sitting full of dishes for half an hour, they all could have been sitting at a table, waiting for service by now instead of standing outside. \n\nI smiled on the way out, as I thought of the world of hurt everybody was in for."

We were excited to try this restaurant for breakfast during our stay at The Palazzo. However, our experience was anything but satisfying. Despite being one of the first customers to arrive, we were seated right away in the mostly empty restaurant. We figured we were just early, so we didn't think much of it.

But then came the food. We ordered a simple egg omelette and a plate of fruit. How can you mess that up, right? Apparently, this restaurant found a way. The eggs tasted like they came from a carton and the fruit was flavorless and had a strange texture. It was a huge disappointment.

The only saving grace was the service. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the outdoor seating area was lovely. But unfortunately, the food left much to be desired. It's a shame because the potential is there, but they really need to step up their game in the kitchen.

I hate to say it, but our experience here was easily one of the worst breakfasts we've ever had. We were hoping for a delicious and satisfying start to our day, but instead, we left feeling disappointed and still hungry. Don't make the same mistake we did and waste your money here. Trust me, there are much better breakfast options at The Palazzo."

""After having a terrible experience at this restaurant, I will never be returning. It was absolutely disgusting to find a worm in our food and see that the vegetables were old and clearly not fresh. On top of that, the entire place had a strong stench of cigarette smoke, making the dining experience even worse. It's unacceptable that a restaurant would serve such poor quality food and have such a strong odor permeating throughout. I wish I could give this place zero stars."""
1218,"Seafood tasted frozen. Roasted duck was pure grease and fat. The Cheese tasted like Kraft.\n\nThe Shu Mai was ok...\n\nI got sick...

1219,"I have to say I was very disappointed with my experience at the Kim vo Salon.  I went in for a pedicure.  I had called and booked my appt the day before.  The receptionist on the phone told me there were 3 different types - I picked the Lemongrass Bamboo.  I was really excited about my appt.  I had booked my appt to follow right after my massage at the spa.  My nail tech (Annie) came into the spa to get me.  She spoke broken English which was fine because I didnt wanna talk anyway.\nFirst off the room where they do the mani pedis is wonderful!  The chairs are fab!  \nI pick my color, get settled and my nail tech tells me there isnt a lemon pedi - just orange.  Ok strange orange isnt even on the menu.  Mind you this pedi is $95.\nShe informs me my feet are very dry - effen duh - we're in the desert Thats why I'm here!\nAll the other techs are giving their clients reccomendations for dinner and shows.  Mine tells me to go to an Asian Buffett off the strip!  WTF am I on candid camera!  \nWell anyway my feet were dry when I went in and they were dry when I came out."

I stumbled upon Desert Jade during a lunchtime craving for Chinese food and I'm so glad I did. Tucked away off Indian School, this little gem is a quiet and cozy spot to enjoy a delicious meal. The decor is refreshingly simple, with no tacky Buddha statues or waving cats in sight. 
The lunch menu offers a variety of tasty dishes at affordable prices. I opted for the sweet and sour pork with fried rice, and I was not disappointed. The flavors were rich and satisfying, and the portions were more than enough to fill me up. Plus, the fried rice was free of any random additions like bamboo shoots or bean sprouts - just simple and delicious. 
But the real hidden gem at Desert Jade is the hot tea. I'm not sure what kind it was, maybe green or ginger, but it was amazing even without sugar. And as a bonus, they also offer free hot tea with your meal. 
Overall, Desert Jade exceeded my expectations for a quick and inexpensive lunch spot. I appreciate that it's not over the top or trying too hard, just a cozy spot with great food. I'll definitely be back for more. "

I was in the mood for some Thai food and decided to try out Thai House based on their positive reviews. It was my first time ordering from them, but I had heard good things about their online ordering system. I placed my order on a Sunday evening and was pleasantly surprised by the quick and efficient delivery. The chicken pad thai was flavorful with a nice balance of sweet and spicy, just like the reviews had mentioned. I also couldn't resist ordering the fried bananas for dessert, and they did not disappoint. The online ordering system was easy to use, with pictures of the dishes and options for customization. However, I did notice that the prices were a bit higher than other Thai restaurants I've been to. Overall, the food was delicious and the online ordering system was convenient, but I do wish the prices were a bit more reasonable."
1222,If it is important to do to make your flight by relying on an airport shuttle do not stay here.     \n\nI thought the 45 minute wait for the shuttle last night at the airport to get here is bad this morning is ridiculous \n\nI was in the lobby at 915 waiting for the 930 shuttle when I was told there would not be one till 10 am.  Well I just  watched the 10 o'clock leave  at 950 with one person on it with 8 of us still sitting in the lobby.   \n\nThe girls said they will be at 10:15 now.   \n\nWhy is it supposed to run every half hour we need to get the airport to make flights. \n\nThis is ridiculous I don't know who manages here but they have problems.
1223,"My friend and I were pretty excited when we discovered this place (only boba place in an 8 mile radius, chyyyeaaaaa - okay totally an exaggeration but you know how it is) \nHowever, after taking a look at the way the tea was prepared, I was completely turned off. Powder. Open jugs of jellies. Blechhh...Still, I wanted to give the tea a try, so I ordered a plane black tea with lychee jelly because I didn't want to risk ordering any milk tea combo. \n\nFirst, I cant believe I paid $4 and change for some tea and jelly - it probably cost them less than 25 cents to make. Second, the service was a complete mess. My drink took more than 15 minutes to prepare, and I'm pretty sure I got my order before some patrons who had placed their order before me. Finally, the tea was okay - but it definitely tasted like it was brewed from a tea bag. I think the jelly was the best part, but jelly is jelly - if they had managed to mess up the jelly, I would have been extremely worried. \n\nI like the concept of the place, but Steepery will need to clean up its act and rethink its pricing strategy before I'm back!"
1224,I took my daughter to KFC and it was shocking how the uniforms were so dirty at 10:30 am when they just opened and no reason to be dirty.

Based off of cleanliness it would be no stars.

Not sure if I just had bad luck or if Barry Manilow is really that popular, but I couldn't even enjoy the amazing offer for free rooms because the show was already sold out. And trust me, I tried calling right away as soon as I received the offer ‚Äì no luck. It was a major letdown, to say the least. What's worse, when I showed my friend the offer, they couldn't help but laugh at the irony of it all.

To make matters worse, the hotel itself didn't really leave a positive impression on me. The last time I stayed there, everything just seemed so worn and shabby compared to the newer, more modern hotels like the Cosmopolitan. It's not just about the offer being a bust, it's about the overall experience.

But hey, maybe it's just my bad luck. Maybe if I had actually been able to see Barry Manilow live, things would have been different. Maybe I wouldn't have noticed the outdated rooms and dull atmosphere. Maybe I would have been so caught up in singing along to ""Mandy"" and ""Copacabana"" that none of that would have mattered.

But alas, I'll never know. All I can say is that this experience has definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. Next time, I'll stick to booking a room at the newer, more impressive hotels on the strip. Sorry, Paris, but you just didn't make the cut this time."
1226,"I went here recently for dinner with my family and about 5 minutes after our appetizer arrived so did our dinner so we didn't even get a chance to enjoy our first round. The steak I ordered was way undercooked when I asked for medium well, It was so red it was dripping.  Our server was very nice about the situation but it was the manager that had an attitude.  The manager explained to me that medium well takes a long time to cook and that's why my new steak was taking so long.. Of course I know that it takes a long time. That's why I was surprised it came out so quick. Terrible service from the manager and I won't be returning."

My husband and I stumbled upon Yashas on a whim while searching for a place to have a nice dinner. Initially, we were a bit hesitant as it seemed like a ""hole in the wall"" kind of place. But to our surprise, the interior was actually quite charming and welcoming. The owner greeted us warmly and made us feel right at home. We perused the menu and were pleased to find a good variety of eastern European meats, a pleasant surprise as my wife was looking for some items she used to eat as a child. And to our delight, they actually had the items she was craving and they were even open on Memorial Day!

We decided to share a few dishes, and each one was tasty and satisfying. The Mici, a childhood favorite of my wife's, was cooked to perfection and brought back fond memories. We also tried some of the bakery items, which were simply divine. The diverse selection of meats in the freezer caught my eye, and I made a mental note to come back to try them.

Unfortunately, our dining experience was dampened by one thing - the lack of air conditioning. It was an unusually hot day, and the lack of cool air made it a bit uncomfortable to fully enjoy our meal. We also noticed that some of the furniture looked a bit worn and could use some updating. But overall, the food and friendly service more than made up for these minor inconveniences.

Overall, we had a decent dining experience at Yashas. While there were a few hiccups, the good food and warm service made up for them. We will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu and hopefully, they have some AC by then!"

My experience at this buffet was quite disappointing. I had high expectations after reading all the rave reviews, but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The price was quite steep for what was offered, and the food itself was nothing extraordinary. The dessert bar may have had a wide selection, but the quality of the items was subpar. I personally prefer the more affordable buffets such as Ballys or New Orleans buffet. 
The service was also lacking. Despite there being signs instructing guests to check in with the hostess, I was met with a surly and unhelpful response when I asked for clarification. The lack of good service only added to my disappointment with this place. 
Overall, I would not recommend this buffet. Perhaps it was just an off night for them, but my experience was far from impressive. I have had much better dining experiences at a local place in Pasadena, CA that serves a similar buffet. It's a shame that even though this place is run by a celebrity chef, it fell short in terms of taste and value. "

I was looking for a quick and casual spot to grab a bite to eat while exploring the city, and stumbled upon this burger joint. I had no prior knowledge of the place, so I walked in with no expectations or bias. The prices were reasonable, and for an additional charge, you could upgrade to ""fat fries"" (aka steak fries), which was a nice touch. They also had unique burger add-ons, such as a fried egg, which I don't see at many places. 

The atmosphere was simple and laid-back, which was perfect for a burger joint. The burger itself was good, definitely better than fast food chains like McDonald's and Burger King. I also appreciated the fact that they used quality ingredients. However, it wasn't the best burger I've ever had. It was just okay. 

In terms of the service, our waiter was friendly but seemed a bit overwhelmed. We had to wait a while for our drinks and check, which was a bit frustrating. 

Overall, the burger was satisfying and hit the spot, but I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had. It was a decent option for a quick meal while out and about, but I've had better burgers at other places. It's worth a try, but don't expect it to blow your mind."

I'm sticking with Costco from now on into forever!"
1231,"This buffet is definitely a waste of time and money.   We waited for over an hour in line, only to go in there and see that over half the tables were empty.  Completely empty.  With a line still snaking around the thing.  \n\nI realize that there are VIP guests who can march on through, but come on, there were empty seats ALL OVER!   We arrived at 8pm, and didn't get seated until after 9, when theoretically, we could have been seated within 20-30 minutes.  We were in a mad rush; they don't add more food at 10, and start packin' things up at 10:30.\n\nThere is a wide selection of food, but your money is better spent at Le Village (like someone else pointed out), or at the Spice Market Buffet (in the Planet Hollywood)."

I've been a loyal customer of Griffin Brothers for years now, but my recent experience left me feeling disappointed. I had made an appointment for my vehicle inspection and dropped off my car at 8am. However, I was surprised and frustrated to find out that my car was not ready by 11:30am. When I called to inquire about the delay, I was informed that dropping off my car instead of waiting for it would result in a longer wait time. This doesn't make any sense to me, especially since I made an appointment in advance.

Although I still trust Griffin Brothers for their high-quality service, this experience has caused me to lower my rating from 5 stars to 3. The car inspection itself may have been done well, but the lack of efficient customer service has left a sour taste in my mouth. I hope that the management takes note of this issue and makes improvements in the future. It's a shame to see a great service provider fall short in terms of customer satisfaction. Perhaps they should consider hiring more staff or implementing a better system for appointments to ensure a smoother experience for their customers. "

We were extremely disappointed with our experience at this buffet. Beware, the selection is extremely limited and the quality of the food is mediocre at best. Our group was in a rush, as we were trying to visit as many buffets as possible before our pass expired. This buffet was a last resort and now we know why. The service was terrible, with our waitress disappearing for extended periods of time. And don't even get me started on the supposed ""sushi"" section. It was nothing more than fake crab and stale salmon and tuna rolls. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this buffet altogether. Oh, and the only slightly redeeming factor was the view of the flamingo garden, but that's definitely not enough to make up for the subpar food and service."

I was excited to try out Sambalatte based on all the rave reviews I had read online. However, my experience was far from pleasant. Firstly, the atmosphere was nothing like what was described - it felt old and rundown. As for the staff, they were far from friendly and helpful. My order was completely messed up and when I politely explained the situation, the manager refused to correct it and also charged me for items I didn't even order. To make matters worse, my food had a massive amount of hair in it and was overall disappointing. I was shocked at the lack of customer service displayed by the manager and it's a shame because the coffee itself was decent. But the poor service and unsanitary conditions have completely turned me off from ever returning. I guess it's back to the search for a good coffee joint. What a disappointment."

My friends and I decided to give this restaurant a try last week and I have to say, it was a major disappointment. Despite the fact that I have food allergies, I was willing to give them a chance because of the great reviews. However, I quickly learned that this was a huge mistake. The staff was not accommodating at all and seemed to have too much attitude for a restaurant that is supposed to be known for its excellent service.

I made two trips to this place, hoping to try the burger that supposedly won a contest by Bobby Flay. But both times, I was told that it was not available. The first time, I brushed it off as bad timing. But the second time, I was specifically told that I couldn't get a seat for at least two hours, even though there were many empty tables and no reservations booked. To make matters worse, the staff had such a rude and dismissive attitude when delivering this news. They clearly think they are so important and above their customers.

I will never attempt to eat here again. This restaurant has clearly gotten too big for its britches and their arrogance and lack of consideration for their customers is unacceptable. I would highly advise others to steer clear of this place. Trust me, you won't be missing out on anything special. There are plenty of other great restaurants in the area that actually appreciate and value their customers."
1237,"FastMed? More like SlowMed. This is hands down the worst experience I have ever had with an Urgent Care. The only reason I went is because I received notification that my doctor had left my service network last week. The place had me wait over two hours to see a \""doctor\"" who then said he had no clue what was going on with me. He recommended to take a medication that I actually saw at CVS myself--same exact milligram dosage as well. Not only is the doctor inept (if he is a doctor at all), but I actually think a paperclip is smarter than the staff. They are rude as well, and I actually saw a girl essentially begging to pay the receptionist for her medication when I got in as she stood there for 20 minutes. By the look on her face, she had probably been waiting there since sunrise. \n\nThis place is about as useful as a wet piece of bread. If you are in serious need of urgent care, you would be better off watching a \""do it yourself\"" video on youtube than go to this joke of a place."

I really had high hopes for this restaurant, especially with all the great reviews and its location in a charming Italian spot. But unfortunately, my experience was far from charming. First off, we had a reservation for 7:30pm and arrived at 7:25, only to be told that our table wasn't ready. After waiting outside in sweltering heat until AFTER 8pm, we were finally seated. What made this situation even worse was that the hostess didn't even bother to offer us a drink or dessert for the inconvenience. And let's not forget that it was one of the hottest days on record. Not a good first impression.

Moving on to the food, we shared the scallops as a first course and they were decent, but definitely not worth the price. My snapper bordetto was overcooked and my husband's lamb pappardelle was just average. And to top it off, our waitress seemed new and unprepared, which resulted in slow and subpar service. The bartender even had to refill our water glasses because our waitress was nowhere to be seen. We thought about getting dessert, but after waiting 10 minutes for the dessert menu and another 10 for her to check back, we decided to just call it a night.

If I were to ever return, which I highly doubt, I would definitely sit at the bar. Their cocktail menu looked impressive. But overall, I think this restaurant is a disservice to its charming location and I can't imagine that it will survive for much longer. Save your money and go elsewhere for a better dining experience. "
1239,"Read a lot of positive reviews, so we decided to give it a shot on the morning of my birthday. We ordered several things like the happy, fat kids we are. The waffle sandwich, breakfast burrito, half croissant with fruit and crumbles on top, and a cronut.\n\nLets start with the good. The croissant was very tasty. The servers were friendly and the atmosphere was quaint and inviting. They were nice enough to bring out a honey bun with a candle in it for my birthday. If I could give them 3.5 stars I would.\n\nNow the not so good. We had to clean off our own table because it was covered in crumbs. We had never had a cronut (croissant/donut) before, so why not. Nothing special. Honestly, I would prefer a regular donut over a cronut any day of the week. The breakfast burrito was bland, not much flavor at all. Expected big things from the waffle sandwich. \""A\"" for presentation, but \""C\"" for taste. Just like the burrito, extremely bland. Add some spices and it has a ton of potential.\n\nDebating on whether or not to return. Saw a breakfast pizza come out to the table next to us, which looked interesting. We shall see..."

My friends and I stumbled upon Rum Runners during Superbowl weekend 2014. Looking for a local spot to watch the game and enjoy some good food without the crazy prices and fake atmosphere of the touristy places, we decided to give this place a try. And boy, were we pleasantly surprised.

First off, the staff at Rum Runners was amazing. They were friendly, welcoming, and made us feel right at home. Shannon, in particular, went above and beyond to ensure that we had a great experience. And the food...oh man, the food was fantastic. We couldn't resist trying the blackened wings and let me tell you, they were out of this world. And the burgers? Well, the smell alone from the parking lot was enough to draw us in, and we were not disappointed. Delicious and reasonably priced, we couldn't resist ordering more to take home with us.

But what really set Rum Runners apart from the other places we've been to in Vegas was the genuine and down-to-earth atmosphere. This wasn't some fancy overpriced joint trying to impress with gimmicks. This was a local spot, attached to a great little restaurant, where the staff and customers all felt like one big family. They even gave out free promotional t-shirts and other goodies throughout the night, adding to the fun and welcoming vibe.

Overall, Rum Runners exceeded our expectations and is now our go-to spot whenever we're in Vegas. If you want to experience true local hospitality while indulging in some delicious food and drinks, do yourself a favor and head over to Rum Runners. Trust me, you won't regret it. Thank you to the amazing staff for making our Superbowl weekend truly memorable. You guys rock!"

My recent visit to this LA fitness location left me with mixed feelings. On one hand, the gym itself was decent - nothing impressive, but had all the basic equipment I needed. The location was convenient for me, being only 10 miles away. However, my experience in the men's locker room was nothing short of unpleasant. The overpowering stench that hit me as soon as I entered was almost unbearable. And it wasn't just a one-time thing - I've been here at different times of the day and the smell was always there. It's a shame because I do prefer to work out in the mornings and this just ruins my whole workout experience. The lack of cleanliness in such an important area is a major turn off for me. Honestly, I'm surprised that this has not been addressed by the management. I understand that gyms can get crowded and messy, but that doesn't excuse the bad odor. I will have to consider going to the next closest location for my workouts. Hopefully, they have better air fresheners there."

We were in the mood for some good Hawaiian food, so we decided to give Aloha Kitchen a try. The reviews seemed promising and we were excited to see a mix of Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean dishes on the menu.

The highlights of the meal were definitely the chicken katsu and kalua pig plates. They were served with generous portions of fluffy rice and creamy mac salad, just like back home. We also enjoyed the Teriyaki combo and the Kalbi combo, filled with different meats and flavors.

However, we did have a few disappointments. The menu was quite large and we were excited to try some of the other options, like poke and saimin. But unfortunately, they didn't quite live up to our expectations. They were tasty, but lacked that extra something that would make us want to come back for more.

The Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, on the other hand, was a standout. The pork adobo combined with rice and garlic, all wrapped up in an omelette, was absolutely delicious. We couldn't get enough of it!

While the food was satisfying, we did notice that the presentation was simple and no-frills. But hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing when you're craving some good comfort food. And speaking of comfort, the Aloha Bar next door is the perfect place to relax and have some drinks after a meal. Just be prepared for some interesting karaoke performances.

Overall, we had a decent experience at Aloha Kitchen. The food was good, the portion sizes were generous, and the prices were reasonable. However, it didn't quite live up to the rave reviews we had read. We may consider returning, especially for that Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, but we're not in a rush like we were for our birthday brunch earlier this year."

I had high hopes when I decided to give this theater another chance, but unfortunately, I was met with disappointment after disappointment. Let's start with the prices ‚Äì outrageous. I mean, come on, these tickets cost more than my Netflix subscription. And for what? Movies that have been out for ages. I understand that everyone's trying to make a profit, but this just feels like a slap in the face to loyal customers like myself. As if the ticket prices weren't bad enough, my nephew and I were greeted with a long line, understaffed by only 2 employees, on a scorching hot day. Why do they insist on making us stand in the heat instead of investing in more staff? Speaking of investing, the ticket kiosk was clearly not worth the money. After enduring the torturous heat and finally getting inside, we were met with yet another line at the concession stand. And what do you know, the line was moving at a snail's pace because, surprise surprise, they were short-staffed. But the icing on the cake was the experience in the bathroom ‚Äì one of the worst experiences of my life, and believe me, I've had some bad ones. It was dirty, smelly, and the toilets didn't even flush properly. I felt like I needed a hazmat suit just to use the facilities. And here's the cherry on top, I was charged 100 dollars for 2 tickets, thanks to their faulty ticket machine. And instead of offering a solution, their clueless manager acted like I was bothering her by asking for help. Of course, they're no strangers to this issue, but they continue to do nothing about it, leaving us to deal with the consequences of their incompetence. Thank goodness I was able to get the charges reversed, but the fact that I had to waste 3 hours of my life on the phone with my bank because of this theater is unacceptable. Save yourself the trouble and just wait for the movie to come out on DVD or hit up a Redbox or Blockbuster for some reasonably priced snacks. Trust me, you'll thank me later."

I had been meaning to try out this car wash for a while now, especially since I saw online that they offer hand wash services. However, my first impression was not a good one. I waited in line for a while, only to see someone who had arrived after me being taken care of first. Not a great start. 

And unfortunately, things didn't get much better from there. I was surprised to find out that they don't even carry windshield wiper fluid. Isn't that a basic necessity for a car wash? I ended up having to go to another place just to get some. 

The service itself was a disappointment as well. While I had come here specifically for a hand wash, my car ended up going through a regular mechanical car wash. I was hoping for a more thorough and careful wash, but instead my car got stuck in their equipment. Thankfully, there was no damage, but it was still concerning. 

To top it off, after I had been waiting for 20 minutes for my car to be dried and wiped down, I realized that it had just been sitting on their ""carousel"" with no one actually working on it. It seemed like they were either understaffed or too busy to attend to each car in a timely manner. Which is understandable, but it would have been nice to know that beforehand. 

In the end, I wouldn't recommend this car wash. It's not the ""hand wash"" experience they advertise and the lack of attention to detail and slow service was frustrating. I'd rather just do it myself next time."

I recently ordered take-out from this Chinese restaurant and overall, my experience was decent. The staff was friendly and my food was ready earlier than expected, which was a pleasant surprise. However, the dishes I ordered were a bit lackluster in terms of flavor and quality. While the portion sizes were generous, the taste of the dishes just didn't live up to my expectations. It was good, but not great. Additionally, I couldn't help but notice the patio area as I walked in, and it did seem like a nice spot to dine in. Perhaps eating in-person would have enhanced the overall experience. On the bright side, the prices were reasonable, so I didn't feel like I wasted my money.

As we left, I couldn't help but think about how the empty tables filled with dirty plates and glasses were a reflection of the service we received during our visit. With no one coming around to check on us or refill our water, we were left feeling neglected and overlooked. Despite the friendly staff and clean facility, I wouldn't recommend returning to Kneaders anytime soon."

I was excited to try out the food at this bowling alley, especially since I had heard great things about their cosmic bowling. However, my experience was far from great. I ordered a burger and fries and was extremely disappointed with what came out. The burger was cold and resembled a hockey puck more than a patty. The fries were soggy and lacked any flavor. I couldn't believe the high price I paid for such poor quality food. And to top it off, I had to wait forever for my order to even come out. It was clear that the kitchen was not functioning efficiently that night. I couldn't help but wonder if there was a new cook in the kitchen, causing all these issues. Whatever the reason, my experience was disappointing and I won't be returning for food any time soon. Stick to just bowling and skip the food here."
1251,"Dropped in today because I was in the mood for a Gyro and wanted to try someplace different than my usual Nero's stop. \n\nI will not be returning. \n\nThe gyro was overpriced, not particularly flavorful, and the fries were... just fries. I could get them from anywhere. Not what I'd expect from a meal running $12 with drink. \n\nThe entire time I was in there I was the only customer. Now I know why."

We decided to make a stop at this bar during our evening out. The atmosphere was lively and we were greeted by the ponytailed bartender, Jummy. We chose to sit at the bar since it wasn't too crowded. However, we soon realized that Jummy was the only one working the entire bar area. We waited for a while to be served, but then another group walked in and Jummy immediately attended to their needs. We waited patiently, but eventually had to approach the bar ourselves to get his attention. He seemed a bit preoccupied and didn't seem to have much of a smile on his face. After a few minutes, we asked to be seated in the dining area instead.

It took quite some time for our waitress to come and take our orders. We started off with the she crab and French onion soup as appetizers, which were recommended by the bartender. The she crab was amazing, but the onion soup was just average. We were only able to take a few bites before our main course arrived. We had ordered the fish and chips to split, but they were not as fresh as we had hoped. The fish was good, but the chips were soggy and cold. Luckily, we noticed that the wings were a popular item among other diners, as they seemed to be the best deal of the day.

As we were paying our bill, we were disappointed to realize that we had been overcharged. We kindly brought this to Jummy's attention, but he seemed defensive and asked for more tip money. We assured him that we had already left a tip, but he abruptly grabbed our beers and told us to leave. Needless to say, we were taken aback by his behavior and will not be returning to this establishment. We suggest you count your change if you do choose to visit and stay away from the ""crazy man"" behind the bar."

I've been to this restaurant multiple times before and always left satisfied, so I was excited to bring my friends here for a big group dinner. Unfortunately, our experience this time was completely different. Despite being the only customers in the restaurant, we waited an entire hour before our food was served. When the waiter finally brought our plates out, they seemed rushed and inattentive. To add insult to injury, 15 minutes later, the waiter asked us if we were done and ready to pay. Talk about poor service.

On the bright side, the food was still decent. We ordered a variety of dishes to share, including the chicken fajitas and the shrimp scampi, both of which were flavorful and well-cooked. The plating and presentation, however, left much to be desired. And while some dishes were hits, others were just okay. The pizzas were a bit too greasy for my taste, and the salad was drenched in dressing. Overall, the food was nothing spectacular.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was also a disappointment. The decor was outdated and the lighting was too bright for a cozy dinner. The lack of ambiance made it feel like more of a cafeteria than a restaurant. Although the big screen TVs were a nice touch, they didn't make up for the lackluster atmosphere.

All in all, I was disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. While the food was decent, the slow and careless service, combined with the lackluster atmosphere, was a major letdown. I don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon. "

Okay, I have to be honest here. Chens is not the best Chinese food I've ever had. In fact, it's pretty mediocre. I've been to quite a few Chinese restaurants, and Chens definitely falls towards the bottom of the list. But hey, I guess it's better than nothing when you're in the mood for some quick Chinese food and you don't want to venture too far from home. Trust me, I've been there.

The atmosphere is chaotic and can definitely be overwhelming at times. It's almost like a combat zone in the evenings. And let's not even get started on how impossible it is to keep clean with all the people coming in and out. It can get a little steamy and dishroom-esque, if you catch my drift.

Now, here's the thing. The employees are not exactly the most friendly or welcoming bunch. I've heard rumors that some of them may not even be US citizens. But that's not really any of my business, I suppose. What I do know is that the food tastes like something you'd find in a USMC chow hall on a particularly bad day. It's not great, but I'm sure some people might find it comforting in a weird way.

All that being said, I will give this place two stars for one reason and one reason only. They give free meals to veterans on Veterans Day. And as a veteran myself, I can appreciate that gesture. But other than that, I'll stick to P.F Changs or Pei Wei for my Chinese food fix. They may not be as close, but the quality is definitely worth the extra drive."

My friends and I decided to order take-out from this place after hearing mixed reviews. We figured we'd give it a try and see for ourselves. The food was alright, nothing to write home about. But the real kicker was the bartender. Wow, what a jerk. We didn't feel like eating at the restaurant so we opted for take-out, but apparently that's not good enough for him. He made a whole scene about not getting a tip for just walking over with our food. Last time I checked, a tip is for good service. And let me tell you, he definitely didn't provide that. Our food was freshly cooked but cold by the time we opened it five minutes later. I get that they were probably busy, but isn't it part of the bartender's job to make sure the food stays hot on its way out? Not impressed with the service at all. Maybe if we had eaten there instead, it would have been a different experience. But based on that interaction, I doubt we'll be back."

Our recent visit to this Sammy's was a pleasant experience overall. The cozy atmosphere and friendly staff made us feel right at home. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and even went above and beyond to try and accommodate our request for a dish that was no longer listed. We appreciated the effort. 

The gluten-free garlic shrimp pizza was a hit at our table. The crust was crispy and the garlicky flavor was on point. However, we were a bit disappointed when we asked for the green peppers to be omitted from our pizza and were told that the toppings were ""premixed"" and couldn't be altered. This left us wondering what other menu options were also ""premixed"". Despite this, we still enjoyed the pizza and simply picked off the peppers. 

One highlight of our meal was the messy sundae for dessert. It was the perfect combination of sweet and indulgent. And as a bonus, the restaurant offers iced tea in pitchers, which we appreciated as we kept refilling our glasses throughout the meal. 

The only downside was the lack of interest in the game we were trying to watch. Being from Boston, we were hoping to catch the Sox game while we were 1000 miles away from home. While there initially didn't seem to be much interest from the crowd, by the end of the game there were more people paying attention. Overall, a solid experience with good food, great service, and a decent game-watching crowd. We would definitely consider coming back."

I have to share my disappointment with Giacomo's. I've been there a few times now and each time, I have ordered the whole wheat pasta. I mean, come on, it's supposed to be homemade and healthy, right? Wrong. Despite multiple requests for al dente pasta, my dish always ends up overcooked and lacking in flavor.

I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it's time for me to leave a review. Why is it so hard for them to cook pasta properly? And at $18 a dish, I expect more than just pre-cooked pasta and some store-bought sauce. It's a shame that there aren't many other options in this area because I refuse to keep paying for subpar pasta every time I dine out.

I've even called to complain, but it falls on deaf ears. Maybe other customers are actually complaining about their pasta being undercooked? Hard to imagine. Either way, I've learned my lesson. I'll stick to making my own pasta at home with ingredients from Whole Foods. Sorry for the lengthy rant, but I can't help but wonder why we don't have a good Italian restaurant like Giacomo's of Boston here in Phoenix. "

I must say, I had high hopes for this place after hearing good things from friends. But after my experience here, I can confidently say I will never eat here again. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that the restaurant lacked attention to detail. The silverware on our table was visibly dirty and the menus were sticky. Not exactly the best start.

To make matters worse, our server, Jose, was incredibly rude and seemed to have no knowledge about the menu. When we ordered a half bottle of wine, he didn't even bother presenting us with the cork and asked if we wanted to taste it instead. Isn't it standard protocol to present and taste the wine before serving? Clearly, Jose was not trained properly.

The food itself was a disappointment as well. The lump crab artichoke dip was decent, but definitely needed more salt. The real disaster, however, was the lobster bisque. It came out looking like a mustard yellow mess with only a few small pieces of lobster floating in it. And to make matters worse, the flavor was just plain awful. I couldn't even finish it.

Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse, our server asked me how I wanted my prime rib cooked. As someone who has had their fair share of prime rib, I know that it's always served rare to medium rare. I couldn't believe that they were actually giving me a choice.

But here's the real kicker. If you want the $30 three course meal, you can only choose from a limited selection of items, including a small steak or some kind of chicken. And don't even get me started on the dessert options.

Overall, I was extremely dissatisfied with my experience at this restaurant. The lack of attention to detail, rude service, and subpar food have left a bad taste in my mouth. I regret ever setting foot in this place and I will never make the mistake of coming back. Trust me, there are plenty of other restaurants in the area that value their customers and know how to serve a decent meal. Avoid this place at all costs."

I recently reached out to Scott for some much needed ceiling and wall repair in my home, and I have to say, I am thoroughly impressed. From start to finish, he made the process easy and stress-free. His communication was efficient and straight to the point, and his pricing was very reasonable. I sent him some photos of the repairs needed, and within a short timeframe, he sent me a quote and a phone number to schedule an appointment. And let me tell you, his work speaks for itself. The repairs he did were flawless and he left my home looking as good as new. Not only that, but his attention to detail and cleanliness during the process was top-notch. I was also pleasantly surprised that he was able to schedule me in rather quickly, which was a huge bonus for my busy schedule. Overall, if you need any sort of home repairs, I highly recommend giving Scott a call. He may not be the most talkative person, but his work speaks volumes. I know I'll be calling him for all my future home repair needs."

1261,"I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so."

Review: My husband has a soft spot for Fatburger, so when we saw one on the strip during our Vegas trip, we just had to stop in. Unfortunately, our visit left us feeling a little underwhelmed. First off, the space was pretty small and not very clean, which is a bit of a turn off when it comes to food. And even though there weren't many people there, the wait for our food was longer than expected, probably because each order is made fresh. On the plus side, my husband said his Fat King burger with an egg was delicious and definitely lived up to the typical Fatburger standard. I opted not to order anything, so I can't speak for the rest of the menu. But on a positive note, we did meet a lovely family from Utah while we waited. Overall, I wouldn't say our experience was anything special, but it wasn't terrible either. It's your standard fast food burger joint with a lot of young workers. While we probably won't make a special trip to Fatburger on our next Vegas visit, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up stopping by again. "

It's plastic but rest assured, I'll save it. \n\nMeh. Hopefully I caught them at the end of the night on winter break."

I was really looking forward to trying this place based on the hype and good reviews, but man was I disappointed. First of all, the place was practically empty, which should have been a red flag. Our server was friendly, but her lack of English skills made it difficult to communicate. And let's talk about the food. The texican chicken salad sounded amazing, but it was just...bland. The dressing was a sad excuse for chipotle ranch and didn't add any flavor. And the fried pickles? Yikes. I couldn't even finish them because they were so salty. I swear, my blood pressure probably spiked just from one bite. The only saving grace was the local beer selection. I tried the Noda Jam Session and it was pretty good. But overall, this place left me feeling like a disappointed parent. I may not be a dad, but I was definitely a sad daddy after this meal. Save your money and avoid this place."

I got there and sat for over 15 minutes while a man kept running by me saying \""I'll go check on your food, I'll go check on your food\"".

I had high hopes for Bacon with a name like that, but unfortunately, I was let down. After two visits, I can confidently say that their title dish is nothing special. My bacon was lukewarm, dry, and lacking any real flavor - it was like eating tree bark. Despite ordering cheese on my eggs, it was missing when my dish arrived. The server did bring it back to the kitchen, but when it came back, it was just a few measly shreds of cold cheese on top. Not what I would expect from a $15 breakfast. \n\nTo top it off, the service was mediocre at best. The server didn't offer any solutions when I mentioned that my dish was just ""alright."" With such a basic, overpriced breakfast, I expected better service. \n\nI had hoped that Bacon would live up to its name, but sadly, that is not the case. There are many other places in Scottsdale that offer a better breakfast experience. Until I hear of some changes, I won't be returning to Bacon. I would suggest checking out The Breakfast Club, Cafe Carumba, or Matt's Big Breakfast instead. "

We decided to check out Copper Star after hearing about it from a friend. It seemed like a great place to relax and catch up over some coffee. I was particularly excited to try their almond latte, as I had heard good things about it. The atmosphere inside was cozy and inviting, with various groups of people enjoying their drinks and conversations. We chose to sit outside on the patio, taking advantage of the beautiful weather.

While my latte was decent, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. It lacked that extra kick I was hoping for and left me wishing I had gone for the massage instead. On the bright side, the highlight of my visit was surprisingly the bathroom. I know, it's a weird thing to point out, but I'm a bit of a bathroom connoisseur and this one definitely impressed me. The blue tiling and unique faucet added a nice touch to the space.

Sadly, my latte wasn't the only thing that fell short during our visit. The red velvet cupcakes caught my eye, but I resisted the temptation. However, upon seeing them up close, I regretted not giving in. They looked absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, our server didn't quite meet our expectations either. She seemed a bit disinterested and never came by to ask if we wanted a refill or anything else.

All in all, Copper Star had its ups and downs. I may return to try a different drink and perhaps indulge in a cupcake, but I hope for better service and a stronger latte next time. It's a shame they lacked consistency in all aspects, especially with such a great concept and potential."

I recently dined at this restaurant with a group of friends and our experience was just okay. We were able to get a table right away on a busy Saturday night, but unfortunately, things went downhill from there. Despite being seated promptly, we sat for 15 minutes without any server approaching our table. It was obvious that the staff was not well-trained and the service was sub par. It was a bit of a let down considering the reputation of the restaurant.
However, what really stood out to me was the quality of the meat. I'm no steak expert, but I do know that the quality of the meat is crucial. The steak here was good, but nothing exceptional. The waiters were quick to give it high praise, but I found it to be a bit lacking. The meat looked a bit thin and definitely not what I was expecting.
On a positive note, the dessert was excellent. It was the highlight of our meal and definitely worth trying. But overall, our experience at this restaurant was just average. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place unless you're not expecting much. It's a shame because with a little more attention to detail and training, this place could really shine. "

I stopped by this pharmacy with my prescription in hand, hoping for a quick and easy pickup. But instead, I was met with nothing but frustration and disappointment. After a long wait, I was finally informed that they no longer accepted my insurance. No effort was made to let me know beforehand or even offer suggestions for other local pharmacies. And to make matters worse, when I asked for my prescription back, I was treated like a criminal. They refused to give it back and I was forced to give in and pay out of pocket. I'll never make the mistake of visiting this dishonest establishment again. Don't waste your time or money here, I highly recommend heading to the CVS just down the street at 6391 West Lake Mead Boulevard for a better experience. Trust me, it's worth the extra few minutes of driving."

I stopped by this spot on a Thursday night around 10pm, excited to finally try their famous shaved ice with fruit topping that I saw all over social media. However, what I experienced was far from satisfying. Although the place was packed, it was much smaller than I expected, more comparable to Tea Station. But I have to admit, the food on the menu looked appetizing from what I saw around me. Sadly, I didn't get the chance to try any of it because my Thai tea was way too sweet. And to make matters worse, our server seemed to struggle with her English, even though I've been to countless places around China Town and this was nothing new to me. But what really left a bad taste in my mouth was when the owner yelled at the members of our party who were trying to pay with card, stating that they only accepted cash or transactions over $10. I understand that this may be a common rule in this area, but at least have a sign or inform your customers beforehand. No need for the unnecessary yelling. And honestly, if it wasn't for my craving for that shave ice and those cute curvy straws in a jar, I don't think I would come back here. Disappointing first impression, but maybe we'll give it another shot."

The lychee drink- soooo good. \n\nService amazing- just fantastic.\n\nOverall I think its worth trying this place- I came here to experience something new and I enjoyed my experience.

The last straw was a confirmation for an early morning appointment that I received at 10pm the night before.  I didn't read it until the next morning, honestly because a text a 10pm is RUDE to me unless you are a family member or a close friend.  I texted in the morning to reschedule and I was told 'I was being inconvenient'  Really?  A long standing customer (over 8 months) rescheduling ONCE, when you have rescheduled on me a number of times is inconvenient?  I told them not to bother I would find another facility.  They are great at what they do, but honestly unless you can work around them and their schedule, don't bother."

My experience at this store was absolutely awful. I was in a rush and needed to grab some last-minute items for a trip, so I stopped by this store since it was conveniently located next to Wal-Mart. Big mistake. As soon as I walked in, I was hit with a terrible odor that lingered throughout the entire store. I tried to ignore it and continue browsing, but it just kept getting worse. 

I finally found the strip-lashes that I needed and, to my dismay, they were completely crushed and misshapen. It was clear that they had been previously opened and mishandled. The staff seemed completely uninterested and unwilling to help me find a new package that wasn't damaged. 

I also decided to grab some groceries while I was there, but unfortunately, they were not up to par. The produce was old and wilted, and some of the items were past their expiration date. It was clear that the store had not been properly stocked or maintained. 

Overall, this store was a huge disappointment. The staff were unhelpful and the products were subpar. I will not be returning to this store and I strongly recommend that others avoid it as well. Save yourself the hassle and go to a different store, trust me. "

I used to frequent this spot quite often, but lately I haven't been back as much. It's your typical sports bar, which is great if you're a fan of the Packers. But for me, it doesn't really stand out from other bars in the area. 

On the positive side, they have some amazing deals here. I mean, $2.25 for a build-your-own burger? Yes, please! And their selection of cheap big beers is definitely a plus. I also love their random $1 shots of Schnapps - always a fun surprise. And if you're feeling adventurous, you can even try some tasty dishes from the nearby Badger Cafe. As for entertainment, they have some old-school coin operated games, shuffleboard, and really nice pool tables. Plus, the staff is always friendly and welcoming. 

But let's be real, there are definitely some downsides to this place. It's located in your typical strip mall, so nothing too exciting there. And on most nights, the smoke levels can get pretty intense. And every once in a while, you might come across some sketchy characters that make you question if you're in the right place. And if you're not a regular, good luck trying to get the busy bartenders' attention. 

Overall, it's not a bad spot to check out, especially compared to other locations of the same chain. And if you're a die-hard Packer fan, you'll probably have a blast here during game days. But for me, it's just not as impressive as it once was. "

In the competitive market of car maintenance, Tempe Acura falls short. Despite the trendy appearance of their service center, their slow service and lack of communication left much to be desired.

Upon arrival for my scheduled appointment at 10:30 am on a Saturday, I was disappointed to find that it took a whopping 3 hours for my oil change, filter replacement, inspection, and tire balance and rotation. And to top it off, they didn't even bother to keep me informed of the lengthy wait time.

After finally confronting the service advisor, who only apologized twice without offering any real solution, I returned home to realize that my tires were not rotated as originally requested. The lack of explanation for this mistake was the final straw.

While I will admit that the overall quality of the services provided by Tempe Acura were decent, the slow service and lack of communication ultimately overshadowed any positives. In the future, I will be taking my business to another establishment that can deliver the same level of quality without the added frustration. "

I've been to this location a few times now, and every time I walk in I can't help but feel disappointed. The store is small, and not in a charming way. It's more like they tried to cram everything into a tiny space and it just doesn't work. And don't even get me started on the lack of retail options. I've never seen such a small selection at a Walmart before. It's like they forgot that people come here for more than just groceries.

But speaking of groceries, I will say that the grocery side of this store is surprisingly nice. It's clean and well-maintained, and the layout is definitely different from your standard Walmart. It almost feels like a fancy grocery store, which is a pleasant surprise. But then you turn the corner and see the sad excuse for a retail section and it's just a total letdown.

I did have a positive experience with one employee, a young man who helped me with my TV purchase. He was polite, knowledgeable, and really made me feel like a valued customer. It's a shame that the rest of the store couldn't live up to his level of professionalism.

I've heard rumors about this location wanting to expand into the neighboring property, and honestly, I hope they do. As it stands now, this ""supercenter"" falls short in every way. I would almost say it's more like a glorified neighborhood market with a few extra items thrown in. So if you're in the area and need some essentials, this might do the trick. Otherwise, don't bother."
1282,"Clean hallways, clean and new furniture for guests and patients to occupy in the meeting areas.  However, rooms felt a bit cramped, with very little room between individuals.  \nI was taken back at the fact that they won't provide walkers or wheel chairs in-facility for fear the patient may injure themselves.  So, I guess they'd rather have them lay and rot in their own beds.  There is no compassion here; staff show no genuine concern, they're there for a paycheck.  The overall philosophy of this business aren't  genuinely dedicated to their patient's well-being. \n\n*Bring a clothespin for your nose because this whole facility reeks of urine and fecal material.  I can only imagine what it's like to be an immobile patient there."

We were excited to try this highly-reviewed restaurant during our trip to Vegas. After seeing all the excellent ratings, we were expecting an amazing dining experience. However, as soon as we arrived at the location, we were immediately disappointed. It turns out that this ""top-rated"" eatery is unfortunately only open to employees in the building. What a letdown! We trekked through the snow to get here, only to be turned away at the door.

Perhaps the food is truly amazing for those lucky enough to have access, but for the general public, it's a no-go. We were looking forward to indulging in some delicious dishes, but instead, we were left in the cold. It's a shame that this place is not open to everyone ‚Äì that just seems unfair. Just a heads up for anyone planning to visit ‚Äì don't bother making the trip unless you have a special invitation.

In comparison, during our visit to Vegas, we also dined at another highly-rated spot on the strip. And let me tell you, it completely blew our minds. The flavors, the presentation, the service ‚Äì everything was top-notch. But even that experience couldn't erase the disappointment of being turned away at this establishment. We won't be making the mistake of trying to visit this place again. Save yourself the trouble and opt for one of the many other amazing options on The Strip."
1284,"I never look at gas prices. I'm a creature of convenience. This was our final stop before the airport's car rental return and it was convenient in that regard.\n\nI went inside and bought some snacks while hubby put a little fuel in the Nissan rental. Large, clean, well-stocked. But the counter service included no free smile as we paid our money. I'd received sad news earlier that day and I was still able to manage a sincere smile. It unfortunately went unreturned.\n\nI think sometimes people forget that their actions really affect others. Even if you're just a voice on a phone, you never know if patience rather than irritability might make a big difference to the person on the other end of the line. Especially true when in-person. Smiles are contagious. Well, usually...  :)"
1285,"Of course your average Starbucks fare is here, as at every place across the country. \n\nWhat sets an individual location of a chain like Starbucks apart is the quality of their service and the feel of the store. Both are subpar at this particular spot. Long lines out into the terminal because the store is understaffed, and that leads to abrupt, harried staff who in turn provide an unpleasant experience for the guests. \n\nThere are also unpacked boxes of inventory lining the walls. I know that your bakery items aren't actually fresh-baked, but I like to keep a little mystery alive as to how those pastries end up in the glass case."
1286,"Nice place, the food was ok I had a sandwich which was slightly above a mediocre deli grade sandwich. Not impressed I heard good things about the food, but it's nothing to brag about. I did go in on a Sunday which was also 4th of July the service was great but the food not so much..."
1287,"I ate here for Valentines day it was sooooo busy. It was also our first time. We made reservations but it was like there was no point to make reservations because we still had to wait for 30 mins to get seated. When the waiter is there ask all the questions you need answered, Make sure you order enough sushi to get full, and ask for the check right when they give you your food because once he leaves he is going to take a lonnnnnnnnnnng time to come back, like another 20-30mins. My waiter was takashi. He was cool and nice. We ordered everything he recommended because we love surprises and trying things new so everything he recommended was delicious and the best. It was probably like that because it was a holiday like Valentines day. Just a heads up, if your planning on going here DON'T GO HERE ON A HOLIDAY!"
1288,"I used to come here with my dad all the time. However today our experience was not so pleasant. I do not appreciate your hostess rudely greeting not my father or myself but my knee to your restaurant this evening. Said hostess asked if I had a cut while I walked into your faculty and I replied with I just had surgery. She proceeded to stare at me as if I had twelve faces or was the ghost of Christmas past. We were seated and A woman rudely placed our chips and salsa down and asked if we were leaving.  Our server came and took our orders and was far from friendly. Our food came and the chimi platter I ordered was bland and my father's meal was atrocious looking. The meat was so runny, the rice was overly cooked and the beans were even mushier than the runny so called meat.  After we finished our less than perfect meals the same hostess whipped her head around the bar as if she were an owl to say her goodbyes to my leg. I quickly responded to her with the following statement \"" did you get a close enough look or would you like to take a picture?\"" She reponded with a \"" I was trying to say goodbye.\"" She also gave me one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard. I've never felt so belittled by someone who didn't even speak and it would serve your restaurant right to teach your hostess some manners and proper authentic Mexican cooking skills you claim to have. Thanks. Regards. Kathryn Mindlin. I give you a -4 star rating."

I was really excited to try this place, but unfortunately, it ended up being a huge disappointment. The whole atmosphere was just sub par. The patio seating was nice, but the inside was dirty and outdated. The staff was friendly enough, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. 

First of all, there was no valet service at this ""historic"" restaurant. We had to find our own spot in the tiny, overcrowded parking lot. And let me tell you, it was not a pleasant experience with all the trash and debris scattered around. As soon as we walked in, we were hit with a musty smell that only got worse as we made our way to the dining area. It was clear that the casino section was not maintained properly, which was evident in the unkempt escalators and grime-covered floors. 

Once we sat down, we noticed more red flags. The bathroom was gross with missing tiles and an overall run-down appearance. And even worse, the menu was literally falling apart! Can you imagine trying to enjoy a meal while worrying about your menu disintegrating in your hands? We decided not to take any chances and didn't even bother ordering food. For the same price, we could have gone to a much nicer restaurant on the strip. Trust me, skip this place and save yourself the disappointment."
1290,Rice is rock hard.   Jaded chicken taste like its been sitting there for days.  Brought it to the young girls attention and they had to say was oh.  Plenty of people eating here but maybe they didn't get the rice?\nI think I may have just come to\nLate and there menu is to big for them to make it fresh when they order it.   Oh well. Plus they give you free chips and salsa for a good review on this.  Reason for all the stars on here? You decided but don't say I didn't warn you.    Maybe there chips are good and worth the stars.  Guess I'll never know
1291,"Stayed at the Golden Nugget for a friend's b-day celebration and we wanted a really low key night, so Gold Diggers was suggested because, one: it's in the hotel we were staying in, and two: it's cheap and not pretentious. \n\nI like the look of the place, modern, fairly small, but everything is new and shiny. There is a patio overlooking Fremont St, a bar, and a dance floor. Lots of places to sit, which is good. (as we all know, a lot of places make you pay VIP to sit, but not Gold Diggers. Yay!) \n\nThere was such a mix of people there, it's hard to describe. Middle aged business men getting their groove on while away from the wifey, Young girls in groups just wanting to dance and not be bothered by dudes, Couples in love slow dancing to fast songs...The clientele is a lot more...diverse that it is on the strip, with all kinds of people, which kind of made it interesting...not all the cookie cutter types. (but if you are looking for glamour puss girls or metro guys, this is probably not your scene. No bouncer at the front picking and choosing who he wants to let in, which is awesome.) \n\nThe DJ spun a mix of 70's, 80's, 90's and Top 40. He changed the songs a little too soon for my taste, (Only got about 30 seconds of a song) but I guess everyone has ADD so that's how it has to be., lol...\n\nI would come here again if I wanted to dance and not worry about getting all swankified for the Strip. Very chill place to mingle and get your groove on."

While I do enjoy the food at this Greek restaurant, I can't say that I will be returning anytime soon. The service is consistently slow and on my recent visit, it took over an hour for our food to arrive. Not to mention, the wait time for a table was also quite long. I understand that the kitchen may have been backed up, but even a simple acknowledgment or apology would have sufficed. Instead, we were left waiting without any updates or explanations. On top of that, when I asked about the status of our food, an employee came over with the original wait list to prove that we had not been waiting for as long as we thought. It was a frustrating experience to say the least. However, I will admit that the food is indeed delicious. Their Greek Fries, which are just feta, add a nice touch to the meal and the free soups in the eating area are a nice bonus. But unfortunately, the slow service and lack of communication really put a damper on the overall dining experience. I may give this place another chance, but for now, I'll be exploring other Greek restaurants in the area."

The food at this place was fantastic, I cannot deny that. My taste buds were dancing with every bite, especially with their delicious chips and salsa on the side. The service was also top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff making sure we were well taken care of. But unfortunately, I will not be going back. And let me tell you why. The state of cleanliness in this place is unacceptable. As soon as I walked in, I noticed the walls were covered in stains and grime, making me question the overall hygiene of the restaurant. If the front of the house is that dirty, one can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. It truly took away from my dining experience, and I left feeling disappointed. It's a shame because the food and service were really great, but the cleanliness aspect just cannot be ignored. I hope they can work on improving their overall sanitation, or else I will have to find my delicious food elsewhere."
1294,"Will only visit this place if I'm comped.  What my party had to pay was more than $150 for 5 people.  The food was terrible and bland.  We had to wait over an hour to pay $150 for a meh experience.\n\nGo to the buffet at the Palms, 1/3 the price of this place and it is so much better!"

I recently visited this restaurant with my family after purchasing a Groupon deal, thinking we were in for a great deal. However, our experience was a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the price for the Groupon was unbeatable. On the other hand, our waiter seemed less than thrilled when we mentioned the deal and quickly snatched away the regular menu. We shrugged it off, assuming that Groupons must have some limitations. But unfortunately, the service didn't improve from there. Throughout the night, we had to flag down multiple people just for a refill of water. It almost seemed like we were being ignored because of the Groupon. And then there was the food... I hate to say it, but it just didn't taste fresh. It almost had a frozen and fishy taste to it. Overall, it was a disappointing experience and we won't be returning. We'll take our money elsewhere.

The Sugar Factory is a lively and vibrant candy store and restaurant nestled in the hustle and bustle of the city. Known for its playful and whimsical atmosphere, the restaurant boasts an extensive menu of American cuisine for all-day dining. And let's not forget about their famous selection of decadent desserts, including their signature candy-infused cocktails that are a hit with customers.

I was fortunate enough to snag a table by the window, which overlooks the stunning streetscape of the city. From there, I could watch the mesmerizing water show at The Bellagio Hotel every fifteen minutes. It was a treat for both me and my daughter, who was completely entertained by the sight.

I decided to order the cobb salad, a classic dish filled with romaine lettuce, roasted chicken, tomatoes, bacon, and egg, topped with a tangy blue cheese dressing. While the salad was decent in size, the flavor didn't quite justify the steep price tag of $16.95.

Being an adventurous spirit, I opted for the sour apple blow pop martini, made with Three Olives Bubble Gum Vodka and Apple Pucker Liquer, garnished with Pop Rocks and a blow pop. It all sounded too fun and exciting on paper, but the reality was much too sweet (and sour) for my liking. In hindsight, I should have just stuck with my trusty dirty martini, which would have been much more enjoyable. But I couldn't resist trying one of their signature candy cocktails. However, at $16.00 a pop, it was a pricey experiment.

With a group of four, our bill added up pretty quickly, thanks to the indulgent meals and array of drinks.

Overall, The Sugar Factory is a must-visit for anyone looking for a fun and unique dining experience. The service is top-notch, and the atmosphere is lively and inviting. I can see why it's a popular spot among locals and tourists alike. However, the high prices for average food and drinks may not be worth the splurge on a regular basis. But for a special occasion or a one-time visit, I definitely recommend checking out The Sugar Factory."
1297,To the barista that made my drink I saw you drop my cup and didn't give me a new one. Luckily I don't drink off of my rim that I wont complain and mess up your long line of drinks. Which btw wouldn't be so long if all your partners were actually working!!!
1298,"Received an amazon local deal to this salon for my birthday.  Tried calling to set up an appointment and never received a call back.  Tried emailing (per the suggestion on their voicemail) and never received a response.  Finally showed up to their address and according to the Studio Salons listing they don't even have a spot there.  For those unfamiliar with Studio Salons, it's a large faculty that's subdivided into small independently owned salons that are like rooms within the large facility.  Each space can fit maybe 2-3 people at a time.  Anyway this one isn't listed there.  \n\nI plan to call Amazon to get the money back for the voucher but I see they are still advertising deals so I wanted to be sure to warn others not to purchase for this place.  From what I can tell it doesn't exist and assuming it does they don't ever return calls so it's impossible to make an appointment.  I also prefer to go to a larger salon where they have the space to cater to more than one person at a time.  The Studio Salon setup presents an awkward feel in my opinion."

Just visited the charming ""alte schmiede"" restaurant and had a rather unpleasant experience. While the rustic atmosphere and friendly service were certainly appealing, the condescending attitude of the older woman with glasses left a bad taste in my mouth as soon as I walked in. Despite being a loyal customer for years, I was met with rudeness and lack of professionalism.

Save yourself the frustration and steer clear of this location. Don't waste your time dealing with the snobby ""alte schmiede"" hag, head over to the nearby West Charleston store where the staff is welcoming and truly awesome. I made the switch and left feeling much happier and less annoyed."

Having lunch on the patio at this restaurant was a bit of a letdown. The lack of charm was noticeable, with no view or decor to speak of. Not even a potted plant to add some life to the space. However, my mom's Artisan Tuna Melt was enjoyable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Quinoa Salad she ordered, which never arrived despite our server and food runner promising to check on it. My sister and I both ordered the Nicoise salad, but were disappointed to find that it was missing half of the ingredients that were listed on the menu. Thankfully, they did comp one of the salads to make up for the mistake, but it was still a sub-par dining experience. With so many great dining options in the area, we will be exploring those instead of returning here."

We had high hopes for AJK Chinese Cuisine after hearing great things from friends, but unfortunately, it just didn't live up to our expectations. Maybe it was just an off night, but our experience here was less than stellar. The service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean, but the food fell short. The angel blossoms (aka crab rangoon) were a hit, but the rest of our entr√©es were underwhelming. The hot and sour soup had a good kick, but the rest of the dishes lacked flavor. The fried rice was a saving grace, as it was not greasy like most places, but it was the only dish that stood out. In fact, we ended up taking most of our family dinner home because we just didn't enjoy it enough to finish it. After our visit, we can't help but feel like we could have gotten the same or even better quality of food at a chain restaurant like Panda Express. Perhaps we just caught them on a bad night, but for now, we will stick to our other favorite Chinese spots."

I recently stayed at Paris Las Vegas for three nights and spent most of my time at their casino. As someone who loves playing on tables, I dedicated more than 25 hours to gambling and unfortunately ended up losing $2500 USD. My rewards for this dedication? A mere $10. I was extremely disappointed with the reward points system at this casino. In comparison to other hotel and casino establishments, Paris Las Vegas falls short in terms of value. Other places would not only comp your stay, but also provide meals and other perks. But here, I received a slice of pizza. It's clear that other hotels in Vegas offer a much better experience, so do your research and choose wisely. As for me, I will not be returning to any of the Caesars properties after this disappointing experience."

Mike is a great guy and an even better Attorney! He truly cared about my case and me and kept me up to date on everything that was going on. However, my recent experience with the customer service staff at the office left a lot to be desired. When I called to ask about the status of my case and the next steps, the person I spoke to was in the middle of a conversation with another employee and didn't seem to be fully engaged in our conversation. Not only was it rude, but it also made me question their professionalism. In a situation where my future is at stake, I expected more focus and attention from the staff. It's hard to trust that my case is being handled with the utmost care when the staff seems more interested in chatting with each other than assisting clients. Though I appreciate Mike's hard work and dedication, I can't help but feel frustrated by the lack of customer service at the office.

I've been to this coffee shop a few times and I have to say, I am thoroughly unimpressed. The first time I came in, it was for a study session and I figured I would grab a drink and a cookie to refuel. The mocha they suggested was weak and watery, not at all what I look for in a coffee. And the cookie was just average, nothing special. I also noticed that the baristas didn't seem to have much knowledge or confidence when it came to the food or coffee. Every time I asked for a suggestion, they didn't have anything creative and just pointed me to their most popular item. But clearly, that doesn't mean it's actually good. I left feeling disappointed and dissatisfied.

However, I decided to give this place another chance because I had heard great things about their gelato. And I have to admit, it was the only redeeming factor of this place. I tried their birthday cake flavor and it was delicious. They have a good variety of flavors and even let you sample before you choose. It's definitely better than the gelato place down the street, but it's a shame that the coffee and food don't live up to the same standard. Overall, I wouldn't bother coming back here unless it's just for the gelato. Stay away from their coffee and food, trust me."

We decided to give the Culinary Dropout a try after hearing great things about their unique atmosphere and delicious food. As soon as we walked in, we could see why the place was called ""dropout"" - the interior design was definitely an acquired taste. The oversized seats may have been comfortable for lounging, but not for eating a meal. Our server was nice and recommended the pretzel fondue, which was the highlight of our meal. However, my bistro steak left much to be desired. It was just okay and the fries were the only saving grace. I couldn't say the same for the blue cheese sauce, which was a disappointment. My girlfriend, on the other hand, raved about her sandwich. While the food wasn't terrible, it certainly didn't live up to the hype.

I have to say, I was really excited to try this place after hearing such great things about it. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the staff was incredibly friendly. Our server was on top of everything, making sure we had everything we needed and our drinks were always refilled promptly. We were pleasantly surprised when our food came out quickly, but that's where the positives end. While the quantity and quality of the food was good, my dish was just okay. The bbq ribs, however, were absolutely delicious and definitely the standout item on the menu. Unfortunately, the other dishes we ordered, including my husband's steak, were quite bland and underwhelming. It's a shame because we had high hopes for this place, but I can't help but feel that we could have gotten similar food from other restaurants in the area. As much as I enjoyed the ribs, I don't think it's worth making the long drive out here again. "
1317,"This event has all the right ideas but doesn't quite logistically make sense to me.  \n\nThis was my first time attending after living in Charlotte my whole life.  I didn't have any expectations but the idea of getting to sample a ton of restaurants in the area sounded good to me!\n\nThe heat...didn't bother me....the people...didn't bother me...the quality of food...eh, didn't really bother me.\nBut, what DID bother me was the layout and the quality of vendors.  If you are claiming this is a TASTE of Charlotte then show me something worth tasting.  Hooters?  Salsaritas?  Costco?  Tons of bars and grills?  Come on.  I know there were a couple of good quality restaurants represented but to that point I agree with others that say the crowds are just out of control.  If you have to wait in a 2 hour line to get one of the 3 decent restaurants represented that it holds up the entire walkway..something is logistically wrong.  Maybe this should be held indoors at the convention center?  Maybe on a wider street?  I don't know but something wasn't working and you don't have to be an event planner to know that.\n\nThere was an element of class missing from the overall event in my opinion.  I felt like people would rather throw an elbow to get to the chicken wings than enjoy a stroll through yummy food lane.  \n\nOverall...I thought it was brutal.  Would I go back?  Probably not unless I saw that they stepped up the vendor list and that the layout was totally different.\n\n\n***on a positive note, I discovered Spice (in Concord) and they were great.  I love Indian food and am always looking for a new spot so I will give them a try in the near future"
1318,"

My friends and I were excited to try this Indian restaurant, as it had been highly recommended to us. However, our experience was far from enjoyable. The atmosphere was lackluster and the service was subpar. Our waitress seemed disinterested and barely acknowledged us throughout the meal. When we asked about certain dishes, she had no knowledge of them and simply shrugged her shoulders. It was clear that she did not care about her job or the customers.

Despite the poor service, we were willing to overlook it if the food was good. Unfortunately, it was just average. The dishes lacked flavor and were not as authentic as we had hoped. We were disappointed with the overall quality of the food.

To make matters worse, on our way out of the restaurant, we were met with judging glares from the staff at the front. It made us feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. We were dressed nicely and always tip well, but it seemed like that didn't matter to them. It was a very awkward and unpleasant experience.

In the future, if I am craving Indian food, I will go to a different restaurant where I feel welcome and valued as a customer. I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for good food and friendly service. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that are worth trying instead. Save yourself the disappointment and check out the N9NE Steakhouse at Palms, Mortons off Flamingo Road or Gordon Ramsays in Paris Hotel/Casino for a better dining experience."
1319,"First things first - Mexican food is something that I can love one day, and hate the next, so for my review I put on my unbiased hat and entered Mariachi's.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is how glad I was that I had booked ahead, as the moderatly sized restaurant was jam packed with customers and full of people looking hungry as they waited for a free table. So tip one - book!\n\nThat aside, the traditional mexican music that is barely audable above the hubbub of diners and the neutral decor lends a relaxed atmosphere and the margaritas we had while waiting in the bar area was second to none.\n\nThe menu is jam packed with traditional mexican and tex-mex foods, but we had to wait a little while for our orders, and the food was basic and according to my dining partner, the fajitas were bland.\n\nThat said, Mariachi's is smack bang in the middle of the city, and is always going to be busy with its trade from tourists - so the atmosphere is great, even if the food is a little uninspiring."

I truly wanted to love Rumor. After hearing great things about their food, I was excited to try it for myself. Unfortunately, my experience did not live up to the hype. While the food itself was delicious, the service left much to be desired. I had to remind our waitress multiple times about my sandwich, which arrived almost an hour after ordering. Thankfully, we weren't in a rush, but it did dampen our experience.

The drinks at the pool were also a letdown. Despite being in a smaller, more low-key location, the prices were comparable to those on The Strip. And to make matters worse, they were served in tiny plastic cups - the kind you get for water in hotel rooms. It was definitely not worth the price.

To add insult to injury, the pool area was not very well maintained. The sand that filled the area was annoying and got way too hot, sticking to our feet and making it uncomfortable to walk around. I couldn't help but wonder whose brilliant idea it was to have sand in a pool area.

But what really soured the experience for me was the encounter I had with a supposed manager. As soon as we entered the pool area, he warned me about the ""state law"" against outside food and drinks. I couldn't help but be skeptical about this so-called law, and the fact that the clean towel bin was empty just added to the overall disappointment.

All in all, while the food was good, the service and overall experience at Rumor left much to be desired. I certainly won't be recommending it to any friends or family, and I won't be returning for any pool parties after such a embarrassing afternoon. "

We were in a tough situation, stranded in Phoenix on our way to Dallas for Christmas. After being stuck on hold for hours, I decided to try my luck with booking a room at a Marriott hotel. Thankfully, I was connected to Phil, who went above and beyond to help us out. Not only did he give us a great rate, but he even arranged for the shuttle to pick us up right away. 

When we arrived at the hotel, we were exhausted and just wanted a comfortable place to rest for the few hours we had before our next flight. The rooms were clean and cozy, with all the amenities we needed. And to top it off, Phil was kind enough to upgrade us to a better room. Truly exceptional customer service. 

I am always impressed by the level of hospitality at Marriott hotels, and this experience was no different. Despite the short stay, we were well taken care of and left feeling refreshed and ready for our next flight. Thank you, Phil and Marriott, for saving our Christmas travel plans. However, I must say, the prices at this location were a bit steep compared to other hotels in the area. Next time, I may consider booking online for a better deal."
1322,Ate here for the first time last night. My husband and I were meeting some friends for dinner before a concert and we picked this place to meet at. \nIn my opinion I think the prices are kind of high for what you get. \nMy husband and I are on a bit of a budget right now so we choose to split a taco plate.\nThe tacos were decent and the sopapillas that come with the meal were good. \nThe restaurant is very nice and our server was extremely nice and helpful. \nI probably wouldn't go back as I can get cheaper and better Mexican food elsewhere and also I don't live in the Glendale area.\n \nThe place is definitely good for large groups.\n\nOur server and free sopapillas was the best part of the experience.

I finally got a chance to try out Gallaghers, and I have to say, it definitely lived up to the hype. I was a little hesitant because of the out-of-state visitors constantly wanting to come here, but I have to admit, it was a pleasant surprise.

The first thing that caught my attention was the display of aged steaks in the window. I couldn't resist and immediately suggested this place to my friends and family. Despite being busy, the hostesses were able to seat us right away and we were even given a great spot near the bathroom (which was a huge bonus for my mom).

The atmosphere was bustling with a mix of families, business professionals, and couples on a romantic night out. The service was friendly and prompt, despite how busy they were. We started off by sharing a variety of appetizers, and I have to say, the bruschetta and calamari were my favorites.

Moving on to our entrees, we all ordered different dishes and shared them. The menu had a good mix of options, and we ended up trying their salads, crabcakes, and of course, the steaks. I opted for the filet mignon, cooked medium rare, and it was perfectly tender and flavorful.

Now, I have to mention that the prices for the steaks did make me pause for a second. But trust me, the taste definitely made up for it. And if you're in the mood for seafood, just be aware that the prices vary on a daily basis.

To round out our meal, I couldn't resist ordering the four cheese mac as a side, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Creamy, cheesy, and absolutely delicious. And the best part? There's no formal dress code here, so we were able to relax and enjoy our meal in whatever we happened to be wearing.

Overall, I had a great experience at Gallaghers. The only reason I'm not giving it a higher rating is because the prices were a bit steep for my liking. But if you're looking for a nice dinner spot with great food and a lively atmosphere, this is definitely the place to be."

Overall, I was left unimpressed with my experience at this B&B. Despite its prime location in the bustling Gay Village, the atmosphere was strangely quiet and lacking in energy. Although the room was clean and newly renovated, it failed to make up for the lack of amenities and limited breakfast options. I was hopeful when I arrived, but unfortunately, the lackluster food and lack of options left me feeling disappointed and underwhelmed. The staff was friendly enough, but their indifference towards my dissatisfaction only added to my disappointment. I had high expectations for this place, but alas, it fell short."
1325,"My first experience at Monta wasn't very good despite all the gleaming reviews I've read. The tonkatsu ramen tasted slightly gamy and was way too salty. I gave them another shot and it was a lot better. Gone was the gamy flavor of the broth. It was good but not amazing, in my opinion. Not the kind of broth you want to drink up. The chashu pork had a slightly smoky flavor and was OK. The nice wait staff and the cheap ramen help me see the attraction to this place. However, compared to other ramen places, I don't believe Monta's ramen stands out in presentation and flavor."

I was quite disappointed with my recent experience at this website company. I used to be a loyal customer and loved their products, especially their Vitacost branded Raw honey. But my last order of honey was a total letdown. It was a completely different kind and when I contacted the company, they admitted it was a mistake. So I asked for a refund. But it took them a week to finally give me a refund, and even then it was only as a ""one-time courtesy"". To make matters worse, I wrote a negative review about the honey, explaining the difference from their previous one, and it was promptly removed. In their latest email to me, I was even labeled as a ""Detractor"". As someone who used to love this company, I am extremely disappointed in their customer service and their handling of negative reviews. Although their past products were great, I will definitely be looking for alternatives in the future."
1327,"You're not going to get sick here, but it isn't very good. \n\nFast, expensive, and close to gambling, who needs anything else? We were stuck needing food about 10 pm at Circus Circus and this was open. Overpriced by alot, the salsa was good, everything else was boring or flavorless. But it was food and we didn't have to drive somewhere else."
1328,"I struggle with this review.  I have been to B21 a couple times for the turkey club - almost always a delicious burger unless the cook burns the crap out of one side and still serves it!  (That only happened one time though).  So I will say the food deserves 3 stars.  However, everytime I order this artisan burger the bun is a veritable hockey puck.  Inedible!!!   So, in the spirit of eating healthier I just toss the bun aside and eat the turkey patty (yum!)! \n\nThe 2 stars are for the cleanliness of the place.  It's slow most times that I go and the bar with the drinks and sauces is disgusting.  Additionally, the floors are just as gross.  \n\nI agree with everyone - overpriced food."
1329,"We tried this burger place for the first time a few years ago after receiving a dinner voucher following a timeshare presentation. We remember the food being really good and have returned each time we were in town. The burgers were always cooked perfectly. My favorite had always been the mahi mahi burger, although the coleslaw has become dry and bland over the years. The service is always friendly although the efficicency is a hit and miss. The last couple times we have found the food quality and portions to have gone down. It is difficult to sell a $10 and up burger without fries and drink to the average person on vacation, especially if the portions and quality are  undeserving. I am sure their business will continue due to being in a good location and having tourists as the main clientele. Good thing they are not starving for return customers. We sadly no longer have this place on our \""must visit\"" list each trip."
1330,"Another great downtown coffee shop. They have a nice outdoor patio and a cozy section in the back with couches and armchairs. They also have local musicians play some nights which can be quite enjoyable. The coffee and atmosphere are pretty good. Seating can be a little sparse and when it's crowded, it can be a bit hard to move around.\n\nI don't have any complaints really, but Aroma doesn't quite have the draw for me that other downtown coffee shops have."

I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, my experience just kept getting worse and worse. My husband and I ordered the Deokk Bokki and were excited to try it. We patiently waited for our hot pot to cook for about 15 minutes and it smelled amazing. I was just about to take my first bite when my wife suddenly gasped in shock.

She had found a small piece of glass in her mouth after taking a sip of the soup. We immediately called over the staff, who were apologetic and offered to not charge us for the meal. However, how could we continue eating, knowing that there could be more bits of glass in our food?

The staff tried to make things right, but the damage had already been done. The taste of the soup, although initially pleasant, was now overshadowed by the fear of finding more glass in our meal. We were so disappointed and honestly, a little shaken up by the experience.

I can't comment on the rest of the food since we didn't get to try it, but the thought of possibly consuming more glass was enough to put us off from ever returning to this place. It's such a shame because the soup smelled great and we were excited to try the rest of the menu.

Needless to say, this was a shocking and unpleasant experience. We expected better from this restaurant, but unfortunately, it fell short in terms of food safety and overall satisfaction. We will not be returning and would not recommend this place to anyone."
1332,"Love love the product. But the horrible experience with the staff one afternoon ruined it for me. My friend and I had stopped in for drinks the wait was long which is understandable, but the immaturity of the staff went beyond normal high school kids working a part time job. After waiting for our drinks while watching the boy, who was supposed to be making one of them goof off ..walking around..in the back room.. Around the register..we finally got one drink, we ask for the 2nd and were told we didn't have another I had to show my receipt, then told they were out of an ingredient for the drink. Even though they were making the very same drink for another customer. I got my money back from a now apologetic employee. The boy behind the counter then started to argue and act belligerent towards my friend and dropped the F bomb. She called the DM, who a couple weeks later sent her a gift card. I'm not one to write reviews if something bad happens I move on but the one and only time my friend returned there the boy that swore at her was still working there . I will say that I have saved money over the last few months since that happened by buying my own juicer."
1333,"
There's no denying that the food here is top-notch. Every dish we ordered was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. It's just a shame that the service didn't quite live up to the same standard. Our server was friendly enough, but it seemed like they were juggling too many tables at once. We definitely had to flag them down multiple times for refills and we couldn't help but notice that other tables who arrived after us were already enjoying their meals while we waited. It was a bit disappointing, but I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to just a particularly busy night for our server. Overall, I still recommend this place for the food alone. Just maybe don't come with a big group if you want top-notch service."

After hearing rave reviews about this spot, I had high hopes for my solo dining experience at this sushi joint. And while the food did not disappoint, sadly the overall dining experience fell short. Let's start with the good - the sushi was absolutely fantastic. Each piece was delicate and flavorful, and the miso soup was incredibly comforting. But my excitement was dampened when I was shown to my table - a cramped spot in a busy service area with no view to speak of. As a single diner, I couldn't help but feel a little slighted, even though I had made a reservation. And while the servers were friendly, getting their attention was like pulling teeth. Multiple attempts to ask for a napkin or inquire about the chef's recommended dish were met with silence. To top it off, I was given a plate of average sushi instead of the exciting special I had been hoping for. But hey, it still tasted great. The one true highlight of the evening was the bottle of Wataribune Junmai Daiginjo Sake, which was a splurge but worth it. Overall, while I enjoyed my meal, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down by the lackluster service and seating arrangement. Perhaps with a better table and a little more attentiveness, this could have been a five star experience. "
1335,"I wavered between two and three stars.  I think truthfully this is a 2.5 star place.   Nothing totally objectionable or inedible, but just not my bag.  I've been to Brixx up in Birkdale and I remember liking my salad.  I was brand new to the area and my Realtor took me there one day after looking at apartments.  Maybe I was too focused on apartment hunting to remember it clearly, but I remember liking my salad from Birkdale.\n\nI've eaten at the uptown place twice.  Both on Saturday nights while partaking in the free trivia they offer.  Four stars for trivia, but I digress.  The first time I had a salad and bread sticks.  The bread sticks were weird.  Not a fan and I love anything vaguely resembling dough!  The salad was unremarkable.  Not good, not bad, just kinda average.  I've had better salads at Panera.  Anywho, I tried a pizza the 2nd time.  Again it was just meh, I've had some frozen pizzas that were better.  But in the same vein I've had way worse experiences.    \n\nWill I return to Brixx in uptown....sure, I love me some trivia.  But I may just drink (responsibly of course!)....don't know that I'll try the food b/c it just doesn't blow me away and both times I came away sightly disappointed.\n\nShout out to my server from the last time - wish I could remember her name.  Well, Brixx validates parking and somehow I lost my ticket. I went back to the garage and attempted to pull a ticket on foot, but damn garage ticket dispensers are smart.  They won't dispense a ticket w/o sensing a car is present.  Anyway I asked my server what Brixx could do b/c I was genuinely afraid of how I'd get my car out past the gates. My server gave me her ticket, validated and everything.  That was beyond.  Maybe she was conning me to get a bigger tip, but I don't care...I made sure she was taken care of.  I think my bill was $13 or so for my pizza, but I tipped her an extra $5.  She was the bomb.\n\nETA - Ok I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 b/c my server was awesome.  She went above and beyond.  It appears as if management reads these reviews so I really wish I remembered her name b/c she deserves kudos.  Maybe they'll figure it out/remember me (it was the night of the big Bruce Springsteen concert across the street at Time Warner).  If not, well all I can say is the service is always great and for that I'll fondly remember Brixx in uptown."

I was really looking forward to trying out True Foods since I had heard such great things about it. The concept of using only fresh, local and seasonal ingredients really appealed to me. Unfortunately, my experience did not live up to the hype. I tried the Kale Tuscan Salad and was disappointed by how small and underwhelming it was. And to make matters worse, the Cucumber Honey Lemonade that I was so excited to try was nothing special. In fact, it was quite bland and lacked the promised burst of flavor. The staff, while friendly, seemed uninterested and didn't offer any suggestions when I expressed my disappointment with my meal. Overall, I left feeling let down and won't be returning anytime soon. It's a shame that True Foods didn't live up to its name for me."
1337," The atmosphere was also lacking as it was very noisy and there was constant arguing between staff members.

To be honest, I used to come to this place all the time. It was one of my go-to spots for a casual dinner with friends. However, my recent experience was extremely disappointing and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

First of all, let's talk about the service. It was slow and I felt completely ignored by the staff. We waited forever for our food and drinks, which were mediocre at best. And when we asked for more, it was like we were inconveniencing them. I even had to track down the manager, who never bothered to come to our table despite our complaints. It was clear that the staff was not properly trained and lacked any sense of hospitality.

What's worse is that the atmosphere was just not enjoyable. The constant loud arguing between staff members made it hard to even hold a conversation. And to top it off, the sushi rolls were served to us one at a time, causing us to get full quickly and feel like we were just wasting our money on the all-you-can-eat option. It's a shame because the food used to be good here, but even that has gone downhill.

Overall, it's clear that this place has major management and staff issues. It's honestly just sad to see a once decent spot turn into such a disappointment. I would not recommend this place to anyone, no matter how good the food may be. The horrible customer service and chaotic atmosphere simply ruin the dining experience. Save your money and go elsewhere. Hopefully they'll get their act together and improve, but until then, I'll be taking my business elsewhere."

Pros: 

- We were excited to see the restaurant still in business after 13 years.
- The lemon meringue pie was quite tasty.
- The wife enjoyed her chicken entree.

Cons:

- The interior was dated and the overall atmosphere was shabby.

Manager is well meaning but often unavailable and not given the tools to do his job. Pool is a wreck for weeks at a time and all common areas are filthy, rarely cleaned or maintained.

""The Cajun yardog definitely has some unique food options on their menu, from their traditional Cajun dishes to their famous yardogs. However, my recent experience at this restaurant left me feeling underwhelmed. Despite there being open tables, the hostess refused to seat my group of four until the other couple arrived. It was like we were being accused of lying. After trying to reason with the hostess, we ended up just saying we were two people to get a table. To top it off, the owner didn't seem to care about our frustration and didn't offer any solutions. Not only was the wait ridiculous, but their policy was just as absurd. This whole experience made us leave and head to a different restaurant. Needless to say, we won't be returning to the Cajun yardog anytime soon."""

The highlight of our evening at this establishment was definitely the exceptional customer service from the manager, Aaron. He went above and beyond to make sure our 10-year anniversary dinner was unforgettable. Despite a small hiccup with our original server, Aaron quickly took charge and made sure we were well taken care of. His generous gesture of two glasses of champagne was just the start of a wonderful evening at this restaurant.

And let's not forget about the food - it was simply amazing. Each dish was carefully crafted by the chef, whose passion for his work could be tasted in every bite. Our plates were bursting with flavorful and perfectly cooked dishes. And the ambiance of the restaurant only added to the overall experience.

I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a romantic evening or a special occasion. The staff truly cares about their guests and the quality of food is top-notch. I have no doubt that we will be back for many more special occasions to come. Thank you to the entire team at this establishment for making our 10-year anniversary dinner one to remember! "
1343,"I can only comment on what I experienced during our night time visit for \""the Gauntlet\"" haunted house. We had purchased a combo ticket for the haunted house and spooky golf. We have only recently moved here and didn't know our way around and the signs weren't clear of where to go. Having visited the restroom first, I found it to be disgusting with an overflowed toilet and water on the floor. Quickly leaving that area we had to ask around to find the haunted house. It was well done for the space used and I have no compliant about that. Once done with the haunted house we went to get our golf clubs and proceeded to what we thought was the golf course. We didn't know where to go so picked one of two- called the Princess. Really tough course and I wondered where all of the decorations were. Once done the crazy course we came across the one we expected to play on- the spooky one but had no signs leading to it. I complained about it and was told \""we don't tell people about the spooky one unless they ask and if we wanted to play we can pay extra\"".\nNo apologies and really- no signs?? \nHad to visit the restroom again before leaving and found it to be functioning but disgusting still. Note to parents- bring hand sanitizer and eat elsewhere as the food looked awful as well."
1344,This place is not good at all. The only thing that is good is the chips and salsa (which they charge for).

Something just didn't taste right....I tried some Tabasco; nope. Then some ketchup; sorta helped. I washed everything down with my Vegas priced Corona Light ($6), which sorta ameliorated the situation b/c it gave me a slight buzz...haha. \n\nAnyway, there aren't a lot of quick-bite options on Studio Walk, but for $10, I could have gotten a couple of happy meals at McDonald's across the way."

In the end, it made for comic relief, because you really don't get to see this type of thing anywhere. \n\nWe got some sort of newish Ford that had 58K miles on it. This babe-magnet has seen a day or two in the Vegas heat. It was a ropey little thing. My man said it was like Barney Rubble was underneath the hood. So funny! \n\nThe main pain in the arse though, was returning the car. O! M! to the G! Why was it so disorganized? It took like 45 minutes to check out. No distinguishable lines. Who's renting a car? Who's returning a car? Total chaos. To the point you're looking at people who work there who aren't helping customers and saying to yourself \""wtf? can you help me?\"" It was like being at what I assume a welfare office would be like.  It was unreal. \n\nThe \""airport shuttle\"" was another bag of fun. Finally we get on the shuttle, and the driver randomly drops off two korean ladies in sun hats off at CVS. What? It was like a bad movie! Without missing a beat, we are back rolling again.  We pull up to what looks like some sort of station, to be told to get off, go across the street, find someone with a green vest, who will then tell us which shuttle to get onto for the airport. Are you joking? I couldn't stop laughing. \n\nIt's cheap because you pay for it in stress. Which eventually turns into laughing, it's so unorganized and crazy."

Being a vegan, I was excited to try out Fern for my veganniversary celebration. The restaurant had such a cozy and intimate atmosphere with charming farmhouse and spa d√©cor. Our hostess, Monica or Monique (can't remember her name exactly), was amazingly cool and friendly. We had reservations through One Table and arrived at 7 PM for dinner. The place filled up quickly after that, so I was glad we already had a table.

Let's get to the food. The onion rings with vegan remoulade were the star of the show. They were crispy, perfectly seasoned, and paired perfectly with the tangy remoulade. We loved it so much that when our next course came out, the chef almost lost a few fingers trying to take away the dish with the remoulade.

Next up, the Sweet Potato Reuben with red cabbage sauerkraut and kale chips. While the sandwich was good, it was a bit too salty for my taste. I thought it was the sauerkraut, but even the sweet potatoes seemed to contribute to the saltiness. However, the kale chips were absolutely amazing.

My husband ordered the 200-year-old flatbread with vegan sausage and fingerling potatoes, and let me tell you, it was delicious. The flatbread was large enough to share and had the perfect texture and flavor. The fingerling potatoes had a beautiful sear on the outside and were a perfect accompaniment.

But the real hero of the night was the dessert ‚Äì the Vegan Peach Beignets. Oh my, they were heavenly. One bite, and I was transported to a mystical land with unicorns and glitter. We tried to save some for the next day, but I couldn't resist and ate them all before my husband left for work. I had to make the long drive back to get another order ‚Äì that's how good they were.

Fern is definitely a must-visit for some amazing vegetarian/vegan food. Even if you're not a vegetarian, you'll thoroughly enjoy the food here. Don't miss out on their delicious offerings, including the unbelievable beignets ‚Äì they may just save your marriage too, just kidding (or am I?)."
1348,"Good basic car wash location\nTERRIBLE DETAILING SERVICE\n\nDanny's provides a good basic car wash service. Exterior wash and interior vacuum and wipe for $12.99. Unfortunately their detailing services are terrible and a complete  ripoff. For $150.00 you get the same thing you get for a $12.99 wash. Danny's service personnel will discount the detailing service to $130 after you say NO the first time. Once you commit expect to get a phone call from the detailer trying to convince you that you need to spend an additional $80 for clay grit removal and polishing. After 2 hours your car will look the same as it did after you take it through the $12.99 basic wash. The big pieces will be clean but all the corners will be dirty. They will vacuum the big spots and your mats but the corners and areas under and around your seats will be left untouched. The exterior will be washed but all the corners, edges and all the areas you expect to be 'detailed' will be dirty. Your wheels will be clean on the large surface areas but all the edges and corners of the wheels will be dirty. \n\nSpend the $12.99 for a decent car wash bout don't get ripped-off spending an extra $100 for what they call detailing."
1349,"Yes, I went all the way to Las Vegas to have pho when there's a shop on pretty much every corner in my neighborhood.  About half the group wanted to try the pho and the other half wanted food from the coffee shop.  We were told that if we put our order in at the coffee shop we could order from both menus.  \n\nI ordered pho ga.  I noticed they had a Vietnamese sandwich on the menu too.  I was pretty hungry, so I went in on that with a friend.  The pho, as I expected was ok, nice broth, tender pieces of chicken etc.  The sandwich was the stand out of the meal.  The bread was crusty, the pork was smokey and flavorful.  I would definitely get that again. \n\nI will note that ordering from both menus slowed down the arrival of our food to the table.  I heard something about coordinating both kitchens.  So I wouldn't try this if you're in a hurry."

I used to love coming to this place for their delicious food and relaxing atmosphere. However, my recent visit left me disappointed. The lack of ventilation and low lighting made it difficult to enjoy the meal and read the menu. And let's not forget the strong smell of spices that lingered on me long after I left. Not exactly the kind of perfume I was looking for. \n\nNow onto the food. The veggie samosas were a letdown with their thick and heavy skin. And the sambar vada was dense and lacked flavor. The only saving grace was the sambar, without which the donut would have been unbearable to eat. \n\nMy mom ordered the tandoori chicken dinner, but it failed to meet our expectations. The chicken was not as smoky and lacked the signature tandoori seasoning that we were used to. The dark meat was also underdone, which was a major disappointment. The sides were nothing to write home about either. The mixed veggies had a strange ginseng-like taste and the soup was bland. And to top it off, the dessert never even made it to our table, leaving us feeling unfulfilled. \n\nI decided to give the chicken sagwala a try, but for the price of $14.95, I was expecting more than just a few measly chunks of chicken. And the naan, while tasty, was not enough to make up for the lackluster main dish. Overall, the food was just okay. I may give their buffet a try in the hopes of finding a dish that can redeem this dining experience, but I'm not holding my breath. \n\nThe only positive aspect was the contemporary decor and comfortable seating. But unfortunately, that was not enough to make up for the poor service and lackluster food. I would suggest the management work on improving their organization and service as well as revamping their menu. Until then, I'll have to look elsewhere for my Indian food fix."
1351,"This place is gross. I can see if I had a kid or 7, it would be some decent fun. But Idk, I went with a girl, and I could tell she thought the idea was cute and novel but would have much rather gotten coffee or something. I just felt germs on me, and the food here is for kids only, because they don't know any better. They to update everything and hire some new folks who can still smile and have fun with their job."

I stumbled upon this hidden gem after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp and boy, was it worth it! Located in a busy mall food court, this place may not seem like a typical spot for some authentic Thai food, but trust me, it will blow your taste buds away. And the best part? You can even take it to-go and enjoy it in the comfort of your own home!

I ordered the pad thai (medium spice level) and let me tell you, it was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. The level of complexity and depth in every bite was truly impressive. The heat was also no joke, so if you're not a fan of spicy food, I suggest going for a lower level. My partner loves spice and even he found the medium to be quite spicy. But hey, that's what makes it so exciting, right?

One thing to note is that this place only accepts cash. But trust me, it's worth the trip to an ATM. They also have affordable add-ons like spring rolls and fried spinach, and their soups may be small but they are definitely hearty with all the chicken and deliciousness packed into them.

Overall, this place may not have the fanciest ambiance or location, but it more than makes up for it with its amazing food. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for an authentic Thai meal that's miles away from the generic Thai Express. "
1353,"We stayed here for my girlfriends bachelorette in 2004.  Rooms were clean, bed was comfy. Pool area was nice.  Hardly in the room anyways so basically not much negative to say about it. Price was decent.  We all enjoyed our stay here being it was the best location on the strip."

I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Cobblestone Car Wash. I had purchased an upgraded wash and was looking forward to getting my car cleaned. However, when my car came out of the wash, I noticed that there were three attendants crowded around it. I didn't think much of it until I was called over to inspect my car. That's when I noticed two gouge marks and a sizable crack in my windshield. When I asked about it, the attendants seemed unsure of how it could have happened. They even tried to blame it on the Arizona heat and cold water from the wash (which is impossible in the middle of summer, by the way). Instead of taking responsibility, they immediately began asking if I had full coverage insurance. Talk about shady behavior. 

But the worst part was when I asked to speak with a manager. They reluctantly called someone over, but even then, they didn't admit any fault. They simply stated that they were unsure if the damage was there before the wash. It was clear that they were just trying to pass the blame onto someone else. To top it off, when I mentioned that I needed to make a phone call, the attendants scattered and never returned to check on me. It was as if they knew they were in the wrong and didn't want to face the consequences.

My experience at Cobblestone Car Wash was a nightmare. Not only did their negligence cause damage to my car, but they also had the audacity to try and charge my insurance for it. And the final cost for their carelessness? A whopping $269.99. I was lucky to receive a refund for my car wash, but that doesn't change the fact that I am now stuck paying for the repairs to my windshield. I would advise anyone considering using this car wash to think twice and use caution. They clearly have no respect for the vehicles they service, and it's not worth the risk or the financial burden. Save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere for your car wash needs."
1355,"Went to dinner tonight and it was different  from every other experience I have ever had at Pig & Pickle. This was just upsetting. The server didn't have much time for our table and actually let us know that. The food was good as usual, but the service ruined my night. I'm disappointed. Worst birthday dinner ever."
1356,"Totally unreliable and overpriced, pre booked a cab with discount to the airport for an early morning flight. Rang to confirm three hrs prior to pick up time and dispatch confirmed booking. But cab never showed. Rang dispatch and was told it was 10 mins away. Rang again after 15 mins and she told me she was trying to find someone to do the run. Obviously lied to me during my first call. She sounded like she was on Meth or something. I rang another company who showed up immediately and charged 15 dollars less than I was quoted by discount. I could have missed my flight. Save yourself this hassle and use another cab company"
1357,"I feel as though this place deserves maybe two and a half stars... it really wasn't that bad- it just wasn't that good either. \n\nCame for dinner with my husband. The only reason is we got into a conversation with one of the managers while we were gambleing at a hotel up the strip. He told us to go in and tell them he sent us for a round of drinks on the house. Sounded like a good idea so we went. I had margaritas, which were pretty standard tasting- nothing super exciting.  \n\nWe did have a table with a nice veiw of the strip so we were able to people watch (always entertaining in Vegas) \n\nThe food was decent. Again, nothing super exciting. Hubby had wings which were tasty and I had a chicken burrito. I enjoyed the one wing I stole from him and the chicken burrito was actually pretty tasty- though nothing about it was anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThe only thing that freaked me out? going into the ladies room to find a little woman lurking in the corner with an assortment of toiletries spread on the counter and a tip bowl for when she hands you a paper towel. Um. Random. I am perfectly capable of getting my own paper towel. And no, I will not tip you for that \""service\""."

I don't care if a commie or socialist or nazi eats there.\n\nThe owners are what concerns me most.\n\nI enjoyed the food the first time but when I ready they had the ass't governor holding some fricking prayer service there I was through.\n\nI don't care what any businesses politics are BUTT I don't want to hear or read about them.

This place was a major disappointment. I had high hopes while walking in, as the location seemed promising and the menu looked interesting. But unfortunately, my experience was far from enjoyable. The appetizers were microwaved, leaving them barely edible and unappetizing. I had to send back two dishes because they were just plain disgusting. And don't even get me started on the pastry puff, it was a complete disaster. As for the entree, I ordered the lamb and was extremely disappointed with the tough and barely edible meat. To top it off, the waitress argued with me about how they always prepare the dish and even claimed to eat it every day. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her. And the price? Absolutely outrageous for the poor quality of food. Not to mention, they advertised pine nuts in the dish but I could barely find a trace of them. Trust me, don't waste your hard-earned money on this overpriced and subpar restaurant. You'll leave feeling unsatisfied and regretting your decision. Definitely not worth the $60 I spent on three appetizers and one entree. What a disappointment."

I had a frustrating experience with this tire shop. I had purchased tires from them three years ago with a promised 60,000 mile warranty, but when I went in for a routine rotation, I was told that the tread was completely gone and I needed a new set. When they explained that the warranty was no longer valid in Arizona and suggested I get a new set of Michelin tires, I was skeptical. I decided to do some research and ended up purchasing Continental tires online which had a higher rating and were the same price. However, on the day of delivery, I was told that the tires were on backorder and I had to wait an additional 7 days. Frustrated, I went to the shop on the day of the install, only to find that I would not be receiving the promised discount because of a mistake made by the previous employee who wrote down 40K instead of 60K on the warranty. I was about ready to give up, until Justin and Paul stepped in and helped resolve the issue. They went above and beyond to correct the mistake and I was able to get the top-rated tires for my car without breaking the bank. Thank you Justin and Paul for saving the day! "
1361,"An overall good place, but a few bad experiences here. The music gets marginally more annoying each and every visit here. Kareoke jams sang on pianos, which can be fun at times, but eventually you need some real jams to wet your whistle. Drinks are normally priced, and it is usually pretty crowded. One of the bartenders confronted my friend for not tipping enough, which pretty much turned me off to the place (there are 2 bars where he had tabs, and he had tipped at the first one but not the second). The dude was really rude about it too. Overall I will agree with those who love the place, I can see why, but its not the best to frequent imo."
1362,"First let me start by saying - for a climate like ours, this town is lacking the good old classic ice cream stops. This place is just that. First - location is great for those that live or work downtown. Second- the hours are great, while there may be better frozen treats in the downtown area, this place is more accessible because it is open when you want to go. Second the ice cream is really good - just the classic good stuff that you want on a Friday night or a Monday afternoon (aka anytime of the day). My only bad comment - is that while the ice cream cookie sandwiches are good (good ice cream + tasty cookies), I wish they were made fresh to order. Because they sit in the freezer the cookies get cold and the ice cream becomes air dried. \n\nAll in all - good place to go when you just want a good old fashioned scoop of ice cream."

I was really excited to try out this restaurant, especially after seeing their unique special on the menu. It was my wife and I's first time here, so we were looking forward to a great dining experience. Unfortunately, things didn't go as smoothly as we had hoped. The pork dish we ordered came out rare, and despite the waiter's assurance that it was prepared that way intentionally, it was almost purple rare under the light. We had to send it back, which was a bit frustrating. On the bright side, we were given a ten dollar discount on our pitcher of sangria.

While the meal ended up being good once it was prepared correctly, the overall price was quite high in comparison to what we received. Our bill came out to around $100, and I couldn't help but think that I could have made a similar meal at home for a fraction of the cost. In the end, it was a decent dining experience, but not something I would rush back to. I would recommend trying it out for the unique menu options, but be aware of the potential for higher prices."

I visited the Thirsty Lion on a Friday evening after a long day of golf with some coworkers. We were looking forward to a relaxing dinner and drinks, but unfortunately, we were left feeling underwhelmed. Despite being told there would only be a 5 minute wait, it took over 15 minutes to be seated. And it would have been longer if we hadn't asked to sit outside ourselves.

Our server seemed disinterested and was just going through the motions. The burgers we ordered were less than desirable - my Tavern Burger, which I had requested medium, was overcooked and dry. It seemed like it had been pressed down with a spatula while cooking. And at $20 for a burger and beer, the value was not great.

Overall, I was disappointed with my experience at Thirsty Lion and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. The service and food were lackluster and the prices were high. Maybe it's better for a quick drink, but I wouldn't recommend it for a meal."
1365,"BBQ chicken salad was different, but very delicious, but the service was(how to explain) unsatisfactory. I was enjoying my plate and attempting to finish it all. The server comes around the corner and asks if I was done. I did not have half a second to answer and he just took the plate from the table. I was very shocked! I felt as he hated his job and so did the other male servers around the restaurant. My experience here was not enjoyable! I'd go to any other restaurant in town square, but this one ever again."

The next day I need to check out at 12 noon time at 10am the maid tried to get into my room I told her I am not leaving yet, at 10:45 am another call from the front desk when I am leaving I told them I will extend my saying for 2 hours extra, I was told it will cost me $20.00 and I have to pay in cash. I got to down town got something to eat tried to get into my room the card is not working, I need to pay prior, OK, I had paid I tried to get into the room, the access card is not working again, I go down get another card, the front desk lady confused my room number. Finally at 2pm I check out, they will not allow you to leave your belonging in the lobby, nor there is a rest room there. The breakfast was OK; the lady who served was very friendly. The only good thing is the location (walking distance to down town- Scottsdale), breakfast and the pool!!!"

I stumbled upon this store while looking for a new pair of boots and I have to say, I was quite impressed. The store was large and had an impressive selection of boots, which was perfect for my picky taste. I must have spent at least half an hour just browsing through the racks, and they seemed to never end with so many options to choose from. I was about to give up hope of finding the perfect pair, until I stumbled upon a rack against the wall with discounted boots at great prices.

As I continued to browse through the store, I couldn't help but notice the lack of interaction from any of the employees. While some may prefer to shop without being bothered, I personally appreciate some assistance or recommendations if I'm having trouble finding what I'm looking for. Nevertheless, I did come across a couple of shirts that caught my eye and were priced just right for my budget.

Overall, this store had a decent selection and good deals, but the lack of customer service did leave me feeling a bit disappointed. However, if you're someone who prefers to browse and shop at your own pace, then this might just be the perfect store for you."
1368,"I come to this Starbucks every day, thru the drive thru. And everyday they can never hear me, so I'm always repeating at least twice. I order the same drink every day, 8 times out 10, it tastes different. Same drink just something is always off day after day. So frustrating. The other HUGE deal, the drive thru is a ridiculous wait! Whether it be 3 cars or 10, give yourself at least 10 min to get thru the line, at least! \nUp here in southern Highlands there isn't a lot to choose from, with anything but I can guarantee if there was a coffee bean next store, I'd be there!"
1369,Bad service don't count on your reservation to be fulfilled. Horrible service. The workers acted as if they are above there guest because they work there! Someone needs to remind them they serve fried chicken. They are no better then someone who works at KFC!!! The manager is rude. The server did not want to split checks and turned mad when we asked him to do so. Tip: if you work in the hospitably business be hospitable! Prefer the location on Bethany home!!!!
1370," I was in the mood for something different, so I decided to try The Stuffed Forest's porridge.


I have mixed feelings about my recent visit to The Stuffed Forest. While the service was top-notch and the prices were fair, I have to admit that the hype around their sweet cream pancakes left me a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty and all, but not quite the birthday cake-like experience I was expecting. However, their country fried steak more than made up for it. As someone from the mid-west, I can attest that they truly nail the crispy on the outside, tender on the inside combo. And let's not forget about their hash browns - a perfect match for some Heinz 57 sauce. \n\nThe atmosphere here is definitely unique, with a lumberjack-like vibe and adorable teddy bears scattered throughout. It's the perfect spot for a hearty country breakfast. My only critique would be that the restaurant can get pretty crowded, making for a bit of a wait. But really, when you leave here with a happy, full stomach, that's all that matters. Overall, I would recommend giving The Stuffed Forest a try, but maybe stick to the classic dishes for the full experience."

The atmosphere of this restaurant was definitely a breath of fresh air. The decor was modern and inviting, and the staff was incredibly welcoming. We couldn't help but snap some photos of the vibrant space. However, the menu selection was a bit lacking. While my friends enjoyed their meals, I found that the descriptions could have been more informative. But despite that, the initial warm and fuzzy feeling lingered throughout our meal. It wasn't until we noticed the doors staying open and a chill creeping in that we realized the staff may have overlooked the temperature. Despite that chilly ending, I would still consider coming back to try some other dishes."

I had heard great things about this Chicago themed breakfast spot in the Smith's shopping center. With its wide selection of omelets and a family-friendly atmosphere, I was excited to try it out. However, my experience fell short of my expectations. The service was no frills and it was difficult to get water refills. Despite being a ""family-owned business"", the staff seemed to be lacking a sense of warmth and hospitality. 

The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the #20 Polish Omelet and was disappointed to find it bland and lacking in flavor. My partner's ham and egg plate was nothing special either. While the food wasn't terrible, it definitely did not live up to the hype I had heard. 

The d√©cor and atmosphere were also underwhelming. It felt like they were trying to appeal to families with young children, but even the kids seemed bored by the lackluster environment. And despite the name, there were dinner menus available, which just added to the confusing concept of this place. 

In the end, I left feeling unsatisfied and with a sense that this place was just going through the motions without putting in much effort. Perhaps it would be better suited for a quick, no-frills breakfast, but I wouldn't recommend it as a memorable dining experience. Save your money and try somewhere else in the neighborhood."
1373,"I really wanted to like this place, it looked so promising.  Three of us went on Sunday afternoon using a coupon for a free entree.  The best part of the meal was the pesto & garlic butter which came with the basket of bread.\n\nI could not decide what to get and the waitress recommended the house made Tortellini with ricotta and marinated in marinara and alfredo sauce, she said it was not heavy.  Well, it was over heavy and I could not taste the Tortellini because it was swimming in the sauce which tasted not very good.  I sent it back.  We also ordered the Lasagna with meatballs which was swimming in marinara sauce and also was just average nothing to rave about.  Also ordered the Penne Caprese - beware of this - it is very very spicy and will burn your mouth if you are not prepared....also the balsamic vinegar on the top does not work well with this dish.  After I sent my Tortellini back, I wanted to try something else to give them the benefit....I ordered the Portabella Penne not real sure why it is called this as there are no mushrooms in it....this was in-edible....not able to eat loaded with garlic, I love garlic eat it everyday, this tasted like it was drenched in white wine and they used the whole bag of garlic - everyone at the table tried it and no one could eat it........we also ordered the breaded ravioli's for an appetizer...could not taste the ravioli because the bread was too thick......the meatball are very heavy and I did not like them, more like rocks than meatballs and a little on the spicy side..\n\nLike I said in the beginning the best part of the meal was the Butter in the Bread Basket.........We were also disappointed that they sell Atlantic Salmon which is farm raised and loaded with chemicals, toxins and bacteria, all Atlantic Salmons is farm raised but they did not seem to know this, go figure...\n\nthe decor is real nice and the booths were very comfortable.

I was really excited to visit Toy Shack for the first time, especially after hearing about it on Pawn Stars. The store was filled with toys from my childhood and I was eager to take a trip down memory lane. However, my experience at Toy Shack was a bit underwhelming. Maybe it was because I had just stuffed myself silly at the Heart Attack Grill, but I couldn't fully appreciate all the nostalgic toys on display.

While I appreciate the variety of toys available, I found the pricing to be a bit confusing. Some of the older toys were understandably priced higher, but I was disappointed to see some newer toys being sold for varying prices when they are easily accessible in regular retail stores.

But the real letdown was when I saw the massive Star Wars section. As a die-hard fan, I was hoping to find some rare and unique items to add to my collection. But unfortunately, I left empty-handed as I couldn't fully focus on the toys due to my food coma. I'll definitely be back to Toy Shack during my next trip to Vegas, but this time with an empty stomach and a full wallet. If you're a toy enthusiast like me, it's definitely worth a visit."

I'm new to the Toyota brand, all my past experience has been with German companies, so I'm not sure if this is normal with Toyota, but I feel the diagnosis they provided was not correct as many of they things they advised were just done.  This alone still would not have given me reason enough to write a bad review, however on top of that the service is just poor.  Fortunately its an extra vehicle so I could just leave it there.  I really don't even want to deal with these people. One of these days I'll get the energy to go back and deal with the wait times and poor service, but for now my 4runner can sit there."

1378,"I would give this place no stars if I could. Sat at the counter thinking we could grab a quick bite. The place wasn't packed, a few customers but by no means busy. Sat there for about 5 minutes, no menus, no \""hey, be with you in a sec,\"" not even eye contact as they walk right in front of you! Literally, 3 servers walked right past us as if we weren't even there. The manager and a server stood by the cash register (which is probably 5 feet from where we were sitting) and talked to each other the whole time. Needless to say, we got up and walked out.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go eat at the Sundance Grill in the same casino. The burgers there are awesome and you'll probably get served in this lifetime."

Oh, the Luxor More Buffet. What a disappointment. After hearing from locals that this was the best buffet in town, my expectations were high. But unfortunately, they fell flat. Both the lunch and dinner buffet offered the same bland and tasteless dishes, with the only difference being a few cocktail shrimp added to the dinner session.

The service, however, was excellent. Our plates were cleared quickly and our drinks were always refilled. But unfortunately, the overall dining experience was ruined by the dingy and dated appearance of the dining area. It's clear that Luxor could use a cosmetic upgrade to bring some life into this lackluster buffet.

I suppose I should have known better than to take advice from locals on where to eat. Lesson learned. Next time, I'll be sure to ask the tourists for their recommendations. As for Luxor's More Buffet, I won't be returning anytime soon. Save your money and go elsewhere for a better dining experience."

The boys 2 men concert at this theater was a blast from the past! As a fan of their music from the 90s and 80s, I was excited to see them live. And let me tell you, they still have it. Their performance was spot on and they interacted well with the audience. It was a trip down memory lane as they sang all their classic hits.

However, the seating at this venue was a bit of a disappointment. The seats were much smaller in width compared to a movie theater seat. So if you're on the husky side like me, be prepared to feel pretty uncomfortable throughout the show. It was a struggle to find a comfortable position, which took away from the overall experience.

Overall, I would definitely go see Boys 2 Men again, but I might opt for a different venue next time. While their performance was top-notch, the uncomfortable seating was a major drawback. Hopefully, they'll switch to a more spacious venue for future shows."

Gotta love a \""spa\"" where the staff pops a squat outside and lights up before you've even driven away. Save the trip."
1385,"Every time I decide to get lunch from M&S, I think I'm in for a treat, and then by the time I get here I've remembered that they don't make nearly as many different sandwiches as they used to and what they DO make is pretty... meh.  \n\nThey used to have great wraps, avocado sandwiches, brie and grape, tasty tastiness.  In the place of the tasty tastiness they have lots and lots and lots of pasta salad type things.  Now I realise I just listed avocado and brie as sandwich choices but have you SEEN the health information on those pasta salads??  They're like, 2/3 of your daily intake.  That's narsty.\n\nAdditionally, the lines in here can be incredible.  Points for the staff for dealing with it quickly, but man at lunch it's absolutely ridiculous.  \n\nSo... I'm just really not that keen on M&S anyway, but poor lunch selection paired with ridiculous lines makes this place 2 stars at lunch time and 3 stars the rest of the time."

I was excited to try this popular, hip restaurant that everyone raves about. I brought my husband for a date night, only to be disappointed by the lackluster experience. Despite the positive reviews, we were one of the only couples dining in the restaurant.

As we waited to be seated, we noticed that the hostess station was unattended and the few tables that were occupied seemed to be experiencing the same issue. After a few minutes of awkwardly standing there, we were finally seated at a dirty table. I couldn't believe it - I had to clean it myself before we could even sit down.

We ordered the barbecue sandwich and french fries, which were decent but nothing special. What truly caught my eye were the tsoynami's, with their unique flavor combinations and option to create your own. I was excited to try it, but unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype.

Aside from the subpar food, the service was unimpressive. Our server seemed uninterested in taking our order and was overall unattentive. It was clear that they were understaffed, leading to a lack of quality service.

I was disappointed by my experience at this restaurant that I had heard so much about. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I couldn't help but feel let down by the overall lack of effort and attention to detail. Unfortunately, I won't be returning and can't understand how this place continues to stay in business."
1387,"

After reading the reviews, I should have known better than to go to this restaurant. The service was subpar, following the trend of other negative reviews. But what really bothered me was the sneaky CNF charge on our bill. Apparently, it was for ""live music"" that we never even got to hear. When I asked about it, the manager pointed to some sign at the front that we never saw. Clearly, this place is just trying to scam customers for more money. And the food? Not worth the overpriced menu items. My fish was tough and lacked flavor. Plus, who charges for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant? It's ridiculous. Overall, a complete disappointment and a waste of money. Next time, I'll be sure to read the reviews before deciding to dine here. "
1388,"One of the better Learn to swim facilities but still needs improvement.\n\nAt 9 months it was time for my little dude to get acclimated with swimming. After searching around and visiting a few swim schools in town, this location was one of the better schools.\n\nI found getting into classes that suited my time schedule wasn't to hard but being flexible to move to another day or missing a class and making it up was extremely difficult. \n\nAfter a few months of attending water wings my son had to miss a few weeks as being out of town etc, the school offers you a make up class as they require you to pay monthly, unfortunately if you cannot make up the class you will still be charged for the classes. I had two weeks in a row where I cancelled the class with fair notice, because we we're out of town we could not make up the class yet they still charged full price.\n\nThe classes were great, my son really loved the instructor Amber. She was fantastic and i would  recommend her for any level or age group.\n\nA negative about this swim school is they let the kids play around after there classes in the walk in section. I'm ok with it, but a lot of the kids in classes are distracted by the other kids playing and no longer engage into there class. Unfortunately this is one of the reasons I had to pull my son out,as the whole class he and other kids wanted to play.\n\nThe front desk girls are ok but on occasions can be extremely rude to customers, although they were nice to me, I did see it on a few occasions with others."

This Culver's exceeded my expectations. As soon as I walked in, the friendly staff made me feel welcomed. The restaurant was immaculately clean and well-maintained. I was pleasantly surprised when my food was brought to my table in only 5 minutes, and it was hot and fresh, exactly as I had ordered. As a frequent visitor of Culver's, I can confidently say that this location stands out as the best I have ever eaten at. I will definitely be bringing my family back here for more delicious meals."

My go-to order here is the vegan breakfast burrito - it's packed with flavorful and fresh ingredients. The tofu scramble is also a hit with my vegetarian friends. And of course, I can't forget to mention their bottomless mimosas at an unbeatable price. It's the perfect complement to a leisurely brunch. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with mismatched vintage furniture and charming decorations. It can get pretty crowded on the weekends, but the cozy and intimate ambiance makes up for it. However, I have to dock off some points for the service. The staff is friendly, but sometimes the wait for a table can be longer than expected, and it can take a while to get our food. Nonetheless, the delicious food and relaxing atmosphere keep me coming back. Overall, Tin Front Cafe is a solid choice for brunch, just be prepared to take your time and enjoy the wait. "

I recently visited this restaurant and it was an experience I will never forget - in the worst way possible. From the moment we walked in, we were bombarded with loud music and flashy music videos playing on the big screen. It was like being in a frat party gone wrong. We had to shout our orders at the server, who seemed more interested in watching the music videos than taking our order. And to top it off, my steak was just bland and thin, as if it came straight out of a TV dinner. I should have known better than to expect good food from a place that prioritizes water slides and stilt performances over serving their customers. And to make matters worse, I felt sick to my stomach afterwards. It's safe to say I won't be returning to this bizarre freak show of a restaurant. Save your money and your sanity by avoiding this place."

I had high hopes for this restaurant, especially after hearing all the hype surrounding it. However, my experience here left much to be desired. The location, tucked away in a shopping plaza, may have contributed to its lackluster appearance, but I was disappointed by the food as well. It seemed like the guide books may have been paid to promote this place, as the food did not live up to its stellar reputation. Maybe I just came in with too high expectations, but I was left wanting something more.

We visited for lunch and opted for the buffet in order to sample a variety of dishes. While there were some decent options, a majority of the dishes lacked protein and were just an overload of noodles, rice, and veggies. To make matters worse, some of the buffet items were not replenished in a timely manner, as we visited towards the end of lunch service. The service itself was pleasant, but not very attentive. We had to hunt down our own napkins and had a hard time getting someone to bring us the check.

Upon my second visit, I tried their burger (and paid extra for fries) and was again underwhelmed. The burger itself was nothing special and the salad I had on my first visit was disappointing as well. It claims to have chopped ahi, avocado, and cashews, but I could barely find any of those ingredients in the massive bowl of oily lettuce. The saving grace of this place was the beer - cold and expertly poured. But that alone cannot make up for the lack of quality in their food. So, if you're just looking for a place to grab a quick cold one, this could work. But for a proper meal, I suggest looking elsewhere."
1393,"We never actually tasted the food because we walked in and no one spoke to us. We found someone walking by and they told us to sit anywhere. The five tables along the wall when you walk in were disturbingly dirty. Dishes covered the tables, and on the floor were half eaten chicken wing bones. It was appalling. We stood and waited for almost 20 minutes for someone to clean the tables, but this didn't happen. After 30 minutes, we finally left. No one had spoke to us nor had they cleaned any of the tables. I can't comment on their food, but if their establishment is this vile, imagine the kitchen."
1394,"The place is literally a combat zone in the evenings.  So packed with people it's impossible to keep clean.  A steamy, dishroom atmosphere pervades the place.  Most of the help are of questionable US citizenship.  The food reminds me of a USMC chow hall on a bad day.  I'll give this place 2 stars for one reason:  They give vets a free meal on Veterans Day."
1395,Stay away from this place.  We got bottle service for a friend's bachelor party and they switched the table we booked for an inferior one and we had to pay an extra $1k. They were acting extremely dishonest the wheel time. Avoid this host Kevin and his underling Josh. \n\nThe night afterwards was OK but I have had much better experiences at marquee and XS. Will not be coming back period.
1396,"I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the high volume of staff to keep things moving.  It was busy, but the service remained fast and friendly regardless of the high volume of people there.\n\nWhat I didn't love was the salad and the lack of discussion about what I was ordering.  They prepared me a small salad, I wanted a large but couldn't tell what they were doing.  Once I realized it was a small it was too late.  Also, the added items (chicken, egg, tomato, etc) was WAY too small of a serving for a lunch.  I was less than two bites of chicken - maybe 1-2ounces total..  and about 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg.  I'm not a big eater - but I was pretty hungry when I left the restaurant.  Also - WAY too much dressing - it was drowning in dressing.\n\nThey were so focused on keeping the line moving (and I understand they need to get people through at lunchtime), but they didn't take enough time to let me make decisions about my order.  Large salad, not small.  Extra chicken please.  LESS dressing, etc.  \n\nIt could  be great if they improved the service at the counter and actually gave people a moment to order what they want... and if they consider actually adding a decent serving of ingredients to the salads."
1397,"Stay here if you like:\n\n* Homogenized, cookie cutter people.\n* Fake body parts:  Chins, breasts, hair\n* Reruns of MTVs The Grind.\n* SPRING BREAK, WHOO!\n* Frat parties.\n* Paying too much just so you could say you've been there.\n* Nice enough rooms, but, again, far too expensive.\n* Roofies.  Ecstacy.  GBH.  Other horrible mind altering substances.\n* Lack of conversation.\n* Groping and/or being groped.\n* Top 40 music.\n* Camera crews shooting for made-for-cable shows and gettin' all in your way.\n\nI kinda have a lot of disdain for this place, the type of people who flock here, and the amount of money they charge to be surrounded by these people.  The theatres are OK as is the margarita brunch.  The rest of it could fall off the world and I wouldn't care."
1398,"Worst place ever. How can a Mexican feel so out of place at a Mexican restaurant? Food was awful.

Our \""movie nite\"" got cancelled because we had to run home because we got shits. Never going back again!"

I have to give a huge shoutout to Cindy and Bill for their amazing service at this facility. We were in a bit of a bind with our cross country move and they truly saved the day. I can't say enough about how helpful and accommodating they were throughout the entire process. Not only did they assist us with all the necessary paperwork and communication, but they also went out of their way to help with some last minute issues with the moving company. Their dedication and willingness to assist in any way possible truly made a stressful situation much more manageable.

The facility itself is also very well-maintained and organized. The units are clean and spacious, and the staff is always available to address any concerns or questions. However, I did notice that the pricing is a bit on the higher side compared to other facilities in the area. But, given the exceptional service we received, I believe it is worth the extra cost.

The only reason I am not giving this place a higher rating is because we did encounter a few issues with our unit upon move-in. There were some minor damages and the key card system was not working properly. However, the staff was quick to address these issues and resolve them to the best of their ability.

Overall, I highly recommend this facility for anyone in need of storage services. You can trust that Cindy and Bill will take great care of you and your belongings. They truly make a stressful moving process a little bit easier, and for that, I am extremely grateful. "
1400,"We made a reservation for 14 people for a birthday dinner the night before we went, but they didn't even take down our reservation and we had to wait an HOUR AND A HALF on a Thursday night. The girl just kept making excuses about how no one told her about the reservation and suggested if we want to stand up off to the side and eat our food there. CMON, really? just chill off to the side and eat while standing for a birthday dinner? Who even thinks of these kinds of things? We finally got seated a quarter after 10, and the food wasn't even worth our wait. They recently changed their pizza menu, and got rid of the BBQ pizza. I ordered 3 different pizzas to share with a friend, and only one was worth paying for. Marguerita pizza was good, bacon&eggs and genovese were not. They were so salty and the bacon&eggs had only one egg on it. Also, the egg yolk was hard, not runny, like the pizzas I saw on other people's plates. So conclusion is, I probably wouldn't go here for weekday late nights anymore, and the new menu sucks. Not to mention their service. I thought they would at least bring us a free pitcher of juice or something for making us wait an hour and a half after making a reservation. But nope."
1401,"I usually give nice reviews.\n\nI understand the issues of a new, start-up restaurant.\n\nI know that Bink's will figure out that they need a few compelling menu items...as the limited offering, at this stage of the game, is odd. (After close scrutiny, there was nothing that 'spoke' to me on the menu.  I order an appetizer for my entr\u00e9e.)\n\nPortions were small...and made even smaller by the tiny plate the food was served on.\n\nThe \""NEVER AGAIN\"" was a result of the manager...and the server...under-estimating my intelligence and experience.\n\nI ordered a Stoli martini.  No Stoli...so I changed it to Kettle.  No special instructions..other than I wanted it stirred not shaken...I hate ice chips and a watery drink. \n\nFive minutes later, a frothing, bubbling, smoking drink was served to me.  There was 1/8 of an inch of hard ice underneath the smoke produced by either dry ice...or ???  It was a drink some schmuck would order on a cruise ship.\n\nI asked the manager...who was strolling around... to take the drink back...and please give me a straight Kettle..up.  Another five minutes goes by, and, supposedly, a new drink was delivered.\n\nI noticed that the vodka was very, very cold.  Having consumed thousands of \""up\"" martini's, I have a good idea of how cold vodka can get when stirred in a shaker over ice.  This drink was much, much colder than I have ever had before.  \n\nI also observed that there was a definite line on the rim of the glass that was obviously where the ice had formed from the stupid drink they first served.  I asked the manager...and the server...if they had just scrapped the top off the first drink and re-served it.\n\n\""Oh no...We dumped the first drink and made you a fresh one!\""\n\nThat my dear reader, is a fib.  When further questioned, the server said, \""Well...we used the same glass from the first drink...and made you a new one. That's why the line was on the rim\""\n\nIn my humble opinion...They didn;t tell the truth.  What I believe they did...was scrape the ice off the first drink and delivered it back to me.  I would bet $500.00 that was what happened.\n\nSo...I will never return.  The food, service, etc., was fine considering the new opening of this place.  The fact that the manager and the server thought I was dumb enough to NOT KNOW a real martini from a screwed up first drink, INSULTED MY INTELLIGENCE.\n\nI guess I wish them good luck, however, I would never return and will take every opportunity to trash the place for the fib I believe I was expected to buy.  \n\nBetter hurry...as they can;t last long.\n\nRule 1...NEVER, EVER go cheap.  If the first drink was not right...make me a new one in a clean glass."
1402,Of all the food experiences while staying at the palazzo this was the worst. Staff seemed to be rushing us and then we couldn't find them. Next thing we knew they were closing down and it was still early. Seems when the last game is over they shut it down. Tried again another night to go down for a drink and it was already closed as well. Food was mediocre and not something I'd rec. good place to watch a game (when they're on) and there is a sports book desk if you want to bet but I'd eat elsewhere and get here early.
1403,"This was my choice for lunch to go last Wednesday.  I have been in this location at least a dozen times.  It always seems to be pretty busy (and noisy).  Today I chose the Sweet Fire chicken and the Honey Walnut shrimp, both items are not on their standard menu.  As usual I got the chow mein with mine, it is easier to eat with chop sticks than rice.  The food and service were fine and I was definitely full when finished."
1404,"The people in the valley have become too use to bad food. Their taste buds are non exsistant. I'm a pastry student, no not going to work in Az after graduation, so I couldn't care less about how popular this company is. A friend brought me some cupcakes from this place, with the exception of the dark chocolate cupcakes, they were NASTY. the coconut cupcakes tasted like flour; the strawberry had no taste; they were dense and heavy. A friend of mine, who has an iron stomach, had severe stomach pains. I'm not trying to be mean, but every single person that I gave a cupcake to, hated them. When my friend told me the price of a dozen, I almost choked on my tongue. These people are marketing gods if they can get people to think that they have quality product"

My expectations weren't high when I wandered into this store. The employees seemed to be lacking in basic customer service skills, with the guy at the counter being the main culprit. Not one word or smile from him, as he was too busy on his phone to even acknowledge my presence. And because he didn't have a beard, I couldn't even use my typical greeting of ""Salaam Alaikum."" Talk about a missed opportunity for some genuine interaction.

I decided to grab a bite at the cafe and while the prices were good, the samosa was outrageously spicy. The biriyani was decent though, with a satisfying portion size. But let's talk about the meat selection - or lack thereof. Every time I've been here, there's never any lamb available. So I usually just settle for chicken breast and ground beef. Not exactly a diverse dinner menu.

However, I did manage to find a delicious tikka masala paste that I can use to make my own chicken tikka masala at home. It's just a shame that it's always out of stock, or hidden amongst all the other flavors of the same brand. Not exactly convenient.

In the end, the only redeeming factor of this store was the affordable prices. But even that couldn't make up for the lack of customer service and subpar selection. I had high hopes for this place, but alas, they were not met. Maybe next time they can try living up to their slogan and actually be America's Friendliest Store."
1406,"It was good. It wasn't outrageously great, but it wasn't horrendously bad. \n\nI ordered the Turkey & Rosemary Omelet and my boyfriend ordered the French Toast Strata. \n\nMy meal came with an omelet, oven-roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. While everything was good, I have to say that I probably could have made the meal at home. If I go back, I wouldn't not eat this again, but I would definitely like to try something from their lunch selection first. My boyfriend was pretty much in agreement there. While he said his meal was good, he wants to try their burgers. \n\nThey have a nice size menu filled with lots of veggie and lean meat dishes, which are perfect for me. However, they also cater to my boyfriend's style with such dishes like the Wisconsin Pride Burger (cheese curds and bacon on top of a 1/2 lb burger). \n\nWe actually went their for breakfast for my boyfriends birthday. With that in mind, we left with a cupcake (I passed; too full to even think about cupcakes). My boyfriend chose the carrot cupcake with cream cheese frosting and walnut bits sprinkled on top. He wolfed it down and said it was good. \n\nI may update this review after we go for lunch sometime."
1407,---------DINNER ONLY------\nKicked off a work event with my co-workers here. The food was good but it wasn't memorable. It's loud and a great place to get together with friends (typical Vegas place). It's inside the Cosmo hotel on the floor with all the other restaurants. All the restaurants seem to have waits but this one never does. It's an okay place but I'd probably try another restaurant before coming back here
1408,"

Just had a late brunch here with a group of friends and while the atmosphere was great, I have to say the food was a bit underwhelming. Maybe it's just my meat-loving taste buds, but I found the vegan options to be lacking in flavor and variety. I appreciate the healthy options, but they all seemed to blend together and lacked a distinct taste. Kudos to those who can eat this type of food regularly, but it just doesn't do it for me. Plus, the prices were a bit on the steep side. $8.88 for a smoothie? Come on, that's a bit excess. And to top it off, I've been feeling a bit queasy since our meal. While I know it takes some adjustment to get used to raw food, I don't believe it should make us feel ill. Overall, I'm glad we tried this place, but it's safe to say I won't be coming back anytime soon."
1409,"By far the worst place to live in all of Phoenix/Arizona. I would NEVER recommend anyone to live at this apartment complex. The parking is ATROCIOUS as they NEVER have parking spots available past 8pm. There is no street parking, so if you cannot find a spot you are SOL. The managament is the WORST that I have ever dealt with, as they take FOREVER in assessing any fees or fines. I moved out in 2010 and received a fee in 2012 for a \""cleaning\"" that they needed to do, even though they signed us out of the apartment and have other tennets living in the apartment that I occupied. \nThe management, especially Lisa Nolle, are EXTREMELY unprofessional and are as rude as can be. They are never clear on what they are charging you for and they could care less about any problem that you are having. All they are interested in is your money, not your well being. If they cared about me half as much as they care about my money, I'd never move out. Let me just say, not living at this apartment anymore is the BEST thing that's ever happened to me.\nI would not recommend anyone to live here. It's a waste of money and is a terrible apartment complex. There are 50 other places that I would recommend to live. There is NOTHING around this apartment complex (food, entertainment, etc.), so living here is like living in an annex. \nDo yourself a favor and DO NOT live here."
1410,"Lets just make this short and sweet... I only come to Zia if I cant find what I'm looking for at Stinkweeds or Eastside. It's rare, but sometimes the smaller local shops don't always have what my little ears desire. Today I ventured in after 2 failed attempts searching for a specific CD. Yes, I might be the only person in the universe who still purchases actual CD's rather than Mp3's.. but I like to hold things. And to be held. I also like long walks down the boulevard and chocolate covered strawberries, but that is beside the point. \n\nZia is cool. They have good sales and I actually ended up scoring one today for $5 off one of the selections I chose. Cant beat that. The joint totally reminds me of Newbury Comics in good ol' Boston, not only do they have tons of tunes, but they have sweet schwag like corn dog flavored lip gloss, bacon band-aids, wack ass Asian toys, posters, key chains and clothing. The dudes at this specific location were cool. I didn't really need any assistance with anything, but they made sure I found what I was looking for.. \n\nIts certainly not my *favorite* record store in the valley, but its not so bad and they will probably have what you want."

This burger at the bar was nothing short of a disappointment. The toppings were sparse and the patty itself was small and dry. And don't even get me started on the price - $25 for a burger at a strip mall? Absurd. I was expecting something special considering the hype surrounding this place, but my taste buds were not satisfied. The bun was nothing impressive and the fries were nothing to write home about. This was not the work of art that I had been promised. Save your money and go elsewhere for a truly satisfying burger experience. Definitely not worth the trip or the price.

They were doughy and sticky, and when we informed out waiter, he agreed with us that it was not fully cooked, but made no move to return the dish to the kitchen until we requested that it be at the very least warmed up to a degree in which it was actually edible. \n\nI had the sea bass, which was mediocre and somehow different from the other wonderful times I had ordered this delightful dish - it lacked the explosively delicious flavors. The curry that was ordered was the worst - completely and wholly NOT recommended. The rice was tough (probably not fully cooked once again), and the spices were arbitrary to the chicken itself, as though they were thrown in after the chicken was already cooked. \n\nGiven the price of Soba dishes, the bill certainly took a plunge into our wallets, but sadly with no degree of satisfaction for our taste buds or stomachs."

My wife and I had been regulars at this establishment for years, even hosting our anniversary dinner there. The drinks were always strong and delicious, and the food used to be top notch. But after my recent experience, I can confidently say that this restaurant has lost a loyal customer.

For starters, the fajitas were a huge disappointment. The beef was tough and lacked any flavor whatsoever. I could barely taste any spices or peppers, and the lack of onions and red peppers made it clear that quality is no longer a priority for this chain. And the portion size? Laughable. We ordered an extra beef order to share, but there was barely enough black beans for one taco, let alone two. And the guac and sour cream were a joke - enough for one measly Taco Bell taco, not the upscale Mexican cuisine we were promised.

But the real kicker was the drink prices. We had four margaritas, and I was shocked to see that our bill came out to $32 for those four drinks. $8 for what tasted like watered down lime juice? I could have gone to a top shelf restaurant and gotten a better deal. It's clear that this establishment cares more about profits than customer satisfaction.

The service was also severely lacking. Not only was our waiter difficult to understand due to a heavy accent, but management clearly did not have a handle on the chaos of the large party in the same room. It was loud and disruptive, and I couldn't even have a conversation with my wife without shouting.

But the worst part of all was what happened after my wife's passing. I had made arrangements in the morning with the owner for her passing later that evening. When I returned to say my final goodbyes, the owner had left without ever acknowledging my presence. He even discussed important details of my wife's passing with the mourners, completely disregarding me as the designated point of contact. This lack of respect and compassion is unforgivable.

In the end, I can't imagine ever returning to this establishment. They clearly have no regard for their customers and are only concerned with making a quick profit. There are plenty of other options in the Mexican food industry, and I urge you to choose a restaurant that values their customers and their experiences. Save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere. Don't waste your time or your money on a place that clearly doesn't appreciate your business. "

I decided to give this place another chance after my previous disappointing experience, but unfortunately, I was met with even more disappointment. It seems like all the good staff have left, leaving behind a lackluster team. This time, I went for a wax and it was a rush job. The woman, Katie, seemed annoyed that I was even there, as if I was holding up her day. She gave me a quick glance in the dimly lit room, leaving me to discover all the missed spots at home. To make matters worse, my go-to hair stylist and massage therapist are no longer working there, so I have no reason to continue going back. The morale of the staff and quality of service have greatly declined, making for a disappointing and uncomfortable experience. It's a shame because I used to enjoy this place, but now I'll have to find a new salon and spa."

Overall, our stay at this hotel was a bit of a letdown. We had high expectations, but unfortunately, they were not met. First of all, we were disappointed to find out that the pool was under construction during our visit. It would have been nice to have been informed of this before booking our stay. On top of that, our room's TV did not work properly and the internet access came at a steep price of $9.00. We also had to pay a $20 resort fee, which didn't seem justified after experiencing these issues.

We did enjoy breakfast at the D grill, which was delicious and the valet staff and bellman were excellent. However, the constant presence of homeless individuals outside the hotel asking for money made us feel a bit uncomfortable.

To make matters worse, when we asked about the resort fee, we were told it covered a half price show ticket. But when we tried to use it, we found out it wasn't really half price. It's frustrating to pay for something that isn't accurately represented.

Overall, the hotel seemed to fall short on some key aspects and we were left feeling disappointed. With so many other great options in the area, we will most likely skip this hotel on our next visit."
1417,"Frankly I was just disappointed with Baton Rouge. \n\nIn sequence:\n- the Manhattan I ordered was watery and weak\n- the spinach dip was not cooked thoroughly and when it was taken back, they returned it after only reheating it in the microwave\n- the staff was cool but not overwhelming, especially with several occasions to provide good customer service\n- the filet was good, but not prime quality\n\nFor those south of the border, think Hillstone's/Houston's but with lower quality results."

I had high hopes for Caribbean Fusion, but unfortunately, the menu did not meet my expectations. As soon as I walked in, I was surprised to see Italian-style pasta dishes and American side dishes on the menu. I was even more surprised when the server told me they also served beef patties - my old Caribbean favorite that was not mentioned anywhere on the menu.

As a lover of authentic Jamaican cuisine, I was thrilled to see some classic dishes on the menu. However, I couldn't help but feel disappointed by the lack of traditional options and the addition of non-Caribbean dishes. I ended up ordering the Jerk Pork, which was flavorful but unfortunately, a bit tough. The plantains, however, were a saving grace and kept me satisfied.

But the biggest letdown was when I found out they also served beef patties. I immediately abandoned my original order and gave them a try. They were delicious and reminded me of the ones I used to eat in Jamaica. But I couldn't help but wonder why they weren't listed on the menu. It almost seemed like they were trying to hide their best dish.

Perhaps with some menu tweaking and a narrower selection of authentic Caribbean dishes, Caribbean Fusion could reach its full potential. And I have to give a shoutout to their amazing mojitos, which definitely added some color to an otherwise lackluster dining experience.

In the meantime, I'll be sticking to my favorite Caribbean restaurant down the street. But hey, at least I found a new spot for drinks! "

We decided to check out this place after hearing about their famous bull riding nights. We were excited to experience something new, but unfortunately, it was a let down. The atmosphere was cool and there weren't too many people, but that's about the only positive thing I can say. We went inside to get drinks and the first sign of disappointment was when our waitress barely acknowledged us. She seemed to have zero interest in serving us and had no problem making us feel invisible. When we couldn't get any answers from her, we tried speaking to another waitress, who unfortunately had the same attitude. It was clear that the managers need to do some serious training in customer service because not even a fake smile was given. We asked about the stage and the bands playing that night, but they seemed to have no clue. How is that possible for a place that supposedly hosts live music? It was clear we weren't welcomed there. After just one drink, we decided to leave and take our money somewhere that actually values their customers. What a shame, we were really looking forward to a fun night out. "
1420,"THEHotel used to be my favorite suite only hotel on the strip. Good service, great rooms, good layout of the hotel.\n\nAll of that is gone.\n\nNow as the Delano, they are in the process of redecorating everything. They took what used to be a nice, open, airy lobby and boxed it all in. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it will look better once the construction is done,  but it is all too contemporary now for my taste.\n\nThe rooms are like being in an institution, almost florescent white everything with modern, uncomfortable furniture. I didn't have problems with my pillows, but some other people we were staying with did. I felt them for myself, they were hard as concrete. The closets? What were they thinking! The bar goes horizontal so you can't see what you have hung up. On one side, they put a safe on a shelf right below it, so you can't even hang anything up. Who designed this?\n\nThere are a FEW pluses that keep this from being one star. The bathroom. It hasn't changed except for the wall paper and the lighting and the brand of bath products. They have the most awesome, deep, bathtub with a waterfall spout. My favorite thing to do is to get some products from LUSH in the MB shops and soak in the bath while watching TV. They have also upgraded the TV to look more like what you would have at home, HD and a guide to look at instead of just channel numbers. Definitely an improvement there.\n\nThe cost of room service has tripled. We ordered dessert; a peach crumble a la mode and an ice cream. $37 WITHOUT tip! For the side of ice cream, they brought us up an entire pint. What a waste. Not to mention is took an hour and a half to get to us. Good thing we weren't waiting on dinner.\n\nThey also tried to charge me with 2 mini bar items that I never even touched. We didn't have housekeeping the entire 3 days we were there, so even if we DID partake in the overpriced items they stock in there, there was no way they could of known until after we checked out.\n\nI understand that the hotel is in transition phase. I hope that hotel management takes these concerns seriously and improves things before the hotel debuts in the fall. However, I imagine that this will no longer be my go-to Vegas hotel."
1421,"This was the first spot is where our lunch crew was born. The burgers were good, but you can get better burgers for your buck in the valley.

Our group was looking for a place to stop and grab some brunch before exploring the city on a beautiful Saturday morning. Based on recommendations from the concierge, we decided to give this place a try. However, upon arrival, we were disappointed to find out that the brunch menu was actually only available on Sundays. It would have been nice if this information was conveyed to us beforehand. Nevertheless, we decided to stay and try out their lunch menu.

The price point seemed reasonable, with most dishes ranging around $20 per plate. We also ordered some tea, which ended up costing us $4 per cup. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to our expectations. Everything seemed to be greasy and overfried, lacking in flavor and quality. It was certainly not worth the price we paid.

To top it off, the service was a bit slow and unattentive. It took a while for our food to come out, and we had to constantly remind them for our orders. By the time our food arrived, we were already quite disappointed. On the bright side, the manager did offer us a complimentary bottle of wine as an apology for the delays.

In the end, we left feeling underwhelmed and dissatisfied. Perhaps this place is better known for their drinks or late-night snacks, but for a lunch spot, it was definitely a letdown. Maybe we'll give it another try for brunch on a Sunday, but based on this experience, we wouldn't recommend it for lunch. "

I was eager to try this place out after hearing so much hype about it. Unfortunately, my excitement turned to disappointment once I actually tasted the food. Don't get me wrong, the salmon burger was decent and moist, but it was nothing special. And for the prices they charge, I was expecting something more than just decent. What really irked me was the portion size - or lack thereof. I could barely find any meat in my sandwich and ended up filling up on french fries instead. My husband and I were both left feeling unsatisfied and even a bit irritated at how little meat there was on our plates. Despite the unique options on the menu, we won't be making a return trip to this establishment. At least we can say we gave it a chance."
1424,"The service was terrible! When I asked for ranch dressing for my calzone as I waited for the calzone to arrive. The waitress grabbed the ranch from my coworkers appetizer and gave it to me.  I guess he didn't want it according to the waitress, cause he was not asked. Then my calzone that I ordered came and it was the wrong calzone. I didn't have time during my lunch break to wait while they cooked another.   When she picked up my other coworkers empty plate of buffalo wings she asked if I wanted the rest of his ranch dressing (streaks of buffalo sauce in it) .  Then at bill time I have her a $20 for a $13.21 lunch and waited for my change. She gave me back only $6- no change, so I included the missing change in the tip amount I left to make a %15 tip even though service was terrible. And got cursed at while leaving.  The food is good but they need to make a serious change in wait staff. If I remembered her name I would have added it to this review."
1425,"I'm trying to figure out how such a great place like Mandalay Bay allows this lousy place to survive? This is not what I envision as part of my mLife experience! \n\nMost items were mediocre, tasteless, too dry, or just frozen food reheated. Desserts? Pitiful.\n\nI will credit a good waitstaff, but the kitchen staff looked bored. I would be too if I had to serve up this slop.\n\nMB management: how about it? Go sample the buffets at Bellagio, Wynn, and Wicked Spoon. Then shut this place and try again."

This was my first time at Lisa G's for dinner and I have to say, I was incredibly disappointed. The same chic decor and friendly waiter greeted us, but unfortunately, that was where the positives ended. We had heard great things about their dinner menu, but I have to say, the prices did not match up with the portions or quality. I ordered the duck confit for $26 and was shocked to see only a small piece of duck on a bed of greens, with a measly side of mashed potatoes. The duck itself was overcooked and dry, and the mashed potatoes tasted like they had been sitting out for hours. My partner ordered the steak special for $32, hoping to get a juicy and flavorful cut of meat. Instead, it arrived overcooked and lacking any real flavor. To top it off, our glasses of wine were completely flat and overpriced. I couldn't believe I had spent over $100 on a meal that had left me feeling unsatisfied and ripped off. I honestly expected more from a place that considers itself a wine bar. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Lisa G's for dinner. Save your money and find a better dining experience elsewhere."
1427,"Recently, I decided to make a roadtrip mini-adventure to Phoenix.  Wow, what a city.  It's beautiful and in the middle of HELL.  Paradise lost, one might say.\n\nI made my reservations to the Rodeway Inn Airport after consulting the internet for a place to stay.  I made a few considerations, such as brand name.  I've been a big fan of Clarion Brand hotels, since I've stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites in a variety of cities over the years.  I concluded my internet reservation the day before and decided this was in a great spot due to airport proximity and brand name.\n\nWhat...a...mistake...\n\nApparently, Phoenix is abnormal compared to many cities I've stayed in.  The airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not.  The hotel chain has a great reputation, but this place was not beautiful. \n\nHere, let me explain!\n\nI arrived at 0500 (5am for y'all) in Phoenix.  My reservation was made, but apparently the Clarion website differs from their policy.  My room was given away since I hadn't checked in by 6am, even though the Clarion website has a Room Guarantee that says they'll hold the room until 7am the next day.  I had a bit of kick back from the onside employee that night.\n\nHotel is rather nasty. It's old.  It's dilapidated.  It was all locked up (more to follow on that).  It was grungy.  Not pleasant, nor reminiscent of the Clarion brand.\n\nRoom was freezing, and appeared sloppily put together.  Curtains were ill fitting, going over the window A/C Heater system and blowing.  Also, the heat didn't work too well, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nBelow the heater though, that's where the magic was found.  A used Trojan Magnum condom and wrapper.  Now THAT'S good times.\n\nApparently, this hotel, this area, this side of the airport is known to locals for the strip clubs, prostitution and drug dealers.  Yup.  It's all that.  \n\nNot gonna be staying here again.  Sorry Clarion.  You've lost me on this one."
1428,"Disappointed. :( \n\nThis has been my favorite car wash. I've been going here for 7 years. No, they do not know me, but the service and quality have been good and consistent. I go out if my way to go here. About 15 miles out if my way, each way. \n\nThe problem? \nFirst... I always got the platinum car wash for $27 (it used to be $25). Today the same services cost me $31. \nSecond... They were severely understaffed. I was informed after going through the wash that they were running behind. It took 44 minutes in total for a services that usually takes about 25 minutes. \n\nIf you are that understaffed let people know before they pay for the service. When you increase your prices by 15% in my case, you are raising the bar. You missed it!!!\n\nSorry... I won't be back. There is a full-service car wash much closer to where I live. It's no longer worth it to go out if my way to use this facility."

The experience at this tattoo shop was truly disappointing. From the moment we walked in, there were warning signs that this would not be a great experience. We were told to bring cash, without any explanation why. And when we arrived, our attempts to communicate were met with confusion, and later, accusations of being drugged. The artist I had specifically requested was not available, and it seems as though they had no intention of honoring my request. My disappointment was only amplified by the rude and unprofessional behavior of the owner, who seemed more interested in defending himself than providing good customer service. It's a shame, because I had such high hopes for this place based on some outdated positive reviews. But it's clear that the quality of their service has gone downhill. I regret that I wasted my time and money at this establishment and will not be returning. I strongly recommend looking elsewhere for a tattoo artist with honesty and integrity."
1430,"The Atrium is interesting as an event space, because if we really look at it, most people would call it like it is - a lobby.  That is good news, since it means you can get to it easily from a number of directions: The parking deck, the building, even the street give you easy access.\n\nUnfortunately, that means if there is a paid event in there, controlling that access can be a challenge for the organizers, and getting into the event may mean that you have to follow a maze - for instance, walking around from the back to the front just to go back through the appropriate entrance.  But it works.\n\nAs to an event space, it is nice, but it does not hold a ton of people.  Once you get beyond a certain size, it really needs to be a larger space.  For your mid-sized events, the space is excellent, but it can fill up quickly and that is when you can run into issues trying to navigate tables, mingle and also see what is going on at the event."

Intention Review: While I myself am not a fan of sushi, I went with my group of friends for a bachelorette party and the other girls all enjoy sushi. I have to say, I was left disappointed, as were my friends. The first thing they all mentioned was how overpriced the food was for the quality. They even said they wouldn't come back to this spot next time they come to Las Vegas. As for me, the options for non-sushi eaters were slim. I could either choose two measly chicken squares or pay a whopping $35 for a steak. Not exactly what I had in mind before a night out at the bars. I ended up settling for the chicken and edamame, which left me unsatisfied and still hungry. Maybe next time I'll bring my own snacks."
1432,"I love magic shops. It reminds me of all the joy and wonder of my childhood. So, when I visited Vegas, I thought I'd bring a little of that home to my six year old. The magician at the counter assured me that my son could pull off the simple, yet impressive boxes of flowers in a bag trick. I was sold and they packaged up our sale. My son was so excited, until he opened the box. They gave us one that had been obviously used, and used a lot! The bag was already ripped in two places. The bottom of the boxes are all falling off, and the plastic is all dinged and scratched on the boxes. What a bummer. A twenty dollar bummer. Not cool. I really wanted to like these guys, but I feel like I got hustled. Had the product been new, I would have given them four stars, but since the whole core of our transaction was the product...1 star."

My experience at Babbo was nothing short of disappointing. I had heard great things about this place, but after trying their food, I can safely say that I will not be going back. We ordered two chicken marinara sandwiches and an order of spaghetti with marinara sauce, but it was clear that the food was not up to par.

First of all, the sandwich was a mess. I had requested some extra marinara sauce on the side, but it was slapped on top of the sandwich, making it too messy to pick up and eat. And let me tell you, the focaccia bread was way too salty. I love salt, but this was excessive. My mouth was burning after the first bite and it didn't get any better from there. The chicken was dry and tasteless, adding to the overall disappointment of the sandwich.

As for the spaghetti, it was bland and needed some serious seasoning. We were shocked to find out that this dish was no longer on the menu at this location. And to make matters worse, there was a ton of food leftover at the end of our meal, and we usually have no complaints when it comes to take-out. But this time, my husband and I both agreed that the food was inedible.

To top it off, I have a heart condition and high blood pressure, so the excessive amount of salt was not only unpleasant but also potentially harmful for my health. I believe that adding salt should be a choice for the customer, not something that is forced upon them. Needless to say, this was our first and last visit to Babbo. And even my typically tolerant husband couldn't finish the leftovers or find any redeeming qualities in the meal.

I wish I could give this place a negative rating because I never want anyone else to experience the disappointment and discomfort that we did. Babbo, you have lost a potential regular customer in me. Until you improve your food and customer service, I will not be returning. "

I was initially drawn to this restaurant by the rave reviews of their food, and I have to say, I was not disappointed. The chips and salsa were absolutely delicious, and the service was top-notch. Our server was attentive and friendly, and our food came out quickly. 

However, my overall dining experience was dampened by the state of the restaurant. As soon as I walked in, I noticed how filthy the walls were. They were covered in soda, salsa, dust, and who knows what else. It was a major turn-off and left me wondering about the cleanliness of the rest of the restaurant. 

It's such a shame because the food and service were so great. But unfortunately, the dirty environment made me decide not to return. I couldn't help but wonder what the kitchen must look like if the front of the house was that dirty. It's such a shame that such delicious food is being served in such an unclean place. 

I really wanted to love this restaurant, but the state of the walls and overall cleanliness just won't allow it. I would recommend the food, but definitely beware of the environment. The chips and salsa may be delish, but I won't be going back."

I visited Ryad with my mom during our stay at Harrahs Hotel, which was conveniently located just downstairs. We were drawn in by the prime real estate location of the kiosk, right in the center at the east entrance by the stairs leading down to the parking lot. And you definitely can't miss it!

Now, although Ryad has a great selection of Moroccan and Middle Eastern pastries, I have to say that the rose-flavored lakoum (Turkish delight) was just okay. My work friend had brought me some from Turkey and let me tell you, the real deal was so much fresher and packed with flavor. Here at Ryad, it's passable but not amazing.

On the upside, they do have an impressive variety of other desserts, including Chinese-inspired treats like dessert pasta and soup. But when it came to the other buffet options, we found them to be lacking in flavor and on the dry side. For the price we paid, we would have expected a bit more taste and texture in our dishes. In comparison, we've had much better experiences at other buffets like Wicked or the one inside Paris.

But I have to give credit where credit is due - the service at Ryad was excellent. The staff were attentive and friendly, and we even walked away with a couple of complimentary cotton candies. Overall, our experience at Ryad was average. While we may come back to try their other pastries, we would probably opt for a different buffet next time."

We stumbled upon this restaurant during our stay in the area and decided to give it a try based on its proximity to our hotel. Unfortunately, our experience fell short of our expectations. The interior was undergoing a renovation, which was not mentioned in any of the previous reviews we had read. This made for a less-than-desirable atmosphere and left us wondering why the owner hadn't provided this important update.

While the owner was friendly, the same cannot be said for the quality of the food. The green chili omelet was mediocre at best, lacking the flavor and warmth we were hoping for. And to make matters worse, the potatoes served on the side were lukewarm. It's frustrating to pay for a breakfast that is not even hot.

One of the main reasons we chose this restaurant was because of its convenience. However, the lackluster food and atmosphere make it unlikely that we will return for breakfast tomorrow. It seems like a shame that it's so difficult to find a good breakfast joint in this area.

Overall, our experience at this restaurant was just ""ok."" This is not a place we would recommend to friends or family visiting from out of state. Perhaps if we had prior knowledge of the renovations and lower expectations, our visit would have been more tolerable. But as it stands, we were disappointed with our experience. "

Overall, not in the same league as the cheese steaks at Jersey Mike's though."
1440,I was excited to see that they were opening a burger place thats less then a 5 minute walk. The first burger I tried here was very disappointing. The burger was way too small for the price.

I had high expectations for this place after reading all the positive reviews on Yelp. My wife and I were in the mood for some flavorful chicken dishes and this place seemed like the perfect spot. We were pleasantly surprised by the cozy atmosphere and the reasonable prices. However, our excitement was short-lived as our food arrived. The chicken dishes were just mediocre, lacking the wow-factor we were hoping for. It was a bit disappointing considering the hype around this place. To make matters worse, the service was slow and we found ourselves constantly having to flag down our server for refills. Overall, we left feeling underwhelmed. Perhaps this place is better for other dishes, but our experience fell short. "

During our recent food adventure, we had the chance to experience an amazing showcase of food and wine at the art museum. While we were blown away by the quality and taste of the dishes, we couldn't shake off a few negatives about the event. For one, the layout was awkward and crowded, making it difficult to navigate. But let's be real, the weather and number of attendees are out of anyone's control. However, it was a bit frustrating to see some parents bringing their young children and strollers to an event like this. It's not the place for that, folks.

Now, onto a few neutral points. Let's just say the beer selection was nothing to write home about. But considering it was a food and wine showcase, it's not surprising. It's no secret that beer hasn't quite made it into the foodie scene in Phoenix yet. And while there were some odd food choices from certain restaurants, it was mostly smooth sailing with delicious dishes being served left and right.

Now, onto the good. The selection of restaurants was impressive, and the wines offered were top-notch. We were also amazed by the fact that these talented chefs were able to serve such high-quality food outside of their own kitchens. The level of skill and taste was truly commendable. Overall, it was a fantastic experience for the senses, despite a few hiccups. We can't wait to see what next year's event has in store."

1444,"Pink Spot is a pretty cool lil place. I was told that it was out in the Vegas area, just off the strip. Making the trek out here was something else!! I didn't think that it would have been such a mission to get here. My GPS signal was lost. That's how far out there it was. Luckily for us, I had mapped it out earlier and had really looked into the detailed directions. This shop, in my opinion, was good and bad. The good thing was that it was nicely decorated and clean. Their signage was easy to read and their various promo info was posted clearly in several places. The flavors here are pretty cool. They are not super cheap juices like at some other places. They have a good variety of flavors. However, and this is one of the thing that bothers me the absolute most, they do not have many of their flavors available for sample. You have to just take their word for it that it's good or bad or that you would or would not like it. I didn't like that part. I thought that they would have a better stash of sample juices for customers who were first time pink spot juice buyers. I also didn't like the girl that was helping us. She was full of attitude and talked to us like we weren't human. WTF!! I know that I had some questions about different products that they had in their cases but she didn't need to give me that look like I was an idiot. And of course, the tone in her voice couldn't been a bit more welcoming. She almost looked annoyed that she had to help us. Too bad she was the one behind the counter that day. I don't like the whole roll your eyes and smack your gum thing at me. I think the other thing that really made me upset was that lots of regulars walked in and were helped before us although we had been waiting a lot longer. Not to mention, once you've \""ordered\"" your juices, you are stuck waiting for them. There are a bunch of ppl in the back room working like oompa loompas. I think that they are dispensing your juices into your bottles and things. Anyway, it takes 'em a while to do that and so, rather than have them readily available, you have to wait for your bottles of juice to be filled. Man that took too long. In the mean time, too, there isn't anything to do. It was fun to visit just to see where this place was but there is NO way that I'd really want to come back. I can just as easily order my juices on line. BOO!!"

I used to have a lot of business meetings with clients at this place (at least twice a week) as it was right down the street from my office.  The food is not great and the service is unusually horrible but they have a big selection for my business clients to choose from as most have different tastes and it is more of a relaxing environment in which most like. One Sunday, 2 friends and I were having lunch at a table for four people.  They sat a stranger with us to have lunch....very awkward, but was okay as we were all drinking beers.  About two weeks later (on a Friday), I was entertaining potential clients discussing our company and answering other questions.  There were three of us sitting at a table for four people.  They had the \""balls\"" to sit another guy at our table as they say they were now sitting groups together to fill all spots.

I ended up at this restaurant by chance while driving on I-60, and I'm glad I did. Despite the long line, the staff greeted us with smiles and friendliness. The restaurant itself has a cozy and charming vibe, making it perfect for a lazy weekend brunch. However, I can't give it a perfect rating due to a few flaws.

First off, the Crab Stuffed Pastry Benedict was a hit and miss. While the hollendaise sauce was rich and delicious, the imitation crab didn't quite hit the mark for me, especially at the price of $12. But, the real disappointment was the side of potatoes, which were lacking in both quantity and taste. I couldn't help but think that the rude cashier would have been better suited manning the kitchen rather than handling customers.

Speaking of the cashier, I have to mention her again. My previous experience with her was extremely unpleasant and this time was no different. It's a shame because the rest of the staff was amazing and really made the dining experience enjoyable. But, the rude cashier and the dirty bathrooms left a bad taste in my mouth.

We also tried the standard Eggs Benedict with a side of fruit, which turned out to be a major disappointment. The sad-looking bowl of fruit only consisted of a few measly pieces of oranges and some tiny slices of honeydew. Definitely not worth the extra cost. However, the poached egg and canadian bacon were cooked to perfection and the english muffin was soft and buttery.

Overall, I would say the food is okay, but nothing to write home about. However, the service and friendly staff are what make this place stand out. I will definitely be giving the omelette a try next time and hopefully, the cashier will have learned some manners by then."

My husband and I stumbled upon Max's Opera Cafe while exploring the area around the Opera House in San Francisco. With two hours to spare before our holiday matinee of the Nutcracker, we decided to grab lunch. And boy, were we glad we did! The restaurant had an amazing energy and was beautifully decorated for the season. However, our excitement quickly faded when we received our meals. While my salmon caesar salad was perfectly cooked and delicious, my husband's dish was underwhelming to say the least. And don't even get me started on the service. Our server seemed to be going through the motions and lacked any real energy or enthusiasm. To make matters worse, the wait for our food was excruciatingly long. We waited longer for our lunch than the entire duration of the show. And to top it all off, the restaurant was not equipped to handle the holiday crowds. The line to get in stretched outside the door, causing chaos and frustration for both customers and staff. It was clear that the restaurant was not adequately prepared for the rush. Though the ambiance was nice, the subpar food and poor service left a sour taste in our mouths. Sadly, our first experience at Max's Opera Cafe was a disappointment and we won't be returning anytime soon. "
1449,"I went in for a polish change.  They were busy and the shift manager was stressed out.  She decided to do the polish change herself.  She rushed through it and did a terrible job.  I've never complained and spoken up when I haven't loved my polish but this was bad.  So with my heart racing I got the nerve up to say something.  She decided to argue about it and defend the polish change.  I told her to never mind but then she insisted on doing it again.  I was embarrassed beyond belief.  Apparently she didn't care that she was arguing with a customer.  \n\nSo here is the redeeming part of my review.  A few minutes after the manager lady left another employee, who apparently saw what happened, came and touch up the polish and was so sweet to me.  She put my sandals on me and walked me up and wrote the ticket and had me pay.  She was ultra kind.  This kind lady is the reason for the three stars.  The manager lady is the reason for the lacking two stars.  \n\nIt's kind of sad because I've been there several times in the past and been satisfied.\n\nBEWARE...don't get just a polish change.  They won't like you."

My first time at this club was an amazing experience. The atmosphere was lively and the music was on point. I would highly recommend getting on the guest list, especially if you have a group of guys with you. We had a blast and it definitely saved us some money on cover charges. 

The club itself is decent in size and the VIP area with the white couches is a nice touch. I even discovered an upstairs area on my second visit, which was a nice escape from the crowded dance floor. 

However, my only issue with this club was the lack of seating. It was difficult to find a place to rest and catch your breath without being approached by bouncers telling us to move. I like to sit on the back of the couches in VIP, but apparently that is not allowed. 

Overall, I would recommend this club as a decent option in Vegas. The cover charges were reasonable and the atmosphere was fun. But, I do believe there are better options out there and I would only choose this club as a last resort. "

I recently visited this REI location for the first time and I was extremely disappointed with the overall experience. As an avid outdoor enthusiast, I have had high expectations for REI based on my previous experiences at other locations. However, my visit to this particular store left me feeling frustrated and unimpressed. 

First of all, let's talk about the layout of the store. While it may have been convenient for me to navigate, it was definitely lacking in creativity and variety. It seemed like a carbon copy of every other REI I've been to, which was quite boring to say the least. 

But what really pushed me over the edge was the customer service. While I understand that not all employees can be experts, I was appalled by the lack of knowledge and helpfulness of some of the staff. I encountered a few individuals who seemed more interested in chatting with their co-workers than assisting customers who were actually interested in making a purchase. 

My disappointment only worsened when I tried to call the store to inquire about a product. After being put on hold for what felt like an eternity, I was transferred to the automated phone service and was never able to speak to a real person. It's safe to say that this experience has completely turned me off to REI for good. 

I believe in supporting local and independent businesses, but this REI location has shown me the importance of investing in high-quality equipment and knowledgeable customer service. Although the prices may be a bit higher, it's worth it for the peace of mind and assurance of receiving excellent service. Don't waste your time at this REI, there are plenty of other outdoor retailers out there that will exceed your expectations."

I have to say, I am extremely disappointed with the service at this jewelry store. My wife's bracelet needed some repair and a good cleaning, so I brought it here based on some good reviews. However, the experience was far from satisfactory.

First of all, I was told the bracelet would be ready on Monday, so I made plans to pick it up then. But when Monday passed and I still didn't hear back from the store, I called on Wednesday and was told it would now be ready on Friday. Frustrated but still hopeful, I made the trip on Saturday to retrieve the bracelet. And what a letdown it was.

Not only was the previously requested repair not done properly, but the bracelet's finish was completely ruined. It had lost its shine and turned an unappealing color. And to make matters worse, the clasp was now broken on the other side as well. I couldn't believe it. Did the store not have any pride in their work?

I took the damaged bracelet home, not wanting to risk any further damage from the store. But it wasn't long until my wife noticed the damage and the clasp broke completely. It was clear that the store's carelessness had caused this second break. And to top it off, the employee had knowingly given back the damaged bracelet to me with no regard for the sentiment it held.

I am extremely disappointed in the lack of professionalism and respect at this store. While I can replace the physical bracelet, the sentimental value can never be replaced. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will be taking my business elsewhere in the future."

I recently visited this place after hearing rave reviews, but I was left a bit disappointed. While the pricing and variety of food options were a plus, the overall experience was just average. The Tangy BBQ sauce didn't quite hit the mark for me, and the corn on the cob lacked that desired crispness and sweetness. I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the hype. Maybe it was an off day, but I wasn't blown away by the food. And the atmosphere didn't do much to enhance the dining experience either. I prefer a cozy and inviting ambiance, but the food court setup just didn't work for me. Plus, the ventilation was poor and the lack of a non-smoking area was a major downside. Overall, my experience at this restaurant was underwhelming. While the food was just okay, I was hoping for a bit more in terms of atmosphere and overall experience. Perhaps I'll give it another chance in the future, but for now, I can't say I would highly recommend this place."
1454,"We really gave this place a chance but it just failed in so many ways. \n\nFirst off, I don't know if the guy in charge of house sound is deaf or what but the music was so loud that we were straining our voices trying to talk (yell) to each other. Then the Canadiens game began and it was even louder. For a place trying to serve fancy looking food, the ambiance just sucked because of the noise. It was not a busy night, so I'm not sure why they thought they had to deafen their patrons.\n\nThe menu was simple enough but unfortunately so was the waitress. This waitress was just not all there.  She was pleasant, easy on the eyes but that's about it. She took our drink orders, upsold us to the larger portion of salmon tartar and forgot to take our dinner order.\n \nWhen she came back with the drinks 10 minutes later, she spun on her heels to go do something else and we had to almost grab her to get her to take our orders. We ordered the flank (bavette) steak and she seemed to forget to ask how we would like it cooked. My dinner companion took matters into his own hands and actually chased the waitress down across the restaurant to make SURE she knew to put the order in for medium rare. 20 minutes passed, 30 minutes passed. No tartar, no flank steaks.\n\nThen out came the tartar appetizer at the same time as the steaks... The tartar wasn't particularly inspired, little flavour and served with 6 french fries. We dug into the steaks and, wouldn't you know it, they were well done to the point of being the tenderness of shoe leather and as dry as tree bark. 1-2 bites in we cut the middle of the steaks to see if there was any hopeful hint of pink, but no dice. The waitress didn't ask the basic  question of \""is everything ok?\"" as we began our meal so we tried to flag down the guy in the dress shirt who seemed to be a manager. He didn't see us (or anyone else for that matter) as he just sat down on the bar and fiddled with his iPhone. \n\nWe finally managed to get a manager and by that time it was too much for us. It was a very unfortunate experience but at least the manager was kind enough to delete the shoe steaks from the bill. As we headed for the door I doubt our waitress had any idea what had transpired. She was cheerful and looked as if she was pleased to see satisfied customers leaving. Alas, that was clearly not not the case -  Factory was a total failure right from front of house to back.\n\nWe left hungry and disappointed, so we went up the street to La Belle Provence to get hot dogs and poutine instead. At least there, they knew what they're doing."

After patiently waiting in line for 45 minutes, my anticipation for the highly praised smoked meat sandwich grew. Finally, when we received our order, we were disappointed to see the overly stuffed meat slices barely held together by the rye bread. This level of disappointment continued as we took a bite of the sandwich, only to find ourselves underwhelmed by the lack of flavor. As we looked around, we couldn't help but notice the seemingly sufficient amount of staff working behind the counter. Yet, despite the high number of employees, the orders were taking forever to come out. Frankly, it was a let down to see such a hyped up place fail to live up to expectations. Sorry, but this deli did not leave us feeling satisfied."
1456,"My wife and I were invited to the pre-grand opening thing here last night.  It was pretty much like I expected; free food, pretty busy, etc., etc.\n\nThe actual location is very nice, very new and very clean so no complaints there.  Their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast, friendly and helpful.\n\nI didn't really know what to make of this place.  Is it fast food?  Is it a nice, sit-down type of place?  I think it is a small, more \""upscale\"", \""boutiquey\"" Fudruckers.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  Just saying that is what I thought of the place.  \n\nAnyway, about the food:\n\n* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.\n\n* Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.\n\n* Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.\n\nI know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.\n\nI really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.\n\nAnyway, my first Smashburger experience was a pleasant one and I would like to return to get another burger, try their regular fries, get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle."

My husband and I were visiting SoHo for the first time and decided to try out Bucca di Beppo. We were excited to try their famous Caprese Salad and Penne San Remo, but unfortunately, our experience fell short of our expectations. 
The Caprese Salad lacked the freshness and flavor we were hoping for - the tomatoes were bland and the mozzarella was rubbery. And don't even get me started on the Penne San Remo. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce tasted like it came from a jar. Definitely not worth the price we paid. 
We've had much better Italian food in our hometown of Phoenix, so we were disappointed that we didn't get the same quality here. Honestly, you can find better Italian food at a fraction of the price at other restaurants in the city. Save your money and go elsewhere for a more satisfying meal."

I also helped myself to their pickled Carrot and Serrano peppers (mmmm Spicy.. though I prefer the grilled peppers from Senor taco) \n\nFood: I chose to order the more adventurous Tripe, head and Shrimp tacos. \nTripe: Rather gamey and had a smell like the cow was having a bad day when it got chosen to be eaten\nHead: Interesting taste and smell (tasted a lot like a slightly off Carne asada). I was expecting portions of brain as well (but maybe after Bovine Spongi..what not,  its probably safer that I didn't)\nShrimp: Bit overdone (hence rubbery) but with a good griil aroma and flavor.\n\nAuthenticity: Definitely \n\nNet Impression: Will go here again and order the more traditional fare. I'm leaning towards the mole to make my final decision. As always Mom and Pop authentic stores always has a soft corner for me."

Sambalatte is a great spot for your caffeine fix in Las Vegas. The location is what really makes it stand out - situated in a plaza where you can also grab a bottle of wine or do some shopping while sipping on your coffee. It's a refreshing change from the overabundance of Starbucks in the city. The two-story layout provides ample seating options, both inside and out. 
I ordered an iced caramel latte to combat the scorching Las Vegas heat and it hit the spot. But the real star of the show for me was the macarons. Whether they are made in-house or not, these little treats were absolutely delicious and the perfect accompaniment to my beverage. 
My only issue with Sambalatte was the service. While the drinks and macarons were top notch, the staff seemed a bit unengaged and uninterested. It was a minor inconvenience, but it did take away from the overall experience. Nonetheless, I will still be returning for my caffeine and macaron fix."

I was really disappointed with my experience at this nail salon. I had heard great things about the owner and had high hopes for the quality of service. However, when I brought my girlfriend in to get her nails redone by the owner, we were met with rudeness and disrespect. Not only did he refuse to redo her nails or offer a refund, but he also insulted her and called her a ""cheap girl"" just because she had left a previous review on Yelp.

The owner's behavior was completely unprofessional and left us feeling disrespected and disappointed. On top of that, the products and services were subpar. The nail polish colors on display were not the same as the ones that actually showed up on our nails, and the overall quality was cheap.

It's a shame that such a terrible business owner is running this establishment. All customers deserve to be treated with respect and have their concerns addressed. I would not recommend this place to anyone and hope that the owner learns to take responsibility for their actions and treat their customers better."

My husband and I were excited to visit Roy's after being away from our favorite restaurant for so long. We had always had great experiences here, especially for special occasions. However, on this recent visit, we were extremely disappointed. The food was still good, with my wife raving about her salmon dish and my ono being decent, although a bit overcooked. But the service...oh my, the service was a complete disaster. We arrived to no warm welcomes or greetings, which is unusual for Roy's. The real kicker came when we were seated outside and a group of loud, rowdy people joined us, straight from the pool no less. It turned our fine dining experience into a pub atmosphere. To make matters worse, the wait staff disappeared, leaving our dirty plates on the table for what felt like an eternity. This was a far cry from the Roy's we remembered. We had to speak to the manager to get moved inside so we could have a peaceful dessert and coffee. While the food was still good, the poor service and disruptive outdoor seating area really put a damper on our evening. We may have to think twice before returning."
1462,"I'm thinking more of a 3.5 for this place. Let's start with a negative, the parking is usually a nightmare. The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night. I actually tried eating here this past Friday but we couldn't find a parking spot anywhere, so we left.\n\nLuckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go."

I was so incredibly disappointed with my experience at Rose Tea Cafe. After hearing great things about the authenticity of this place, I couldn't wait to try it for myself. But boy, was I wrong. 
My meal was just a big bowl of salt, and that's saying something coming from someone who loves salty food. The greasiness made me feel sick, and don't even get me started on the bubble tea. It was so sugary that it gave me a headache and I never thought I would say this, but it was too sweet for me. 
I seriously question the quality of their ingredients and their cooking methods. My stomach was not happy after leaving here. Even worse, I paid for this miserable experience. 
Save yourself the trouble and skip this place. Trust me, your taste buds and wallet will thank you."

I was excited to try this place after hearing good things from friends and seeing positive reviews on Yelp. However, my experience was far from what I had expected. On a Saturday night, the place was surprisingly empty and the interior lacked the charm that I had seen in photos. But I was willing to overlook that as long as the food and service were up to par.

We started off with cocktails which were enjoyable, but the real disappointment came with the food. Our server took forever to come back after serving us our appetizers, and by the time we were ready to order, I had watched him visit every table around us multiple times. It seemed like our drinks were forgotten about as well, as we had to flag our server down for refills with empty glasses.

The food itself was decent, but nothing to write home about. My friend's lasagna tasted suspiciously like a Wendy's cheeseburger, and my chicken dish was lacking any traces of the promised marscapone and prosciutto. Instead, it was drowned in a mushroom sauce that tasted like it came straight out of a can. To top it off, the side of pasta with marinara seemed like an odd pairing with a dish that already had a sauce on it.

At this point, I just wanted to fill up on bread and get out of there. But even that was a challenge, as our server took away the bread basket after I had only eaten one piece. And of course, since we had used a gift certificate from Restaurant.com, gratuity was automatically added on top of our underwhelming meal.

I couldn't help but question how this place had such high ratings. Was it just an off night or did my ex end up in the kitchen as a chef? Either way, it was a huge letdown and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."

I have been going to this doctor for years and used to have a great experience. However, lately I have been disappointed. The PA who used to examine my moles on an annual basis has left, and the new one seems overwhelmed. It took months to get an appointment and then I waited an additional 55 minutes in the outer office before finally being seen for my 5 minute examination. I can't help but wonder how much my insurance was charged for such a short visit. It's a shame because I used to trust this doctor and their staff. I may have to start looking for a new dermatologist."
1466,"Tasted great -- felt like I have been in some Washington forest gnawing on pine cones, trying to survive... that's exactly what their Suit-and-tie IPA tasted like: sappy, thick, piney... I can still taste the needles on my tongue. The Weisse beer was sour. I am not quite sure where they went wrong there, or if their red sour keg had an illicit relationship with weisse, but the two tasted exactly the same: nose-wrinkling tooth-hurting sour. We had four people in the group, and I am the only person who likes sour, so I was a trooper and drank everyone's Weisse as well as my Red Sour. The Stout was, well, a Stout, albeit weak. The IPA was pine-needly as well. If you don't mind scraping sap off your gums, picking needles out of your teeth, and drinking squirrel vomit, you will LOVE it!! Honestly the only reason we went there was because the brewery was lauded as the best brewery in the U.S.!! I say, the worst!! Unless you are a squirrel -- then you will love it!! :-)  One star for beer, and two for atmosphere - atmosphere was great, and if the brews were phenomenal, they would get 5 stars from me. Have not tried their food, so that was not included in my review."

The crew at this painting company definitely has a creative flair and a keen eye for detail. I recently had some faux painting done and was impressed by their meticulous work. Each wall was painted with precision, especially since it was a contrast to the base tan color. I appreciate the attention to detail as any slip-up would have been highly noticeable. Overall, I was happy with the finished product. However, the wait time for an available appointment was quite long. It's understandable that they may be busy, but it would have been helpful to know the estimated wait time beforehand. The open-seating policy for booths in the bar area also caused some frustration for my family and a few others who were waiting for nearly an hour while others were able to easily walk in and occupy those booths without a wait. This policy should be regulated to just the bar and high-top tables. Despite these inconveniences, the quality of the work is worth giving them a try.

I had high hopes for this place, especially since it was my second time visiting. Unfortunately, I was disappointed once again. The portion sizes were generous, but the quality of the food was just average. As someone who loves Mexican cuisine, I was hoping for more than just a quick, mass-produced meal. The service was satisfactory and the wait time for our food was reasonable. However, this restaurant didn't leave much of an impression on me. In fact, I think I'll be skipping it next time I'm in the area. It's a shame, because the location and ambiance are quite charming. But in the end, it's the taste of the food that really matters. And this place just didn't deliver. Additionally, I was really hoping to indulge in some delicious pie, as it's a staple item in most diners. Unfortunately, there was no homemade pie in sight. As someone who appreciates a good homemade pie, it was disappointing to not see any on the menu. Overall, this is not the kind of place I would make a special trip for. It's more of a ""good enough"" option when you're already in the area and just need a quick bite to eat. "

Dear Rockhouse Bar,

I want to start off by saying that I had high hopes for this place during my birthday weekend. Unfortunately, those hopes were quickly dashed by some major flaws.

First of all, the drinks were huge and kept me buzzed or blacked out all day...every day. While this might sound great, the quality of the drinks was seriously lacking. They tasted watered down and lacked any real flavor.

But the real disappointment came with the service and atmosphere. The staff seemed more interested in blowing their annoying whistles every time they sold something, than actually providing good service. It was loud and distracting, making it difficult to enjoy the already subpar drinks.

I will say that the location is nice and convenient, especially being near the mall and pool. But that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place.

Overall, I was disappointed with the experience at Rockhouse Bar. I really wanted to have a fun and memorable birthday weekend, and unfortunately, this place did not contribute to that. Sorry, Rockhouse Bar, but you need to step up your game if you want to keep customers coming back. "

I have stayed at many hotels, but my experience at Sunset Station left much to be desired. While the rooms were spacious and the separate sink and shower/toilet areas were a nice touch, there were several negative aspects that detracted from my overall experience.

Firstly, the shower was not up to par. I understand the need to conserve water, but the showerhead was set too low in the wall, making it difficult to take a proper shower. Additionally, the toilet sounded like it was about to suck me in every time I flushed. Not exactly a pleasant experience.

The biggest issue, however, was the lighting in the room. When I first entered, I turned on the light switches next to the door, expecting to light up the entire room. Instead, I was met with darkness and had to scrounge around to find the various lamps and switches scattered throughout the room. It would have been much more convenient to have a light switch by the entrance to the bedroom or for the lamp by the window to be connected to the main light switch.

Overall, while the facility itself was nice and offered great amenities like the bowling alley and oyster bar, the negatives outweighed the positives. I will definitely be looking elsewhere for my next stay in the area. "
1473,"for everyone who says this place is amazing, they must be blind to true culinary technique.  ok so first thing I noticed was the drab wait staff.  very boring and didn't even sound excited to be at work.  on another note, the menu is written well but the food did not deliver.  i wanted to try the fried deviled eggs, and they were clearly warmed up in the microwave and dry. the homemade spicy aioli, was nothing more than sriracha and mayo.  i understand what aioli, but is wasn't mixed well or something. then, i noticed how sloppy everything was plated. no attention to detail!  the knife cuts were terrible and sloppy.  definitely can tell there is not a true chef in the kitchen, rather some cooks.\n\nthe shepherds pie was a farce, (don't expect to get full)  lets not get ahead of our self, it was beef stew with a stack of mashed potatoes on top.  also, the shrimp and sausage and grits, again, was tomatoes and shrimp with a side ot butter and heavy cream added to grits.  \n\nthe bacon smore dessert was plated terribly, looked messy, and unappetizing... keep in mind, it sounded delicious... but at the end of the day, the food was either cold and reheated, burnt from being reheated, or taken out of the freezer and sloppily plated. you can tell nothing is truly made to order.\n\ndo not take a date her to impress them.  that is all\n\nps. im getting some rather insulting comments, let's keep it professional, this is my opinion. nothing else."
1474,"So so disappointed in this place. Please be wary of the integrity of the employees and the owner. Here's the story... I've been to this place a few times before and the food has always been very good. I placed a takeout order a few weeks back and requested no Serrano peppers on BBQ wrap. When I got home we discovered finely chopped serranos in the wrap which resulted in my wife being unable to eat the wrap due to the heat of the peppers. I called and let the restaurant know of the mess up. The employee was very nice and apologized and assured me she would write my name down for a free wrap to make up for the mistake. I went in today to take advantage of my free wrap. I ordered, told the employee that I had a free wrap, she smiled said ok and took my order. As I'm waiting the owner comes and introduces himself. I'm thinking he's come to find out what happened and I'm thinking to myself this is good customer service! Come to find out he lets me known whoever I spoke with didn't write my name down in \""the book\"" and unless I can show some proof of who I spoke with he would not honor my free wrap. He then proceeded to question my motivation and ask if I had some proof of my visit three weeks ago... Without proof no free sand.... Point of this whole story is this is a horrible way to treat a customer much less a customer whose order you screwed up on.. Not only do you screw up but then you accuse me of lying about it... And this is coming from the owner of the establishment! I hope it was worth it you've lost a customer for life and I will make sure my office NEVER orders lunch from your establishment ! Everyone else reading this should boycott a place that no respect for the customers that make their business."

The first red flag I noticed at this restaurant was the smell. It reminded me of a greasy old restaurant, with that familiar dirty carpeting smell. The decor was a bit outdated, but I was willing to overlook that if the food and service were good. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed on both fronts.

Let's start with the food. I ordered the $12.95 spaghetti and was shocked at the portion size. It was hardly worth the price. The tomato sauce was decent, but it was almost too sweet for my taste. And while the menu described the garlic as a prominent ingredient, I could barely taste it. To make matters worse, my baked lasagna was served at a lukewarm temperature.

But the real disappointment was the service. When we first arrived, the restaurant was not busy at all. Yet, it still took a while for our server to come over and take our order. And once the restaurant filled up, it seemed like the staff completely forgot about us. We were left waiting for our drinks to be refilled and had to flag down a server just to get our check.

I really wanted to support this independent restaurant, but unfortunately, I found myself thinking ""next time, I'll just go to the Olive Garden"". It's a shame because I prefer non-chain establishments, but I simply cannot overlook the lackluster experience at this place. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for good food and service."

I had high expectations for this restaurant, but unfortunately, it fell a bit short for me. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something was missing in the flavors of the Malaysian dishes. Perhaps it's just not my preferred cuisine, as I'm not a huge fan of spicy food and I have a shrimp allergy. However, I will say that the curry puffs were quite tasty, though a bit too spicy for my liking. I also ordered the basil noodles and the captain's noodles, both of which had great potential but fell a bit flat in taste and lacked the kick I was hoping for. On the bright side, the roti was perfectly crispy and the lychee drink was absolutely delicious. I can't complain about the service either, as it was top-notch and made the dining experience enjoyable. 

My only major complaint about this place was the seating arrangement. We were squeezed into a table for two that should really be designated as a table for one. It was way too small for our two plates, drinks, and any additional items we needed on the table. It's definitely a minor inconvenience, but it did take away from the overall dining experience. 

Despite my mixed feelings, I would still recommend giving this place a try. The atmosphere is charming and well-decorated, and the service is exceptional. Plus, I'm sure the dishes would be a hit for anyone who loves Malaysian cuisine or has no dietary restrictions. And if you do decide to check it out, don't forget to stop by the gelato shop just two doors down. Trust me, it's the perfect way to end your meal on a sweet note. "

My experience with this establishment was beyond disappointing. After being repeatedly told by \""Mike\"" that I was wrong about unauthorized charges on my account, I was hung up on. Not only was my money wasted, but now they wanted to charge me even more for their mistake. In hopes of warning others about their terrible customer service, I took to their Facebook page only to have my post deleted and be blocked from reposting. It's clear that they don't care about their customers or their reputation. I even reached out via email but have yet to receive a response. It's no wonder they have a growing number of complaints and a dwindling amount of customers. And don't even get me started on their long wait times, hidden fees, and constantly crashing website. Needless to say, I will never be returning and urge others to avoid this place at all costs. One star is too generous for this place, but unfortunately ""no stars"" isn't an option."
1478,"I recently went for a sold-out concert and my chief complaint seems to be the same as everyone else's - not nearly, no how, no way on this earth, are there enough restrooms here. I missed several songs because I went during intermission between two bands and there still wasn't enough time to get in & out of the restroom. The lines were ridiculous. They're also far away from the concert itself. My suggestion would be to stack port-a-johns up at the back of the grassy area. They make a lot of money off of selling alcoholic beverages and one well-known side effect is the classic \""breaking of the seal\"". Unless you want people to stop drinking and stop spending their money - get more bathrooms!! \n\nThey don't charge for parking which is great. Cell phone service doesn't exist once the shows have started. If you're attempting to call or text to meet up with friends - it's not happening. Make your plans and designate a rendezvouz location prior to the show starting. Get there early or you'll have to park far away & traffic will take forever to get you in."

My experience at Jobing.com Arena was truly disappointing. I had high hopes for this venue after hearing rave reviews from friends and family, but my first visit left me feeling underwhelmed and frustrated. The staff may have been courteous and nice on the surface, but their actions told a different story. I couldn't help but notice the outdated scoreboard while watching the game, and the lack of urgency from the employees when it came to customer requests was alarming. I couldn't believe it when I saw other guests walking out with ""to-go"" cups, yet when I asked for one myself, I was flatly denied. And don't even get me started on the Hooters food that was being served. The waitresses were nowhere near the level of service I'm used to at other locations. And while the fountains and shops outside the arena were a nice touch, it was not enough to make up for the long drive to get there and the frustrating traffic. Overall, I will not be returning to Jobing.com Arena in the future. I'll be taking my business elsewhere, where the customer is actually valued."
1480,"There really isn't the need to go to a pretentious and rather obnoxious restaurant to get such a small amount of so-so food for a disproportional amount of money with inconsiderate service to boot.  \n\nFurthermore, serving potatoes and white bread, it is clear that this restaurant has no knowledge of what constitutes a healthy meal.  (If you don't either then you might consult the book, \""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School guide to healthy eating.\"")\n\nThe service started out bad and got worse.  When we arrived only 1 of the 8 or so tables for two was occupied, and the attempted to seat us right next to the other occupied table so that we'd have to listen to the other couple and vice-versa.  We refused that table and opted for one a few yards away, only to find that the person seated in the aisle-most seat constantly gets bumped by waiters coming back and forth to the tables in the front section.  The server could have warned us about this and seated us at another of the many empty tables for two, but she failed to do so.   When we left there was still only one other couple in the two-seater section, there really was no excuse for being placed at a table where you get repeatedly jossled by cross-traffic, nor was there any excuse for having the aisle so narrow near a table.\n\nI became truly angry at this restaurant when the food arrived.  I got the Salmon, and there WASN'T MUCH OF IT THERE.  The waiter arrived to ask how the first few bites were, and I almost told him that actually there were only three bites there.  It was supposed to come with some other vegetable-type stuff, and there was also very little of that.  The salmon wasn't cooked that well, certainly the stuff I make at home is better.  \n\nThe infuriating service will spoil the mood, this is not the place for any sort of social occasion."
1481,"We had heard that after the change of ownership that this improved greatly. We never tried it before, but thought we would give it a shot. We tried the continental breakfast and the mushroom spinach quiche. We were disappointed in both. The continental breakfast comes with a croissant that was too doughy and the crepe omelet was mediocre.  The quiche had good flavor, but was the dough was still raw which spoiled the taste. Hopefully, they get their act together over time because it is a very cute place with a lot of potential."
1482,"

We were pretty disappointed with our experience at this restaurant. Despite the wide variety of menu options, the food was underwhelming and the service left much to be desired. Our waitress seemed to be in a rush, barely acknowledging us and making us wait for our drinks and order to be taken. And while the wait for our food was quite long, it wasn't worth the wait. My omelet was mostly egg and spinach, with barely any mushrooms or ham as advertised. And the Emperor's Won-Ton soup, while full of ingredients, lacked any real flavor. We couldn't help but compare it to the amazing food we had tasted in the Asian restaurants in SG, so it was definitely a disappointment. The price was decent, but that also seemed to reflect the poor quality of both the food and service. Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but we won't be rushing back anytime soon."
1483,Found this place on packer-bars.com. Tara-bull!  Some what rude service. If I ever go back it will be because I'm feeling antisocial and want to be left alone. Perhaps I wasn't welcome or some one was having a bad day but this post did get a rather nasty reply accusing me of lying. The place was dead for an un-televised game and I can totally understand why. Although it could be the lady who has a very high pitched scream when there is a good play or even extra point. ;)

My husband and I were thrilled to spend our 1 year wedding anniversary at this fancy hotel. The rooms were truly spectacular, with breathtaking views. We were greeted with delicious chocolate-covered strawberries, a lovely touch to start our celebration. The pool was also a highlight, with refreshing drinks and a relaxed atmosphere. Unlike other dayclubs, I didn't feel like I was in a bikini contest. It was the perfect place to unwind and soak up the sun. The complimentary frozen treats were a pleasant surprise, I especially enjoyed the frozen grapes and lemonade slushie.

The gym was well-equipped and provided complimentary earphones, making my workout even more enjoyable. I appreciated the convenience of having towels and water bottles at each machine. Plus, the added bonus of grabbing a fresh fruit on my way out. However, I have to deduct a star for the hassle of having to take two different elevators every time we left or returned to the hotel. It would have been much more convenient to have just one.

Be warned, if you do decide to stay here, don't expect any comps or acknowledgment of any issues. We were met with indifference when we encountered some mishaps during our stay. Our experience was not taken seriously and our valuables were not safe. Even a simple request for a haircut for my 2-year-old ended in disaster. Overall, this hotel may seem fancy, but don't be fooled by its facade. Keep your valuables at home, take care of any grooming needs elsewhere, and pack your own survival food if you want to avoid mediocre service and any potential trouble. Definitely not worth the headache."
1485,"I like how its cheap, but does it really need to look cheap? It's as though they decided oh let's take over San Remo and add some cheap things to make it appear as if they are staying at a beach house in Vegas. They glued some wood to the wall for the headboard and cut(not a clean cut either) an uneven rectangle for the outlet. The signs that most hotels use to advertise conserving water has a nice approach but this sign says \""Do you really need clean sheets/towels?\"" whoa...of course I do. Are you telling me that if that previous customer didn't touch that towel and left it folded, that you will leave that in there? Scary thought. Clean sheets is a must! Doesn't help that they had a burned cigarette hole in the comforter in a non-smoking room. But of course what do you expect from a room that was about $75 on a Saturday night during Halloween. Glad I only stayed there for one night"
1486," Overall, it was a decent spot for a casual night out.

I stopped by this place with some friends for drinks on a weekend night. It was recommended by someone else and I was curious to check it out. The atmosphere was pretty laid back and relaxed, perfect for a casual night out with friends. We started off at the bar and the drinks were decent, but nothing too exceptional. We ended up moving to a table and while we didn't play pool as originally planned, we still had a good time catching up and chatting. The food was nothing special, just your average bar food, but it did the job. Prices were on par with similar places in the area, so no real complaints there. Overall, it was a decent spot for a chilled out night with friends, but nothing to rave about."
1487,"YELP REVIEW UPDATE\n\nI AM UBER BUMMED, but my review below was for the CHEYENNE location, not this Rainbow location. Apparently the CHEYENNE location went out of business. The last time I was there, the managers told me they were opening a second location (Rainbow).\n\nIt's all good though, because you can get the original Bobbie from Capriottis just down the street on Cheyenne and Buffalo. It's no knockoff like the Robert.\n\nAlso, beware of false advertising. These guys claim LV Weekly gave them the award for \""Best Sandwich in Las Vegas\"" in 2010 and 2011. Not entirely true. In 2010, they were tied with Capriotti's. And in 2011, the best sandwich went to The Johnny at Johnny McGuire's. Google it for yourself. \n\nDon't buy into false advertising. This place off Cheyenne was damn good. But don't let lies deceive you.\n\nIn any case, any Yelp reviews you see, might be from the old location at Cheyenne. Not a knock on Eddie D's because I used to love this place. I just don't want my review of the Cheyenne location to transfer over to the Rainbow location. It's not fair."
1488,"

I had high hopes for this restaurant after hearing great things about their cheese curds, but unfortunately I was left disappointed. While the cheese curds themselves were tasty, there was just way too much breading for my liking. I could barely taste the cheese! Talk about a letdown.

But my disappointment didn't end there. The portobello sandwich, while it had potential, was marinated in what seemed like an excessive amount of salt. And the mozzarella on top was so dry and bland that even if it wasn't overpowered by the salt, I doubt I would have been able to taste it anyway.

The chicken salad sandwich was another miss. The filling was minimal and the bread, although toasted nicely, was drenched in butter. I didn't even finish half of it because it was just too greasy for my taste. And my friend's Rubin was so tough and hard to eat that she gave up on it altogether. Even our fourth friend was unimpressed with his BBQ pork sandwich, saying it was good but not worth a return visit.

On the bright side, the sweet potato fries were a saving grace. They were perfectly crispy and well-seasoned, a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing dining experience. And to top it off, our water glasses were never refilled despite our attempts to get the waiter's attention.

Overall, I hate to say it but this place was a thumbs down for all of us. Maybe next time we'll stick to just getting some fries and call it a day."
1489,"For a restaurant that does not serve extras with their burger, that is to say that fries do not come with your burger, you would think that they would make it up in service and presentation, but no they don't. The service is marginal. They have young, inexperienced waiters and waitresses who do not know the menu and are unable to make recommendations. Their presentation is weak. I've been there twice - once for a burger the other for a salad. The burger was nothing special and the chopped ahi, avocado, and cashew salad was oily, had 1 slice of avocado, and literally 3 cashews hidden in the salad. They are only receiving 1 star because the beer was very cold and well poured. \n\nIf you want a burger which should ALWAYS include fries, go somewhere else. Fries are extra and they try to make them special but without success. If you want a cold beer while your significant other is shopping at the Biltmore, stop in and take a load off. If you want a meal, go somewhere else."

This theatre has a unique and spacious layout with a circular seating arrangement that allows for an unobstructed view of the stage from any seat. The abundance of parking and efficient staff make it easy to enter and exit the theatre without any hassle. I always have a great time here, whether it's for a concert or a play. However, I have to admit, the sound quality and acoustics could use some improvement. The music and dialogue can sometimes be hard to hear clearly. But despite that, it's still a fantastic venue to see a show. I highly recommend it for a night out with friends or a date night. Just be prepared to pay a little extra for the tickets and don't forget to grab a drink at the nearby bar beforehand - everything tastes better after a few drinks, right? Overall, a solid choice for entertainment, but don't expect a top-notch audio experience."
1491,"I wanted Cork to be amazing but it was just alright.\n\nThere used to be a restaurant my wife and I would go to in Las Vegas that was our favorite restaurant in the world.  It was far off The Strip in a little strip mall, they served great food, and had perfect service.  Cork's menu and photos were as close as I have found to that restaurant in Vegas.\n\nI don't have any real complaints about Cork, the food was good and the service was good, it just didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would - which is strange to me because I had Gazelle for dinner that night and I love restaurants that have interesting ingredients on the menu!  Maybe I'm being too hard on Cork - maybe it wasn't my restaurant from Las Vegas like I had hoped and I had unrealistic expectations.\n\nSo, keeping the first part in mind, let's start over.\n\nMy wife and I had been excited to visit Cork ever since we moved back to Arizona in 2012.  The menu looked amazing and (unfortunately for me) there was a menu item on the previous seasons menu that was Elk Strip Loin cooked in Duck Fat.  Those are two of my favorite things brought together in what sounds like one incredible dish.  I wish I had had the chance to try it, but it was off the menu by the time we visited.\n\nWhen I called ahead to let the restaurant know that we were running a few minutes late they said it would not be an issue and were very accommodating.  When we arrived, we were taken to our table right away.\n\nAs I mentioned already, I had gazelle for my entr\u00e9e but it was a tossup between that or the Wild Boar Stew.  I ended up choosing the gazelle in the end mostly because the boar was a stew and I wanted something more substantial than that.  My wife had a steak and she was a little disappointed in it; she said it was just a steak and not very special.\n\nAs I was browsing Cork's menu while writing this review (a few months after having visited), I can definitely see what I would order if I were sitting in their dining room right now.  They have a rabbit risotto for appetizer and a mustard crusted wild boar entr\u00e9e.  This time, I wouldn't consider anything but the boar!\n\nI'm still not certain what it is that makes me so hesitant to return to Cork.  Perhaps it's the price?  Cork is not an inexpensive restaurant and, for the cost, maybe I'm leery of going back.  I would go back - Cork is definitely not a restaurant I would avoid, but I guess I'm not anxious to go back... but looking at their menu does make me want to go back.  I'm conflicted about Cork."
1492,"So I decided to try Tea Station today since I was at Cafe Noodle to get some take out.  I had read some of the reviews here at yelp and figured it should to pretty good.  I was disappointed with the place.  First thing was that they don't use fresh fruit in their drinks.  I ordered a honeydew melon snow ice with boba for my hubby and a rose milk tea with boba for me.  Both were mediums.  The boba were good, but I felt for almost 5 dollars for a medium they could use real fruit instead of powder.  Second the service was not very good.  Well, actually the service was good for me but I think not that good for a couple of Caucasian ladies that walked in after me.  The waitress got very impatient with them because they wanted to know if they used real fruit or not and so just kept talking about how annoying they were in Chinese.  I felt that their question was a legitimate question and she should not have started talking about them even if they didn't understand.  \nI will definitely be sticking to Ay Chung or the place in the China Town mall because they both use real fruit for their drinks."

This restaurant used to be a decent choice when it first opened, but now it is a complete disappointment. Upon entering, I was greeted by dirty floors that looked like they hadn't been cleaned in weeks. And the bathroom was a whole other story - there was feces on the toilet seat and the floor was covered in grime. It was absolutely revolting and completely ruined my appetite. I was so disgusted that I will be calling the Health Department to report this unsanitary establishment. And if the front of the house is this filthy, I shudder to think about the condition of the kitchen. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this restaurant. Save your stomach and go somewhere else where cleanliness is a priority."

My wife and I stumbled upon this burger joint during our visit to Charlotte and we were excited to try it after seeing it on the Travel Channel. We were greeted with a line out the door, but we were determined to get a taste of their famous burgers. After waiting for what felt like forever, we finally got a spot at the crowded counter.

Now, I will say that the service was top-notch. Our server was friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed. However, the same cannot be said for the food. My burger, the ""Big Block"" with chili, mustard, onions, and coleslaw, was a huge disappointment. The patty was dry and lacked any real flavor. And to make matters worse, the top half of my burger fell apart, making it nearly impossible to eat.

My wife's ""Small Block"" was slightly better, but still far from impressive. And don't even get me started on the sweet potato fries. They were soggy and definitely not worth the price we paid.

In the end, I have to give this place two stars. I really wanted to like it, but the food quality just did not meet our expectations. Maybe it was just a busy day, but for the price we paid, we were expecting much more. Sorry, but we won't be back."

My group and I came to Orange & Brew for a fun Friday night out. The place was bustling with activity and the ambiance was really nice. The decor was eye-catching and they had pool tables and plenty of TVs to keep us entertained. We were all excited to watch the game and try some of their delicious drinks. \n\nBut then, halfway through the game, our waitress delivered some unexpected news - their liquor license had expired and they were no longer able to serve alcohol. She told us we could finish our drinks that we had already purchased, but we couldn't order any more. It was a bit of a disappointment, especially since it was only 9:15pm on a busy Saturday night. It made us wonder how a situation like this could happen to a place that prides itself on its beer selection. Don't they keep track of important things like their liquor license?  \n\nDespite this hiccup, our server was lovely and did her best to make up for the situation. The food was just okay for me - I ordered the mussels appetizer and chicken wings. However, their deluxe tray didn't quite live up to the hype. On the bright side, they had a great selection for kids, which is not something you usually see at a Japanese restaurant. \n\nThe prices were definitely a highlight of our experience, though. We were pleasantly surprised by how reasonable they were, especially for a place that was fully booked for a Valentine's Day dinner event. Overall, while I may consider giving Orange & Brew another chance, it wouldn't be at the top of my list for a fun night out."

That's when I read all the reviews about the \""bait & switch\"" tactics they use there.  \n\nTo make a long story short.  When I asked for a total it was $120!!!!  Plus tip????

Was seated, odered the ham & cheese omelletee with home fries.  Food took about 30 minutes, again no biggie but something to be aware of if you are hungry and/or with children.\n\nFood was dropped off with not much fan fare.  Immedietly I saw a black hair sticking out of the fries.  Eww and Hello!  Did no one see this?  Ate the omelette, was very good but found two more very long black hairs intertwined in the fries.  It was gross.  One hair falls out --ok its unfortunate, but this...was like someone had pulled these long hairs out in wrapped them up in the fries.\n\nNo thanks."
1498,"

This place has some potential, but it falls short in execution. I was excited to try their menu after hearing great things from friends and seeing enticing pictures on social media. However, my experience was underwhelming.

I ordered the chicken cluckers, hoping for a delicious twist on a classic chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, it was a lackluster dish that I found myself constantly forgetting about halfway through. I ended up focusing on the chili and fries as my main sources of sustenance. The chili was decent, but nothing to write home about. The fries, on the other hand, were the saving grace of my meal. The Parmesan and sweet potato fries were both fantastic and I couldn't get enough of the delicious sauces that accompanied them.

The service was hit and miss. While we were promptly seated, it took multiple attempts to get our rolls. On the bright side, our server was prompt in bringing our drinks, including the Strawberry Sickle which was a delicious and refreshing choice. However, I do question the amount of alcohol in the drink as I couldn't really taste it.

The atmosphere was a bit off-putting as well. I couldn't help but notice the floors were being cleaned and the peanuts were being removed from the floor as we were seated. It was certainly a unique choice for a restaurant and not one that I personally found appealing.

Ultimately, for the price we paid (which was quite steep for two burgers and two sides), I expected a higher level of quality and innovation. While I may return to give this place another chance, it won't be a top choice for future dining experiences. There are other restaurants with similar menu items that I know I can rely on for a satisfying meal. Overall, it was a forgettable dining experience that I'll try to remember to order something different next time."

I recently had an iPod dock installed in my SUV at this shop. I was really excited about the idea and the employees seemed knowledgeable and friendly when I called to make the appointment. However, my experience with the installation process was less than ideal.

Despite going in on three separate occasions, there were multiple issues with the installation. The first time, the radio wasn't working at all and I had to return the next day to have it fixed. Not only that, but when my dashboard was put back together, it was done incorrectly due to a mistake made by the person who picked up my car for me. This meant I had to make a second return trip to get it fixed properly.

Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed with the whole process. I had high hopes for this place, but the constant back-and-forth and inconvenience of having to return multiple times definitely soured my experience. I wish I could give a better review, but unfortunately, the lack of attention to detail and follow-through on the employees' part left a lot to be desired.

The only silver lining was the fact that the guys who helped me were incredibly nice and apologetic during both of my return trips. However, even their friendly demeanor couldn't make up for the overall disappointment and hassle I experienced with this installation. I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, I just can't give it a high rating based on my experience. "
1500,Been here at least a dozen times and let me say the food ( depending on the cooks on duty ) is awesome! But the service will leave such a bad taste in your mouth that you'll probably not come back more then once. As for myself I'm probably not going back for awhile in hopes that management gets it together. Till then I'd suggest Honey Salt instead. Food is just as good if not better and the service is great.
1501,"Maybe it's what I ordered but i wasn't impressed with this place at all.  Their decor was really nice especially with their chocolate fountain.  \n\nWe ordered the crepe with the exotic fruits on it. All it had was the crepe, the fruits were I guess all pureed together and bit of mango.  Since all the fruits were pureed, to me it tasted and had the texture of baby food! It was too weird and not so good. The ice cream that it came with was pretty good though.  It was coconut and it had real coconut shavings in it.\n\nOverall, the place is cute, but everything is really overpriced.  Our crepe was $10 and looking at everything else, it's pretty overpriced. But then again, what do you expect?  it's vegas!"
1502,"Awful awful awful service. These girls were SO unfriendly and completely wasted mine and my friend's time. They kept making us repeat ourselves and when they didn't have ANY of the things we wanted, they tried to sell us different versions. Like a different shade of concealer. Um, NO THANKS. When ONE OF the registers ran out of paper, the girl made us wait even though there was a fully functional register right next to it. She also took so long to refill it.. like on purpose, so slow. It was really really disrespectful. She also gave my friend the wrong products. It was a truly terrible experience."
1503,"

The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about this restaurant is ""overpriced"". The food may be good, but it is far from worth the hefty prices you have to pay. And let's not forget the portion sizes - they are ridiculously small! I mean, even a petite Asian girl like myself was left feeling hungry after shelling out $379 for a meal for three people. That's just unacceptable. 

And don't even get me started on the dishes that are supposed to be shared between two or three people. I can understand wanting to encourage a communal dining experience, but not at such high prices for such small servings. It's almost like they're trying to get you to spend more money by ordering more dishes. 

Also, beware of the Peking duck with foie gras in moo-shu skin - it may sound fancy, but at $26 for just four bite-size pieces, it's more like a rip-off. And let's not forget the $48 and $68 Wagyu beef tataki and with truffle prices. Sure, truffle is expensive, but come on, that's just excessive. 

To top it all off, the management of this place seems to be focused on squeezing every last penny out of their customers. I've heard rumors of them charging extra for certain tables or giving preferential treatment to certain guests. That's just not how you run a respectable establishment. 

In the end, I would not recommend wasting your money here. Sure, the food may be tasty, but it's not worth the price and hassle. Save your money and go to a different restaurant where you can actually enjoy a satisfying meal without emptying your pockets."
1504,Good local spot. Margaritas are too sweet. Poor waitress had the whole floor all to herself. I witnessed some people waiting behind me that left cause they were waiting so long for someone to take their order. They have a salsa bar in the back with some descent salsa. In would def come back for the tortilla soup. We ordered enchiladas. The chicken was tasty. Decor is cute with overhead hanging lights. This is not a crazy party spot or anything. Prob wouldn't come with a group cause of slow service.
1505,"Listen, the place is kitschy, silly and if you are into seriously tacky Mexican reproduced goods this is your mecca. Unfortunately for the owners,I will not support bad customer service.

As someone who has been a fan of the Mad Greek restaurant in Baker, CA for years, I was excited to try out their location in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to the expectations set by its counterpart. The first issue we encountered was the lack of staff. It was clear that they were understaffed and overwhelmed, leading to slow service and chaos in the kitchen. Our food arrived overcooked and greasy, with the lettuce and tomatoes in our gyros appearing to be half rotten. But the disappointment didn't end there. The service was practically non-existent unless you were Greek, leaving us feeling like we were being discriminated against. We had heard great things about their food, but this place was nothing like the one in Baker. To make matters worse, we were on our way to another restaurant but decided to stop here since we had been to the Baker location. What a big mistake that was! Needless to say, we will not be making that mistake twice. Save yourself the trouble and just go to Paymons instead. And to the management of the Mad Greek, get your act together and start treating all of your customers with respect and providing quality food and service. The Greek hospitality that is so highly touted at your establishments was nowhere to be found here. Don't waste your time or money at this poorly managed location."

""Do not waste your time and money here. I came to this place hoping for a new and good experience since it was close to my new home. Unfortunately, it was anything but that. The atmosphere was drab and tacky, with an outdated color scheme that felt like a converted ballroom from the 90s (not a good look for a restaurant). The service was also terribly unimpressive, particularly from the hostess who seemed completely lost and uninterested in providing a pleasant dining experience. And as for the food, it was forgettable as we were already put off by the atmosphere and service. \n\nMy disappointment with this place only grew after having a negative experience at another recommended restaurant in the area. I was looking for a place with local flair and high-end service like The Mission in Old Town, but this was not it. The menu was mediocre and the hostess tried to seat us in a small lounge area instead of the main dining room. When we insisted on a nicer dining experience since it was my birthday, she just looked confused and played with her hair (it was almost comical if I wasn't so frustrated). And even though the restaurant was practically empty, she seated us in an awkward spot with another couple staring at us. To make matters worse, their special was the same as the one at the other disappointing restaurant. Needless to say, we left and decided to have a quiet night in instead. Don't bother with this place, save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere for good food and service."""

Beyond that they have most of the other common drugstore products.  You have to sign up for their rewards card if you want to get the sale prices, tho."

We were really hoping for a great stay at this hotel during our family vacation, but unfortunately, it was a letdown. On the surface, the hotel seemed fine with comfortable beds and a decent location. However, within a few hours of checking in, we were horrified to find two BED BUGS! One was even crawling next to my sleeping son's head. We immediately checked out and moved to a different hotel in the middle of the night. The staff was not at all sympathetic and it took some convincing to get our refund. Surprisingly, there was also no manager on duty and despite leaving our contact information, we never received a call back. It was clear that the hotel did not handle this situation well and we were left feeling uncomfortable and disappointed.

Aside from the bed bugs, there were other issues with this hotel. First of all, there are no elevators, which is definitely not convenient when you have kids and luggage to carry. We were placed on the second floor, adding an extra challenge to our stay. Additionally, there was a strange, loud noise that we could never identify. It was quite annoying and disrupted our sleep. Overall, the hotel experience was terrible and we would not recommend staying here. We even had to thoroughly clean and inspect all of our belongings to ensure that we didn't bring any bed bugs with us. This was a major inconvenience and ruined what should have been a relaxing vacation. Proceed with caution if you decide to book a room here."

The atmosphere at this place is definitely unique, with an old-school Vegas vibe. And let me tell you, their burgers are no joke. But there was one major issue that put a damper on our dining experience. We tried calling in our order ahead of time, but could not get through on the phone. And when we got to the restaurant, there were hardly any customers inside and no one was using the phone. We couldn't help but wonder if they purposely keep the phone off the hook during busy times to avoid taking orders. This definitely left a bad taste in our mouths. But if you can overlook this shady business practice, the food and atmosphere are worth checking out."

I've been a regular at this boba spot for some time now and I have to say, it's my go-to spot in town. The prices are very reasonable and the boba is always on point. I also love the fact that they offer food options here as well. On my recent trip, I tried the duck wraps and the egg and tomato ramen, and let me tell you, both were incredibly tasty. It's a shame that their food is not mentioned more often because it's definitely worth trying. What impresses me the most is that everything is made from fresh ingredients, so you know you're getting quality. My only critique would be that it can get a bit crowded at times, but hey, that's a testament to how popular this place is. Overall, I highly recommend giving this place a try. You won't be disappointed! "

I was in the mood for some good ramen, so I decided to give this place a try. But let me tell you, my experience here was far from enjoyable. First of all, the line to get in was ridiculously long. We waited for nearly 30 minutes just to be seated. And once we finally got to order, things started to go downhill. The broth in the ramen was just way too salty. I couldn't even finish my bowl because of it. And it didn't help that the portion size was pretty small, so I expected the flavors to be spot on. But I was disappointed. The environment inside the restaurant was also lacking. It was so hot inside that I couldn't even feel the AC. And let me tell you, when you're eating something hot and spicy like ramen, you definitely want some AC to cool you down. The only saving grace was that there was a Kung fu tea next door that helped distract us from the long wait. Otherwise, we probably would have left already. Honestly, not worth the wait or the money."

After hearing great things about this restaurant, my group and I were excited to try it out. However, our experience fell short of our expectations. The service was incredibly slow, despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy. We couldn't help but notice the staff chatting with their friends instead of attending to the few customers they had.

As for the food, it was just okay. I had heard that this place was known for its healthy options, but I couldn't help but question the actual health benefits after trying it. It seemed that they were just trying to compensate for a lack of flavor by piling on extra granola.

Overall, I was unimpressed with this restaurant and don't see myself returning. There are plenty of other places in the area with better service and higher quality food. I'll stick to getting my juice at Whole Foods from now on."

I've stayed at a lot of hotels in my life, but this one takes the cake for being the worst. First of all, when my husband and I checked in, we were greeted by a Spanish-speaking maid who barged into our room without any warning. To make matters worse, she took our phone and started making calls in Spanish before abruptly leaving. We complained to the front desk, but it seemed like they didn't really care about our experience. And let's talk about the room itself - it was far from sparkling clean and the musty smell was overwhelming. Not to mention, the obnoxiously loud teenagers running around the halls all night were beyond annoying. When we finally called security, they did nothing but out us to the noise-makers next door. And just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, it took two hours for us to get an extra blanket for our bed. Needless to say, our sleep was constantly interrupted by hotel staff. And the area surrounding the hotel? Let's just say, I felt the need to carry a switchblade with me at all times. Thank goodness the casino floor, breakfast buffet, and Level 7 club were at least decent. But even those barely made up for the terrible experience we had here. I'll definitely be steering clear of this place in the future."
1515,"We got there around noon on a Tuesday.  It was dead, only 1 guy at the bar.  We waited for about 3 mins before someone noticed we were waiting for a table.

And she was back right away with our drinks.  She took our food order.  We both ordered a soup and an appetizer for lunch.  We waited 15 mins and our soups came out  within 5 mins our food came out too.\n\nIRISH POTATO SOUP - it came out warm, there was only a few chunks of potatoes, and tasted ok.\n\nCHICKEN FINGERS - the chicken was not crispy but hard.

1516," J'ai utilis\u00e9 un groupon pour visiter cette boucherie

First off, let me just say that I am extremely disappointed with my experience at this boucherie. I had been wanting to try it out for a while and finally decided to use my Groupon that I had purchased. However, upon arriving and selecting our meats, we were informed that they no longer accept Groupon deals specific to their location - even though it was still well within the expiration date. I was forced to pay out of pocket for my purchase, which was not what I had planned for my budget. Not only have I wasted my Groupon, but I am now hesitant to support this boucherie and I may even stop purchasing Groupons altogether. Overall, my experience was far from satisfactory and I will not be returning."
1517,"We went to see Maleficent this past weekend and although the movie was good I am not so sure $25 per ticket was worth it. The seats were full off stains, the blankets smelled as if they hadn't been washed in weeks, and the tables do not come out far enough so that you aren't covered in food and crumbs... not sexy for a date night. I was fortunate enough to have enough crumbs down my shirt for a snack later.... um, kinda gross. I must say I was a little worried that I couldn't see my food at all so I was a little freaked that I didn't know if there was a hair in it or not but overall the food tasted good. \n\nI feel there should be a call button so that you can summon the waitress. My burgers were to come with a thousand island sauce however I asked that it be replaced with ketchup. That didn't happen which meant I had a dry hamburger and no way to call her to fix it. By the time someone came to ask if we needed anything else, the food was already cold. \n\nThe apple martini was tasty and the wine bar in the lobby was cool. \n\nTotal cost for the night: \n\n$50 on tix\n$80 on food\n\nPretty pricey for dirty seats. \n\nI don't think I'll be rushing back. I'm going to try out the rest of the fancy movie theaters before I say I'll never be back but trust I won't be back anytime soon."

I recently visited this spot and must say, it was not what I expected. The reviews online had me excited to try it out, but unfortunately, it fell short of its reputation. Upon arrival, we were turned away at the door due to not having the ""right"" ratio of girls to guys. Talk about a disappointment. Thankfully, our casino host was able to work some magic and get us in with no hassle. 

Once inside, it was clear why this place is so popular. It was packed wall to wall with people. The bartenders were quick and efficient, so getting a drink wasn't too much of a problem. But other than that, there wasn't anything particularly special about this place. Maybe it was just an off night, but my friends and I couldn't seem to get into the vibe. We ended up leaving after only an hour. 

Overall, I'd give this place an average rating. It's definitely not worth the hype, but it's not terrible either. If you really want to check it out, I suggest arriving early and making sure you have the right group composition. Otherwise, there are plenty of other options nearby that might be more enjoyable."

I have mixed feelings about this place. For starters, the location is a bit confusing and parking is a nightmare. Thankfully, I went during an off-peak hour and was able to utilize the valet service without any issues. The interior design is unique, with industrial chandeliers and a laid-back, urban vibe. They even have a spacious patio in the back, where a talented singer was entertaining guests during my visit. I didn't get to sit out there, but it looked like a great spot to unwind and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nThe staff here is definitely on point - they're young, attractive, and have a cool, hipster vibe about them. The clientele is a mix of all types, which added to the eclectic atmosphere. I wasn't feeling well during my visit and just needed a place to kill some time before a concert. The waitress was incredibly accommodating and didn't mind that I sat there for a while, reading and taking my time. I ordered their famous pretzels (which, let's be real, is why everyone comes here) and they did not disappoint. Being a non-cheese lover, I was hesitant, but they were actually quite delicious. Although, I have to admit, they were a bit overpriced at $10. I couldn't bring myself to try anything else from the menu after hearing some negative reviews from others, but I do want to come back and give it a fair chance.\n\nOne thing that bothered me was that I had to ask for drink refills. The server was great and very friendly, but she needs to be more attentive to that aspect of the dining experience. On the plus side, the food came out quickly (again, it was just the appetizer, but still). Overall, I would come back at least once more to see if my opinion changes. However, the high prices may be a problem for this place's longevity. \n\nOn a side note, their bathrooms are quite interesting and my friend swears by their Bacon Bloody Mary. But unfortunately, the mediocre food won't be bringing me back on a regular basis. Mandalay Bay, what were you thinking allowing this subpar restaurant to stay open? Save yourself the disappointment and try one of the amazing buffets nearby. Maybe then this place will get the makeover it desperately needs."

My recent visit to this restaurant had its highs and lows. On one hand, the food was absolutely delicious and the pizzamaker was full of energy and charm. However, my experience was dampened by their outrageous prices. Let's talk about the most perplexing charge of all - a whopping $2.50 for a child's soda. Are you kidding me? Do they think they have a monopoly on soda or something? I couldn't help but feel like I was being ripped off. And that's not the only issue - I found the portion sizes to be quite small, especially for the price. As someone who enjoys trying different dishes, it was disappointing to leave feeling hungry after spending a significant amount of money at this establishment. Overall, while the food and service were great, the excessive pricing left a sour taste in my mouth and will most likely keep me from returning. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to coming back, but the added charges just don't sit well with me. Next time, I'll be sure to read the menu more closely before getting my hopes up."

This place may advertise itself as a wholesome and community-driven establishment, but don't be fooled by the facade. While their outdoor market may seem charming and their locally-sourced ingredients may sound appealing, the truth is that this place falls short in almost every aspect. The rooms are lackluster and the showers are a nightmare. Mold grows rampantly and the water fills up to your knees, making for a less-than-ideal shower experience. Visiting Las Vegas is supposed to be a fun and enjoyable experience, but ending up in a dump with unhygienic shower conditions is far from what anyone would want. I gave this place one last chance, hoping that they would have made some improvements, but unfortunately, it seems like they have not. It's no wonder why this is a budget hotel on the strip - the quality of the stay matches the price. Save yourself the trouble and choose another hotel. Don't make the same mistake I did."

This particular Cracker Barrel is decent enough, but it's nothing to write home about. The service here was good, as we were seated quickly and our server was attentive. The highlight of the meal was definitely the fried chicken - it was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The hash brown casserole was also a standout, with its cheesy goodness, but the turnip greens were mediocre at best. It's clear that the sides here are pre-cooked and sit out most of the day, so it's hit or miss in terms of freshness. My lemonade was deliciously sweet, but also a bit too sugary. This location is always packed, especially on weekends, so be prepared to wait for a table. They do have a gift shop to browse while you wait, but expect to pay a premium for country-themed items. Overall, it's an affordable option for southern-style food, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. However, my dad absolutely loves this place, so it's always a go-to for him."

The Starbucks inside Harris Teeter may seem like a convenient option, but don't be fooled by the lack of crowds. I had a terrible experience with the pharmacy techs who were too lazy to verify my insurance before telling me it was covered. After waiting for what felt like forever at the drive-thru, I was told my prescription was covered. But when I called my insurance company, I found out that nothing had been submitted because my insurance on file was expired. As someone who is already sick, I definitely didn't need this kind of hassle. And don't even get me started on the fact that there are 2 other Starbucks locations within a mile of this one. Disappointing service, to say the least. One star for the pharmacy's incompetence."

I was excited to try out this restaurant with my partner using our gift card. We had heard good things and were looking forward to a delicious meal. However, our experience was far from satisfactory. We started off with two beers and the lettuce wraps, which were decent. But then we received our hot and sour soup, which was lukewarm and lacking any spice or depth of flavor. As for our mains, we ordered the PFC Spicy Chicken and Sesame Chicken with a mix of white and brown rice. The chicken was overcooked and dry, and the sauces were lacking any real flavor. It was disappointing, to say the least. And to top it off, our desserts were miniature versions of cheesecake and chocolate cake, which ended up being overpriced and unremarkable. On top of the subpar food, our server Clint seemed uninterested and unengaged with our table. Overall, we left feeling unsatisfied and wishing we had chosen a different restaurant to use our gift card."

After hearing great things about this bakery, my friends and I decided to stop by and try some of their famous cakes. Unfortunately, our experience was far from what we expected. The ambiance was nice, but the view of a busy and brightly-lit shopping center parking lot was a bit of a downer. However, what truly disappointed us was the lackluster flavors in our cakes. Despite the reasonable pricing and nice plating, the dishes just didn't deliver in terms of taste.

But what really left a bad taste in our mouths was the staff and management's attitude towards customer satisfaction. We were shocked when we were turned away at 9:30PM on two separate weekend nights because of limited hours, despite hearing that this was a popular spot among locals. It's clear that they just don't seem to be trying very hard for excellence, and to be honest, there are too many better choices nearby for us to bother with this bakery again.

I sincerely hope that the customer service has improved since my visit, but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It's a shame because the young man at the counter was very polite and apologetic, but unfortunately, his boss seemed to have a different mindset. It's hard to understand why they would be willing to turn away paying customers, but maybe their business is just that good. In the end, my friends and I ended up going to another bakery down the street, and let me tell you, their cakes were not only delicious, but the customer service was top-notch. So if you're looking for a place to satisfy your sweet tooth, I suggest giving Luisa's a try instead. Trust me, they're just better at the cake business."

I was drawn to Nails@ because of the great designs and gel art I saw on yelp. However, I was left feeling very unsatisfied with the service I received. Despite the positive reviews and beautiful pictures, my experience at Nails@ was far from perfect. From start to finish, there were multiple red flags that left me questioning the quality of this salon.

Firstly, I noticed that my manicurist did not completely remove my previous nail polish before starting the gel manicure. As a result, there were still specks of my previous teal polish visible around the edges of my coral nails. This attention to detail was lacking throughout the entire service. My gel polish was also applied unevenly and thickly, leaving it prone to chipping after just two days. For the high price I paid for the gel manicure, I expected it to last at least a full week without any damage.

Furthermore, the application of my manicure was rushed and haphazard. There was no attention given to painting close to the cuticle, leaving my nails looking like they had a week's worth of growth already. And while the pedicure was decent, it was nothing to rave about. The only highlight of my experience at Nails@ was the wide variety of polish colors available.

Overall, I was left disappointed and dissatisfied with my visit to Nails@. While they may have a strong presence on yelp, their services and attention to detail do not live up to the hype. I will continue my search for a new nail salon in Vegas, and unfortunately, it won't be at Nails@. Save your money and find somewhere else to get your nails done."

I was really excited to try U-Drift after hearing all the hype. The idea of drifting around a track sounded like a thrilling experience. However, my visit to the LV Speedway location left me underwhelmed. First of all, it was a bit difficult to find the place. Their website had conflicting information and the address on the Groupon was misleading. It took me a while to finally arrive at the correct location. \n\nUpon arrival, the staff seemed friendly enough and my instructor, Drew, was enthusiastic and patient. He showed me the ropes and we even went for a couple of high-speed laps together. However, the cars themselves were in pretty rough shape. It didn't affect the actual drifting experience, but it was a bit disappointing to see. \n\nI was having a good time at first, but as the session went on, I noticed that the cars were not as responsive as I had hoped. I struggled to get the hang of drifting and couldn't quite figure out the right techniques. Drew was encouraging, but I couldn't help feeling a bit frustrated. It seemed like there were too many variables to keep track of - approach speed, turning, acceleration, throttle - and it was hard to get a feel for the car. By the end of the session, I was exhausted and didn't feel like I had made much progress. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but I left feeling disappointed. I wasn't willing to spend more money on another session to try and improve. The overall experience just didn't live up to the hype. However, I will say that the staff was friendly and Drew did a great job as an instructor. And the groupon price was a good deal, so I can't complain too much.

We were craving Mexican food and decided to try Serranos for the first time. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about. It's definitely not authentic Mexican food, more like Mexican food for gringos. At best, it would get a 2-star rating from us.

But what really ruined our experience was the service. It started off well enough, with the hostess telling us the wait for a table would be 15 minutes. We grabbed some margaritas while we waited, but before we could even finish them, the hostess came to take us to our table. Our server didn't show up for another 15-20 minutes after that, and it took even longer to get our drinks. When our food finally arrived, it had mistakes - my husband's soup was served in a cup instead of a bowl, and our guacamole never came out at all.

Throughout the night, we felt like we were being passed around to different waiters and busboys. It seemed like there was a serious lack of organization and training. Our server apologized for the poor service, but we could tell he was just running around and seemed stressed. Overall, the service left a lot to be desired.

We've seen mixed reviews for Serranos, and unfortunately, our experience falls into the negative category. We probably won't be returning anytime soon."
1532,"After reading the numerous positive reviews and being a short walk from the hotel I canceled a reservation at another restaurant and the family headed on over. The clientele  was a bit eclectic...mostly older establishment types, but intermixed with everything from young bachelorette party-goers to aging Saturday Night Fever aficionados. The mixed clientele was a harbinger of the meals to come with  tantalizing appetizers and desserts, but major disappointments with the main courses.\n\nWhen the appetizers arrived, we knew we made the right call. The briny muscles with loads of garlic, tomatoes, capers, olives in a savory wine sauce were divine. The lobster gnocchi was loaded with crab and lobster...very rich and satisfying. The Caprese salad was made with the freshest tomatoes and mozzarella...all top shelf.  \n\nThen the dinners arrived...a Mahi-Mahi filet served over Spanish rice look disheveled on the plate. The mahi-mahi was grilled adequately, but the Spanish rice tasted like something my mother made from a box. Overly spicy and completely obliterating the fish. Next were the recommended scallops. They looked like they had been sitting under the lights for hours. They appeared pallid on the plate...just sitting their lifeless surrounding a pile of wilting greens. Finally the chicken dish was simply bland...inadequately seasoned and completely forgettable. \n\nWe needed something to cleanse our palates from the dinner, so took a chance on dessert and were pleasantly surprised. The rich and hot chocolate chip cookie covered with creamy vanilla ice cream were a hit. \n\nIt's hard to figure how a place that does appetizers so well could completely miss on its main courses...not one, but all of them. Maybe the kitchen just had an off night, but for a restaurant in this price range the batting average needs to be a lot higher. My recommendation is to stick to the appetizers and a nice glass of wine."

I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Luxor's More Buffet. The first thing that struck me was the outdated and dingy dining area, which definitely could use a cosmetic upgrade. But what truly ruined my appetite was the mediocre and tasteless food. I had been recommended this buffet by locals, but it's clear that they have lower standards when it comes to food compared to tourists. The lunch and dinner buffets were almost identical, making me question the freshness of the food. The only additional item for dinner was some cocktail shrimp, which did little to improve the overall quality. The only positive aspect of my visit was the fast and attentive service, with plates being cleared and drinks being refilled promptly. But even that couldn't make up for the lackluster dining experience. Next time, I will definitely be asking the tourists where to find a decent buffet."

On my recent trip to Las Vegas, I couldn't resist trying out the famous Bayside Buffet at the Mandalay Bay. As a self-proclaimed buffet connoisseur, I always make sure to hit up at least one during my stay in Sin City. And let me tell you, Bayside did not disappoint...but it also didn't exactly blow me away.

Don't get me wrong, there were definitely some highlights of this buffet. The hot carving station with prime rib and turkey was top-notch, and the ""make your own"" pasta bar was a fun and tasty addition. And let's not forget about the seafood - crab legs and shrimp galore - which were definitely a standout. As an Asian, I know we're often stereotyped as piling our plates high with shellfish at buffets in Vegas, and I have to admit, I may have succumbed to that stereotype this time around. But hey, who can resist good seafood?

However, there were also some low points. The line was long, but luckily they had those nifty walk-up payment machines. The only downside? You still had to wait in line with everyone else who was paying at the register, making the whole thing feel a bit pointless. And while the buffet was reasonably priced at $30-ish for adults, I couldn't help but feel a bit underwhelmed by the overall quantity and quality of the food offerings.

But let's get to the real reason why I gave this place a middle-of-the-road rating. The service was efficient and the place was clean, but there was just something missing in terms of ambiance and atmosphere. Maybe it was the lack of variety or the lack of standout dishes, but it just didn't have that wow factor that I look for in a buffet.

All in all, Bayside Buffet at the Mandalay Bay is a decent option for a quick and easy dinner during your Vegas trip. But for those looking for a truly exceptional and memorable buffet experience, I would recommend checking out some other options on the Strip. You won't regret it."

My experience at Hot N Juicy left much to be desired. I was excited to try the concept of seafood in a bag, with no utensils needed. However, my enthusiasm quickly dissipated when I realized the sauce I ordered was extremely salty - think Ramen noodle flavor packet salty. The spice level was also lackluster, despite ordering the spiciest option. On a positive note, the seafood itself was tasty and well-cooked. 

My main issue with this place was the hit-or-miss wait staff. They were not very attentive and it took a while for them to come around. The atmosphere was also all over the place, with loud music and a lack of soap in the bathroom. As someone who loves a good margarita, I was disappointed with their bar situation and ended up giving the bartender some tips on how to improve their drinks. 

Overall, the experience was mediocre at best. I would recommend giving it a try for the unique concept and tasty seafood, but be cautious of the sauces. And maybe bring your own soap, just in case. "

Occasionally, the chicken arrives overcooked and dry.  The steak has been consistently pleasant and is quite tasty, moreso on its own than when mixed with the other ingredients.  The beans are always plain and the watery salsa certainly isn't anything to write home about, but it all works in that way that simple, decent \""comfort\"" food should.  \n\nAs for price, it's certainly not as \""cheap\"" as some make it seem, but it won't break the bank, either.

If you've got a picky date, this is the perfect place to take them, because they'll only have to make one decision...chicken or beef!\n\nPlease note that there is really nothing \""wrong\"" with El Pollo Supremo.  However, there is nothing particularly outstanding about it, either.  \n\nThe 5-star and \""100%\"" ratings across the internet review boards are certainly more than it deserves.

The food?  Oh my, it's been a while since I've such slop.  The calimari was not edible, over cooked, tasteless.  Oh and what's that dip?  Mayonaise, from a jar.  Seriously the food tasted like they went to the market, and not the upscale one, bought some food, unpackaged it, marked up the cost 1000% and called it Italian.  Don't bother.  I actually left 95% of the food on the plate, paid and left.  oh well"
1539,"These cupcakes were ok, but they taste just like they are from the grocery store. I dont know what's up with the frosting, it just has a strange taste. When I got there, there were hardly any cupcakes left, so my selection was limited, if they wouldn't have been buy one get one free, I would have never paid the prices they want for those cupcakes. It's ok, i would eat them again, but I don't think I will ever be going back. Sprinkles wins, hands down, anyone who says otherwise is nuts!"

I was referred to Mainor Wirth after a car accident in 2012 and let me tell you, it was a complete nightmare. Not only did it take nearly two years to get any sort of compensation, but I basically had to do all of the work myself. What's even worse is that I couldn't even get a hold of my assigned lawyer, Jennifer, when I needed her. She seemed more interested in catering to their ""big clients"" rather than helping me, a regular person in need of assistance.

But the worst part? I still had to pay them their hefty lawyer fees when they didn't even do their job properly. It's pathetic that they can't even provide decent customer service and yet expect us to foot the bill. It's all about the money for them, no matter how poorly they treat their clients.

Save yourself the hassle and go to a different law firm. Trust me, you don't want anything to do with Mainor Wirth. They are completely worthless and only care about filling their pockets. Don't make the same mistake I did and waste your time and money with them."
1541,"Where to start? My husband LOVED the gin & tonic's here, but not because of what you would think. The circle ice cubes won his heart. He in fact loves them so much we now have molds to make circle ice cubes at home. Only they are not crystal clear like Jaleo's are, so we fail.\n\nI did enjoy this restaurant. It was fun, unique, and the food was great. The only issue I have is that we spent about $150 (did include alcohol), and we were not full when we left. I'm a big eater, and tapas apparently are just not my thing. Unless of course it includes an entr\u00e9e afterwards.\n\nThe food was very good though. Every dish (with the exception of one), was amazing. The fried bacon-wrapped dates were amazing, and the paella that we ordered was fabulous. The one thing that fell short for us was something our server suggested, that ended up being a bag of chips (seriously - and a fun-size bag of chips at that), with a ketchup-y sauce drizzled over the chips. \n\nI did like the presentation of most of the tapas, one even came in a shoe! The atmosphere is very fun and unique, I also love that you can see the food being cooked. We ordered a porrone of spiked cider, and that was fabulous! \n\nOverall, the price is what got me. For Vegas, it's actually not that bad. But for me, if I spend that much money, I want to leave full."

Wanted to try this place out for a while and finally got the chance last weekend. The ambiance was great, with a live band playing in the lounge and a lively atmosphere. The menu looked promising, so we decided to try out their tacos. The carne asada and pork options were just okay, nothing special. However, the shrimp taco was surprisingly tasty. The drinks were a bit overpriced, with pitchers of beer costing a whopping $17, but we were willing to splurge for the overall experience. Unfortunately, the heat inside the restaurant was unbearable. We were sweating bullets the whole time and couldn't fully enjoy our meal. To make matters worse, when I ordered a bottle of Bud Light, I received a can instead. Not a huge deal, but still disappointing. Overall, it was an average dining experience. We might try it again for the crab legs, but for now, we'll stick to America's Taco Shop for our carne asada fix."
1543,"If you had asked me a month ago, I would have given this place 5 stars.  Sadly, after my second visit, I feel the need to write this review.\n\nThe food and beer selection at O.H.S.O. is pretty great, which is why I didn't give them 1 star.  In fact, my first time here was pretty good.  I thought this would be a go-to when I come to town, but then I had dinner there this past week, and well, I'm never going back.\n\nNow, I admit, I'm a picky eater and I like to modify my dinner.  I live in LA, where almost every single person I know modifies in some form or fashion, and it's rare for that to be an issue.  You would think a restaurant in a city as big as Phoenix would see a lot of that, too.  However...\n\nWhen it came time for me to order my meal, I started to explain that I would prefer my pizza with no cheese, and a few other items off of it.  The last time I had been there, this was not a problem at all, and that server was happy to help me.  THIS time, I unfortunately was served by Brooke, who not only didn't help me, but she served up a healthy portion of her less-than-helpful attitude.  Upon ordering, she told me \""You could do that - but it's not gonna taste very good\"" (in a pretty b****-y tone, mind you).  That's funny - I don't remember asking her opinion of what I wanted to eat!  I've actually worked in the service industry before, and there is a way to let a customer know that a certain dish might not be as palatable that doesn't include a rude and condescending tone.  Little did she know that I had eaten the same exact dish a month prior and enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nIn a town that has a lot of restaurants, I hope this is a lesson to treat customers like you prefer they come back again, and appreciate their business while they are there."

We had high hopes for Cento, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a major disappointment. We were excited to try their tapas-style dishes and thought the eclectic menu would offer something for everyone. However, the food fell flat. The patatas bravas, which our server warned us ""is not traditional but rather consists of thin potatoes"", were nothing more than a bag of store-bought potato chips with some sauce and mayo on top. Seriously, I could have made this at home for a fraction of the cost. And don't even get me started on the beef sliders. They were so greasy and overly salty that we struggled to take more than one bite. As for their ""signature shrimps"", well, they were just okay. Definitely not worth the hype or the price. \n\nBut the real scam was when we received the bill. Not only were our drinks overpriced, but we noticed that they had charged us double for each one. We had to call our server over to rectify the situation, and even then it seemed like they were just trying to brush it off instead of apologizing for their mistake. \n\nOverall, we were extremely disappointed with our experience at Cento. The cocktails were decent, but unfortunately, that's the only positive thing I can say. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was lacking. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go elsewhere."

This cake decorating store has a great selection of supplies for all your baking needs. I was able to find everything I needed for my cake pops, from sprinkles and candy melts to molds and boxes. However, I have to say that their prices are a bit steep. I have found similar items at other stores for cheaper, especially when using a coupon. But I do appreciate the variety of products they offer. 

The store itself is beautifully decorated and the staff is friendly. However, I do wish they had longer store hours. As someone who works during the day, it's difficult to make it to the store before they close at 5:30pm. I would love to attend some of their classes, but the timing just doesn't work for me. 

Overall, it's a great store if you're willing to pay a little extra for the convenience and selection. But if you're looking for a bargain, you might want to shop around first."
1546,"We lost a legend of deli's and it is replaced with a somewhat chain restaurant called So we MEAT again. The sandwich left much to be desired, the bread was mediocre and the thinly sliced piece of cheese on my sandwich brought a tear to my eye. The kabanosy sausage tasted over processed but a bit tasty with all the garlic inside, but the after taste was not pleasing. I may make the trek to the Stanley's on Bell road but was hoping this place was the birth of the rumored Stanley's that was supposed to branch into 7 new stores. I can't say that I would return to this shop as it was not terrific. There was mention of European goodies like stuffed cabbage and some other dishes during the holidays but is this not the holidays? Turkey day is 3 days away? If I do return here it won't be for a sandwich but maybe some cold cuts, smoked butt and during the holidays. The young lady behind the counter said that Stanley's shared their recipes with them but the menu states that these are passed down through generations of Shannon's deli with no mention of Stanley's. Maybe when they get the smokehouse in the back of the building going they will offer the 60+ unique cuts they promise.\n\n*Update - I drove out to Stanley's on Bell Road, they advised me that So we meat again is not using their recipes or related to their establishment in any way. They also advised me that they are planning to reopen right across the street from their old location but did not quote a date."

I was less than impressed with my experience at this restaurant. Not only was the food mediocre, but the service was subpar. First of all, I have to mention that the hollandaise sauce on my eggs benedict was just okay. It lacked the perfect balance of butter and tanginess that I was hoping for. And let's talk about the sausage. It was nothing special, just your run-of-the-mill sausage patty. But the real disappointment was the jalapenos. They were completely overwhelming and drenched the dish, making it difficult to taste anything else. Not to mention, having the eggs benedict served on a bagel instead of the traditional english muffin was just too much.

But the real issue was with the service. Our waiter seemed uninterested and barely checked on us throughout the meal. And when it was time to pay, we were presented with an overpriced bill. But what really put me off was the fact that they gave my four-year-old son a cheap trinket from their ""treasure chest"" instead of providing good service and delicious food.

Overall, I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone who values good food and quality service. There are plenty of other options in the area that offer both at a much better price point. Save your money and your taste buds and go somewhere else. Trust me, your stomach and your wallet will thank you."

My friend and I decided to try Over Easy on a Sunday morning, expecting it to be packed like most brunch spots in town. To our surprise, we were able to get a table right away! The staff was friendly and accommodating, even bringing me a glass of water while I waited for my friend. We were off to a good start.

The food was decent and came out quickly. I ordered the egg white omelet with asparagus, tater tots, and a side of bacon. The omelet itself was delicious, but the asparagus was a bit greasy, probably from being cooked on the griddle. My friend had the French toast which was nothing special, but still tasty.

My only complaint was the coffee. As a lover of strong coffee, I was excited to see they offered milk instead of cream. However, it was too strong even for me. I had to ask for refills, but our water glasses were constantly being topped off.

We opted to sit outside and enjoyed the cool misters for a while. But eventually, it got uncomfortable and we had to move inside. Overall, I would say Over Easy is a nice spot for a casual brunch. The prices are reasonable and the tater tots are a must-try. While it may not be the best brunch spot out there, I wouldn't mind coming back for another round of their tasty omelets."
1549,"Ichi ban has pretty decent sushi. What really keeps me coming back here though is the half price sushi menu.

1550,The food was average. I will not ever go back because customer service was horrible. There was this bald guy who was really rude to me and my friend today and seem as if he hated his job. If he the manager (not sure if he is one). He should work on his customer service skills.

We decided to check out Ovation for a concert featuring none other than Aaron Lewis from Staind. Let me tell you, the performance was top-notch and I would definitely see him again. As for the venue itself, it's a bit of a mixed bag.

On the outside, Ovation is eye-catching and the inside is no different. However, we were a bit disappointed by the seating situation. We opted for the cheapest tickets, which landed us in the back of the venue. While the view was decent, the chairs were not. They were uncomfortable and the spacing between seats was way too tight. My group ended up having to readjust and push out chairs just to have enough room to sit comfortably. Plus, there was some confusion about seating arrangements, with some people even ending up in the wrong section.

On a positive note, the bar in the back was convenient for grabbing a drink and there were waiters and waitresses available to take orders. VIP booths were also a nice touch for those looking for a more luxurious experience. I could definitely see Ovation being a great venue for events other than concerts. It's spacious and has plenty of room to move around.

However, if you're planning on attending a concert or performance that calls for sitting down, I would caution against buying cheap seats. The rowdier crowd tends to opt for those tickets, making it difficult to fully enjoy the show. If you're a die-hard fan and want the best experience, it's worth splurging for better seating. Otherwise, if you can handle a rowdy crowd and uncomfortable chairs, Ovation is an alright venue overall. I would just recommend doing your research and investing in better seats for the best experience."

I recently stopped by this place after hearing good things about their Korean rice and selection. However, my experience was far from enjoyable. The food court was a complete disaster. The cashier seemed more interested in arguing with the bus boy than taking my order. I even tried to politely intervene but was completely ignored. The altercation continued as I stood there with my money in hand, ready to pay. Frustrated and uncomfortable, I ended up walking away and didn't even get to try their food. This type of service is unacceptable and completely ruined what could have potentially been a decent meal. I may consider giving their Kimchee a try, but I will definitely be avoiding the food court from now on."

I visited Maiya's today for a much-needed pedicure. The salon was bustling and I was excited for some pampering. However, my experience fell a bit short of my expectations. The staff seemed overwhelmed and not very attentive to customers' needs. I was also disappointed that they didn't offer me a complimentary water, which is standard at most nail salons. During my pedicure, I noticed water leaking onto my Coach bag from the foot sink. I was surprised that the customer next to me pointed it out instead of the nail technician. The technician continued with the service without addressing the issue. This left me feeling frustrated and neglected. 

To make matters worse, when it came time to pay, I was surprised to hear that my basic pedicure was going to cost $25 instead of the advertised $20. Apparently, my clear nails and use of scrubbing gel added on extra charges. I have never experienced a nail salon trying to upsell during a basic service before. And to top it off, the technician disappeared in the middle of putting on my shoes, leaving me sitting there for 15 minutes until I had to do it myself and leave. 

I can't deny that the salon was popular and many people seemed to enjoy their experience. However, based on my personal experience, I will not be returning to Maiya's. I hope they can improve their customer service and be more transparent about pricing in the future. "

Beware of this park if you value your safety and personal belongings. I learned this lesson the hard way when my car was targeted and broken into in broad daylight. Despite the park being bustling with people, the thieves managed to slip away unnoticed. The police informed me that this is a common occurrence, with 3-4 cars being broken into on a weekly basis. It's truly disappointing that the park doesn't warn hikers of this danger and instead, it's left for us to suffer the consequences.

My day of hiking was ruined by the realization that my car had been robbed. The loss of cash and credit cards is painful, but it's the irreplaceable personal items that broke my heart. It's clear that the thieves are closely watching hikers, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. It's a shame that the park doesn't take more responsibility in keeping its visitors safe.

I urge all hikers to be cautious at this park and not to trust the park's false promises of security. Don't make the same mistake I did by naively assuming that my car would be safe in a busy park. The only thing this park excels in is attracting thieves, not preserving the safety of its guests. Save yourself the trouble and find another park to explore."

I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, the atmosphere is nice and it definitely has an authentic vibe. The decor is outdated and a bit tacky, but it adds to the overall charm. However, the food was a major letdown. I was excited to try the steak arachera taco plate, but it was dry and flavorless. The enchiladas were drenched in what tasted like jarred spaghetti sauce, and don't even get me started on the bean burrito. The chips were stale and it seemed like the leftovers had been reheated multiple times. In fact, one of my dining companions compared it to airplane food. Not exactly a glowing review. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this place. Maybe they just don't know what good food is, or maybe they don't care. Either way, I wouldn't waste your time or money here. There are much better options for Mexican food in this city. Save yourself the disappointment and try somewhere else."

I came to this restaurant with high hopes after reading all the amazing reviews and seeing it constantly packed with customers. As a local, I was excited to finally try it out. My group of friends and I decided to go for the all-you-can-eat option and were eager to start our feast.

However, the experience fell a bit short for me. While the rolls were tasty, there seemed to be a miscommunication between our group and the server. We never received the individual nigiri orders that we had requested, and instead were bombarded with rolls that we didn't even remember ordering. The server also seemed a bit annoyed with us, most likely due to our loud and rowdy group.

I will say, the sushi chef did a great job with the rolls we did receive. They were fresh and flavorful. And while I understand that AYCE restaurants can sometimes get hectic, I wish the staff had paced our orders better and brought out each person's individual order as requested.

Unfortunately, this experience left a sour taste in my mouth and I haven't been able to bring myself to try any dishes with crab since then. Maybe I'll give it another chance with a smaller group in the future, but for now, I'll stick to other sushi spots in the area."
1557,"Seriously!? 4 STARS!?!?! \n\nSo it was Sam's big birthday...he was turning the BIG 2-1... ok who am I kidding... I just turned 21 for the X time. Anyway. \n\nI made reservations here and we showed up mildly on time... After hauling ass through the Venetian Canal Shoppes. We were seated and the ambiance was definitely 5 stars. The service was kick ass and prompt. \n\nThe servers were snazzy and sharp. The steak knives weren't. I had to saw through my darned steak. And it was \""supposedly\"" dry aged. My NY Strip was tough (at medium rare) and not as flavorful as I'd like it. Sam's Ribeye was definitely more tender, but I expected a better steak out of that price. My steak was slightly overcooked. Ok, so I guess it is a mistake to try Wolfgang Puck's steakhouse as he's not known to be a steak-person, but seriously. CUT's a steakhouse. How do you dare mess up on both of our steaks!?\n\nThe mushroom sides were great, sauteed spinach was perfect. Dessert was grand. Sadly, my slab of dead cow... not so much. :("

I was excited to try this highly rated restaurant on a Sunday night. The ambiance was perfect for a date night, with various dining areas to choose from. The hostess informed us of the 20-25 minute wait for our party of two but to our surprise, we were seated within 10 minutes. Impressive, right? Well, my excitement was short-lived as the rest of the experience was a rollercoaster.

The mojito I ordered was delicious and I could have easily had more than one. However, the red sangria was a bit light and almost watered down. We decided to try our waiter's recommendations, the stuffed dates were a definite hit but the Tierra y mar, not so much. The Tuna tartare was the best dish of the night, while the Grilled octopus was a disappointment. Maybe I should stick to raw octopus, but either way, the petite filet and fish sticks made up for it.

But when the bill came, I was reminded of why I had originally decided to try this restaurant - to see what all the hype was about. And honestly, it fell short. A grand total of $65 for 6 tapas and 2 drinks. Not terrible, but I couldn't help but feel the prices were a bit overpriced for what was actually served.

Maybe my expectations were too high based on the reviews, but unfortunately, the food did not meet them. While the service was great and our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly, I don't know if it was enough to justify a return visit. Overall, I was left feeling underwhelmed and wishing I had chosen a different spot for my Sunday night dinner."

I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. Despite the delicious food, the service and cleanliness of the tables just didn't meet my standards. To start off, the counter staff seemed like they'd rather be anywhere else than helping customers. It took forever just to get a drink order in and to my surprise, we were charged $2 for each drink. And to top it off, they didn't even have iced tea, so my friend and I had to settle for tap water. Not exactly what we were hoping for.

Although the food was made just like we asked, the overall experience was pretty lackluster. The tables were dirty and clearly hadn't been cleaned in a while. And don't even get me started on how long it took for our food to come out. It's not like the restaurant was even busy, so I'm not sure what the hold up was.

I couldn't help but notice the lack of attention from the staff. At one point, the blonde bartender seemed to be hiding and avoiding customers altogether. And when she finally did come over to take my friend's drink order, she didn't hear us when we said we wanted one too. It wasn't until a different bartender came to take our order that things started moving along.

But the real kicker was the complete absence of any customer service. Not once did any of the staff check on us during our meal to see if we needed anything. Even when the manager came over, it was only to ask about the food and not the service from his own staff. How's that for service?

Overall, I have to say my visit here was a disappointment. I've been to many other restaurants in the area that offer much better food and service. And based on my experience, I don't think I'll be coming back to this location anytime soon. "
1561,"Went here because of DDD. Definitely a hole in the wall. I would recommend this place if you are hungry and thirsty. I imagine their drinks are very strong. The food though is definitely bar fair, so do not come here expecting a culinary adventure. If you come here starved then the food and portions will definitely satisfy.\n\nI ordered the Boli like I was supposed to, ordered the turkey and cheese one. I was a little disappointed because although the dough was delicious the filling of just cheese and turkey did not satisfy me...maybe some spinach or something?"
1562,"We had a really rough experience at this pool. \n\nFirst of all, it's really tough to find a seat with any shade. When we did find one under an umbrella it was shocking to see a sign saying you had to RENT a chair with shade for 50 bucks! Are you kidding me? I understand the whole renting an exclusive cabana concept but this was just a lounge chair with an umbrella! \n\nI guess it's the Vegas mentality and they are trying to take you for all you're worth. We also asked for a cup of water and were told they could only bring us a bottle, $7 for a small $9 for a large. It should be illegal to not provide water when it's 100 plus degrees.\n\nThe physical pool itself was fine, nice water features and a slide."
1563,"I hate this place. We asked them if they would comp the drinks if we played the bar machines. They said you had to put at least $10 in, which is fair enough.

As what she made it seem (oh well tips included) We felt rushed while ordering and her attitude wasn't so pleasant. We felt as if \""gratuity\"" was included she didn't feel the need to attend to us. Although as i observed she was attending to every other table, taking new orders leaving us behind. Could be just \""our\"" table she happened to be a little \""careless\"" on but to top the not checking up on us at least, Took a while to get her attention to refill our drinks she refilled our drinks which was rasberry icetea with coke instead yuck! and my boyfriend had to go up to the counter himself twice for a refill of the \""right\"" soda. Didn't appreciate her attitude with the lack of horrible service. Her coworkers also mentioned \""again amber that's your 2nd time\"" not a good first time experience. Aside from that, food was good.

We decided to try out 1 OAK for a girls' night out and it ended up being a fun experience. We were immediately greeted and ushered to our VIP table right above the DJ booth - definitely a spot to see and be seen. DJ Cequel was playing that night and he put out some amazing beats that kept us dancing non-stop for four straight hours. I even met a great guy who had some serious dance moves and we hit it off on the dance floor. The only downside was that one of my friends had to pay a $30 cover charge, which seemed a little steep considering we were already spending a fortune on drinks. But hey, it's Vegas, right?

The staff at 1 OAK were friendly, but honestly, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Just your typical club atmosphere with overpriced drinks and a lot of people trying to look cool. But the music was definitely the highlight of the night. It was a mix of different genres and kept us on our feet the entire time. We did take a break from dancing to try out the VIP lounge's chili chocolate powdered fries, but they were honestly a bit of a disappointment. Definitely not as good as the waffle fries at Chick-Fil-A.

Overall, I would say 1 OAK was a decent club experience. It wasn't anything too special or unique, but the good music and VIP table made it worth it. Maybe next time we'll try to snag a table on a different night with a different DJ. But for now, I wouldn't say I'm in a rush to go back."

Let me start off by saying, I was excited to try out Tiffany's based on the reviews and recommendations from friends. However, my experience was far from enjoyable. The atmosphere was definitely unique, with an old school vibe straight from the TV show ""Alice."" But that's where the positives ended.

First off, the lack of options for the breakfast menu was disappointing. No choice of potato? Come on, Tiffany's, step up your game. And while the chicken fried steak was tender and flavorful, the fact that it was slapped on the grill right in front of us made it feel a little too casual for my taste.

But the real issue came with the service. Our waitress was friendly enough, but seemed more interested in making toast and filling coffee cups than actually attending to our needs. And when we asked about the meat used for the CFS, the cook seemed more occupied with showing it off than actually cooking it well. To top it off, upon leaving, we observed the cook exchanging a sly smile with a member of the staff, giving me a gut feeling that something shady was going on.

Overall, Tiffany's might be a fun experience for tourists or those looking for a throwback meal, but for those seeking quality food and service, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. I won't be returning to Tiffany's anytime soon and would not recommend it to others. Better luck next time, Tiffany's."

Pretty sure it was because of the hype around it cuz it was featured on Cake Boss.\n\nWhen you arrive there's a window that overlooks the kitchen. They were making napoleon's (my fav) so I knew that was what I was gonna get when I went to the front of the line.\n\nThe customer service was alright, felt rushed because there was so many people. Paid for a Large Italian Napoleon $6.95. Got it to-go because there was so many people. The napoleon was alright. There was wayyyyyyyyy to much filling, the cream/puff pastry was wayyy too off for me. \n\nHad a red velvet cupcake, your average good cupcake. Appealing to the eye but too much frosting to cake ratio. Had some cannoli and it was pretty bomb, but I still think everything they had was overpriced.\n\nOverall, 2.5 stars. The price was too high for the quality of the food."

The staff at this pizza joint is top-notch, especially Shelly. She is always so welcoming and friendly, making us feel right at home every time we come in. Even when we're just there to grab my son's complimentary pizza for being a good reader, Shelly takes the time to chat with him and make him feel special. It's the little things that make a big difference. And let's be honest, who doesn't love free pizza?"

I used to love Big Lots, but it seems like over the years, it has lost its charm. The department store used to be filled with unique and quirky items, but now it just feels like a disorganized mess. Even the layout has changed multiple times, making it hard to find what you're looking for.

One of my favorite sections, the glass items, has also been disappointing lately. They used to have a great selection of vases and decorative pitchers, but now it seems like they only stock a few generic options. And don't even get me started on the constantly changing prices. One day something will be marked as a great deal, but the next it will be back to its original price.

I also miss the variety in the food section. It used to be filled with unique and international snacks, but now it's just the same old generic brands. And while the prices used to be unbeatable, they've recently been creeping up.

Overall, Big Lots just isn't what it used to be. It's lost its quirkiness and charm and has become just another typical department store. I miss the good old days of finding random treasures for a bargain."

I chose Pure Foot & Spa for a girls' trip to Vegas last weekend. The reviews made it seem like the perfect place for a relaxing break from the chaos of the strip. However, upon arrival, I was disappointed to find that it was just like any other foot massage place on Spring Mountain Road. It was clean and had relaxing music, but nothing special. \n\nI made an appointment for the three of us at 3:30pm and we arrived to find only one other customer getting a massage. We were served tea and asked to wait in the leather seats while we soaked our feet and received a shoulder and arm massage. It was a nice gesture, but not worth the $38 price tag for a 60 minute massage. \n\nSpeaking of the massage, it was just okay. It started with a foot soak (which I could have easily done at home) and then moved on to massaging the feet and calves with lotion. Nothing stood out as exceptional or unique. Oh, but for an extra fee, they will remove calluses and massage your back as well. \n\nThe pricing advertised outside was misleading as well. It started at $28 for 45 minutes, but we were charged $38 for the 60 minute massage. And don't forget to factor in a tip and a $1 fee for using a credit card. Add on the $13 taxi ride from Palazzo and it was a pricey experience that was nothing special. \n\nWould I go back? Probably not. But I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it out for themselves. Who knows, maybe their back massages are amazing. My experience was just average and not worth the hype. "
1574,"Three stars means A-OK and that's what this place is, OK. Not bad, not awesome, but halfway decent. \n\nI have to say that the service is very good. They're really friendly here and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. It's a pretty small place but clean and comfortable with the fun lobster tank outside.\n\nWe basically came here because it was close by to the hotel and it was relatively cheap. There is certainly much better sushi to be had in Vegas and there is certainly much better AND more expensive sushi to be had. We wanted to keep things easy and cheap. \n\nThey have a good selection and all the usual suspects are present. Didn't see any particularly unusual or creative things on the menu but you've got your spicy tuna, salmon skin, rainbow rolls and all the rest. The fish was pretty fresh and it was presently nicely but it just lacked a \""Wow this is so delicious\"" factor. Salmon skin was a little fishy and the spicy tuna a little chewy and not as spicy as I would like. \n\nI do think it's an OK value if you are lazy and cheap and in the area but I wouldn't make any specific plans on coming here as it wasn't that good. Next time I would probably make the effort to go somewhere with better quality food for similar prices (even if it means not being so lazy and actually getting into a cab)."

I recently visited this Indian restaurant for the first time, with an open mind and a willingness to try new things. I was unsure whether to give it 3 or 4 stars because of some positive aspects, like the naan bread, rice pudding, and sugary dough balls that I couldn't get enough of. I loved dipping the bread into the flavorful masala sauces, and being half Filipino, rice is my go-to side dish. However, I was disappointed with the grain of the rice they served. It was different from what I'm used to and didn't enhance the dishes as much as it could have.

While the curry had a nice kick to it, I found myself comparing it to my favorite panang curry and feeling a bit let down. The food wasn't bad, but it just couldn't live up to my high expectations. I even discussed it with a colleague who recommended another Indian restaurant, Tandoori Times, for their delicious food. However, the prices at Indian Paradise were much more reasonable, especially since it was a buffet.

Ultimately, I don't see myself craving Indian food on a regular basis, but I would still be open to going with friends who are in the mood for it. However, I might just stop at a Thai restaurant beforehand to pick up some jasmine rice to bring along. Overall, my first Indian dining experience was underwhelming and left me longing for something more satisfying."

The overall experience at this chain was quite mediocre. My intention was to try to make a healthier choice, but unfortunately, it fell short. The grilled chicken on my sandwich was a thick piece of breast, which is usually a good sign, but it was dry and lacked any real flavor. The pretzelish bun it came served on was a bit odd and I had to ask for mayo at the counter to make it more bearable. Though the green beans with red onions were decent, they had a canned or frozen taste, not at all fresh.

One redeeming factor of my visit was the free custard of the day, which was a Nestle crunch swirl. This is where Culver's truly excels ‚Äì in their frozen custard selections. It was the highlight of my meal.

On a separate note, I recently stayed at a beautiful hotel, but unfortunately, there was construction going on which made navigation a bit confusing. The woman at the reservation desk seemed overwhelmed and took nearly 10 minutes to inform us that our room had been lost. She was not very accommodating and refused to let us speak to a manager. After some persistence, we were able to speak to the manager ourselves and he was very professional and understanding. He upgraded our room to a better view, which was a nice gesture.

Overall, the confusion upon arrival put a damper on the experience, but the beautiful room made up for it. It's a shame that the service did not match the lovely accommodations. "
1577,"Located in the most haunted graveyard of Edinburgh, this shop sure sells overpriced souvenirs. It's the stuff that would appeal to small kids or work perfectly as a joke, but to be fair most of the stuff you buy here will loose their novelty quickly and end up either at your local charity or at the back of your shelves. Basically, they are creepy and gory stuff you find in most \""scary\"" gift shops around the city, from plastic gooey eyeballs to witch puppets and spooky stories of Edinburgh. And there sure are plenty of stories!\n\nThe shop is certainly wee, and the staff are friendly enough, if not terribly bored to be surrounded by this gimmicky stuff. What works is that if you are after something along the lines I described above, then it all seems to be congregated in this one room just at the entrance of the graveyard."
1578,"I heard about this place for years before I actually went in yesterday. It was disappointing. It ended up being a dark, humid, little sweatbox (note: bad smells!) of a coffee shop, with very little seating and terrible hours for a CenPho location (open til 3 on a Sunday...are you serious?). I ordered an Americano, which was actually quite tasty, but switched with my girlfriend because the Chai tea latte she ordered was subpar. Instead of a syrup or a powder, Drip just brews a bag of Chai and then adds milk. What you get is nothing like a Chai tea latte, but rather a milky tea that left me with gas for 16 hours. Skip this hangout."

Honestly, I was pretty underwhelmed by this place. My significant other kept raving about their BLT with avocado and a half-cooked egg on it, but when we finally went, I couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. Sure, the waitresses were overly friendly and flirty with him, but that doesn't make up for the subpar food.

I tried their veggie egg white omelet, which sounded delicious with caramelized onions and broccolini. But the taste was just off. It was like they cooked it in the same pan as all their greasy burgers and the end result was just gross. I'm not even a strict vegetarian and I couldn't finish it.

The English muffin it came with was pretty much useless, but at least it was a good vessel for their apricot preserves. The chocolate cherry scones were the only highlight of the meal, along with the decent coffee. But even that wasn't enough to save the experience.

To make matters worse, the booth next to us was occupied by a group of hungover 20-somethings who thought it would be funny to blast music from their phones and iPods. And later, I saw one of them crying in the lobby. Needless to say, it wasn't a pleasant atmosphere to dine in.

I might give this place another chance, just for my SO's sake. But I'll definitely stay away from anything that comes off the grill. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good meal, but if you're into flirty waitresses and rowdy diners, then this might be the spot for you."

Save your money and your appetite and go to a different A and W location.

I've been to this buffet for brunch several times before and never really enjoyed it, but that all changed when I went for dinner this past Monday night! Maybe it was because I was finally sober and able to fully appreciate the food, or maybe it was because we were able to skip the long line and get seated right away as Diamond members of Total Rewards. Either way, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and variety of food at this buffet.

Let's start with the price - $108 for two people may seem steep, but trust me, it's worth it. Especially compared to the $80-$90 you'd pay for brunch on a weekend, which includes unlimited mimosas. And if you happen to be a Total Rewards member, use those points for a free meal! That's what we did and it made the dining experience even better.

The variety of food here is amazing. Chinese, sushi, pho, prime rib, Mexican, seafood - you name it, they have it. As someone who loves seafood, I was in heaven. The salmon, tuna, and red snapper nigiri were all fresh and delicious. The sushi rolls were also a hit, with a decent amount of meat in the crab legs and no fishy smell or taste in the oysters. I also loved trying their juices in cute little bottles, especially the guava and mango flavors.

The desserts here are also top-notch. I highly recommend the chocolate covered strawberries, creme brulee, Italian cookie gelato, and macarons. And speaking of macarons, who else offers that at a buffet? And while there were a few things I didn't like, including the hot and sour soup and the prime rib, overall the quality of the food at this buffet was impressive.

My only complaint would be the price, but that's expected for a buffet on the Vegas strip. And while this buffet may be a bit pricier than others, I can confidently say that it's the best one in Vegas. So if you find yourself in Vegas with time to kill and a serious hunger, definitely check out this buffet. You won't regret it."
1583,"Not open to the public! Only for the employees in the building. Don't trek out here in the snow and be disappointed like I did. \n\nTo be fair, I have no doubt that this place is a four or five star establishment for people in the building!

The service at this establishment was less than satisfactory. My burger was overcooked and tasted like it had been left on the grill for far too long. To add insult to injury, the $9 cocktail I ordered was completely undrinkable. I can only assume that the employees must be miserable in their jobs, as they seemed to emit an aura of dissatisfaction. In fact, I almost witnessed a fight between kitchen staff during my visit.

On the bright side, the decor was rather interesting. However, it wasn't enough to redeem the subpar experience. I can't help but feel like this place is just a rundown version of PT's. Needless to say, I won't be returning anytime soon.

P.S. It's worth noting that the WiFi is free, but don't rely on it if you need to get work done. The spotty internet connection is likely due to the high volume of users in the area. So if you're in desperate need of a stable signal, you might want to look elsewhere."

Summary:
- Location: Lotus of Siam is located in a questionable neighborhood and is difficult to find via cab.
- Decor: The interior is nothing special, but has some traditional Thai touches and newspaper articles boasting the restaurant's reputation.
- Food: Despite the hype and recommendations, the food was average at best and failed to impress. It was a disappointment compared to other Thai restaurants.
- Service: The wait for a cab after our meal was quite long, possibly due to the location.
- Overall: While Lotus of Siam may stand out in Las Vegas, it falls short compared to other Thai restaurants in North America.

Recommendations:
I can't say I would recommend Lotus of Siam for its food or service, but if you're looking for a unique location and decor, this may be the place for you. Just don't have high expectations for the food."

During my recent dining experience at Pig & Pickle, I was excited to try out their dinner menu for the first time. However, my high expectations were quickly dashed when I realized that our server seemed uninterested in serving our table. In fact, they even told us that they were short on time which made us feel neglected and rushed throughout the meal. While the food was decent, it was overshadowed by the poor service. This was definitely not the kind of experience I was hoping for, especially since it was my birthday dinner. I left feeling disappointed and let down by the overall lack of hospitality. Sadly, this was my worst experience at Pig & Pickle to date."
1587,"I ended up here a few weeks ago for a happy hour with some former co-workers.  We arrived at around 5 PM on a Thursday to find the restaurant and bar area fairly open.  The restaurant itself has an impressive locked beer room when entering its space and a dining room on one side of the restaurant and a bar with high top tables on another side.  Since we were only ordering appetizers and drinks, we decided to sit at one of the high tops.  Thankfully we were there during their happy hour and so were able to get half priced Belgian drafts and 50 cent buffalo bites.  Our waitress quickly came over and took our orders and when all was said and done I had tried some mozzarella wedges and buffalo bites as well as a few beers on draft.  The mozzarella wedges were decent but nothing special and I was not a huge fan of the buffalo bites either.  It wasn't that the flavor wasn't good but they seemed to be somewhat overcooked and so not that great.  We also ended up staying past the end of happy hour and so our last beers were what I consider to be extremely overpriced.  Overall it was not a memorable trip to the Bistro.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably be back in the future but not necessarily by my choice.  They easily have the best selection of beer in the city proper and their food is good as well, I only wish that it wasn't so expensive."

The avocado was a key ingredient in that sandwich and without it, my entire meal was ruined. And, to top it off, the delivery guy had no change so I was forced to overpay for my already disappointing meal. Needless to say, this experience at Buffalo WW left a bad taste in my mouth. I've heard great things about their other locations, but this one definitely missed the mark. The service was lacking, the delivery was a disaster, and the sandwich was not worth the price I paid. I would have had a better dining experience spending the same amount of money at a different restaurant. Management really needs to step up their game at this specific location. Until then, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. "

I'm not usually one to complain about a party scene, but this place just didn't do it for me. Sure, there were plenty of attractive people, but the constant thumping music and steep cover charge just didn't make it worth it.

I was excited to take my furry best friend to Cosmo Dog Park for Yappy Hour, but unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. The agility equipment was poorly constructed, the watering areas were dirty, and there was barely enough room for my dog to run and play. And don't even get me started on the tennis balls - they looked like they had been chewed on by every dog in the park. Not to mention, there was dog poop everywhere and hardly anyone bothered to clean it up. My poor pup ended up covered in it by the end of our visit. 

But the worst part was the lack of etiquette from other dog owners. I am all for dogs socializing and having fun, but when parents bring their young children to the dog park, it becomes a disaster. My dog loves other dogs, but not all dogs are kid-friendly. I don't want to worry about my dog accidentally injuring a child or a child provoking my dog. Can we please just leave the kids at home and let our furry companions have their own space?

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Cosmo Dog Park. My dog didn't have nearly as much fun as he would have liked, and I ended up having to give him a bath as soon as we got home. I will definitely not be returning to this poorly managed and overcrowded dog park. Such a shame, because my dog deserves a break from his tough day as my loyal companion, but this place just added to his stress. "

The customer service at this insurance company was lacking to say the least. Despite coming to an agreement with a body shop, they failed to communicate and execute basic tasks. My initial communication with an assigned contact person was efficient, but it quickly became my responsibility to follow up. Apparently, the department head is also the designated contact person, but good luck getting a response from her or her staff. It seems like they are trying to save money on long distance calls by being non-responsive. It took multiple corrections for them to finally use the correct mailing address, and even then, their postage meter was predated by 3 weeks.  
To top it off, they have an interesting convention where the ""print date"" on the check is several days after the ""issue date"". What's even more shocking is that they continued to send a check that was already canceled by them, with no communication to the customer. Unbelievable! 
In my opinion, this experience was worthy of a two-star review, but now I have to give it one star because of their lack of communication and follow-through. It's safe to say, I'll be sticking with my current insurance company, State Farm. "

They put the rubber sole half way up the back of the shoes when they were supposed to put the rubber sole on the BOTTOM of the shoe only.  I can't no longer wear either pair because they look cheap, fake, and ridiculous with a cut off piece of rubber glued to the back of the shoes.  I wouldn't care if this happened to a pair of inexpensive shoes; but I trusted this store with my designer shoes and they did not care for them.

The service at this establishment was utterly disappointing. Despite having heard good things about the food and drinks, my experience was anything but enjoyable. My group and I waited for nearly an hour for our food to arrive, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't even busy. We watched as several other parties were seated, ate, and left before we even received our food. And to add insult to injury, the waitstaff didn't offer anything to make up for our incredibly long wait time. I would have expected some sort of apology or discount, but instead, we were left feeling ignored and unimportant. The food itself was decent, but definitely not worth waiting an hour for. And to top it off, the prices were on the higher side. Maybe the establishment is under new management now, but based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon.

Our experience at Bucca di Beppo was a disappointment from start to finish. Despite the convenient online check-in option, our excitement quickly turned sour upon entering our room. The bathroom reeked of sewage, and the closet door was literally falling off its hinges (see attached picture for proof). To make matters worse, our requests to have the issue addressed were met with half-hearted attempts. Instead of fixing the closet door, a cleaning crew came and doused the room in chemicals to mask the smell. And when we asked for our sheets to be changed due to the chemical smell (I am 7 months pregnant), we were only given two extra pillows with stained covers. The subpar quality of the room and non-existent service left a sour taste in our mouths, especially after spending a pretty penny on just a Caprese Salad and Penne San Remo. As much as we wanted to enjoy our dinner at Bucca di Beppo, we can confidently say there are far better Italian restaurants in the area with better value for your money.

I have to say, I was excited to try this restaurant based on all the hype and glamour surrounding it. However, upon arrival and seeing the grand entrance and beautiful decor, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down by the food. My group was lucky enough to get a table on the top floor of the Palms Fantasy Tower, which was definitely a highlight. But as we perused the menu, I couldn't help but feel disappointed by the options. The soft shell crab dish seemed promising, so I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it ended up being the only thing I enjoyed from my meal. The entrees were lackluster, to say the least. The presentation of the dishes was impressive, but that's about all I can compliment. I hate to say it, but the food was just mediocre. I hate to give a bad review, especially after the excitement and anticipation I had, but I have to be honest. I would give the presentation and ambiance 4 stars, but for the food itself, it's a generous 3-star rating. Sorry, Mr. Malouf.

I had ordered a soup/salad/1/2 sandwich entree for lunch, and he forgot the soup. When he did bring it after being reminded, it was lukewarm. He kept forgetting to bring refills as well. It was like he was in another world. We ended up being comped quite a bit off of our bill because of simple mistakes because what's the point in being served lukewarm soup or an appetizer at the end of your meal? And he was NOT new!

So he finally brings back fresh squeezed and it's a glass about a third the size of of the original.\n\nThe food overall was tasty and hot. No complaints there. Service seems to be on par with the other reviews. Our chucklehead was no exception. When he did bring the bill, it was only a total and no itemized bill. Had to ask for that too. I wonder if he'll figure out he'll save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time?"

As someone who has been to this bar on multiple occasions, I have to say that I have had both positive and negative experiences here. On some visits, the atmosphere was lively and the music was exceptional. However, my most recent visit was a bit of a letdown. First of all, the overpowering smell of vomit that greeted me upon entering was a major turn-off. It was hard to enjoy my drink and engage in conversation with my friends, as my nose was constantly assaulted by the pungent scent. Additionally, the bar was crowded, dark, and dirty, making it even more difficult to fully enjoy my experience. 

One thing that bothered me the most was the lack of attentive service. Maybe it was due to the busy night, but the bartender seemed more focused on talking to their friends than taking care of paying customers. It was frustrating trying to communicate with them, as the loud music made it hard to hear each other and the bartender's disinterest was off-putting. It was a shame because I know this bar has potential and I have had good experiences in the past. 

Overall, I can't say I would recommend this bar to anyone. It was a major disappointment and not a place I would willingly choose to go to again. I hope they can improve on their service and cleanliness in the future, but until then, I will be avoiding this unpleasant experience."
1606," The atmosphere inside was cozy and the staff was friendly and attentive.

I was in search of the perfect egg custard tart and stumbled upon this bakery. My first bite was a disappointment, as the tart shell was not to my liking and the glaze on top was overpowering. However, the custard bun saved the day and made me willing to give this place another chance. The cozy atmosphere and friendly staff added to the overall experience. Despite the lackluster tart, I am willing to try more of their baked goods on my next visit."
1607,"A lot of people I know really go mad for this place - but while I am not as big a chocolate fan as they may be, I really dont see the appeal of this place.\n\nChocolate Soup is basically a cafe that serves all of its dishes with a chocolate infused something or other, or a chocolate coated do-dah. Oh, and you can have a side order of a chocolate muffin and a chocolate latte to drink. You see my point.\n\nThe idea must be a good one however, as this place is always full - and I can see why, the food is actually very very nice, including the actual chocolate soup you can buy. The trouble is that it really is all a bit too much, and I could help but feel a little sick after I left here. The food is just too chocolate-y for my taste.\n\nThe staff werent bad, and to give them thier due, it was a packed weekend lunchtime, so I really couldnt fault them."
1608,"Gotta love Tazza D'Oro.\n\nThis place is by far the best coffee within a ten minute walk of Carnegie Mellon... though that isn't saying much. The wait staff is very friendly and the coffee is A-OK!\n\nOccasionally the coffee has an oiliness to it, which typically means the beans aren't fresh, but overall I'm satisfied. The hot sandwiches and soup are the most edible thing on campus and the pastries are amazing. If the prices were a TINY bit lower I would give the place 4 stars."

Although the room was nice, our overall experience at this hotel was far from satisfactory. We arrived late due to a storm and had to wait in line for 20 minutes just to check in. To our dismay, the elevators were a constant source of frustration throughout our stay. Despite having 5 people at the front desk on a Friday night, we still had to wait at least 15 minutes for an elevator, which were always packed to capacity. This made it extremely difficult to get to and from our room. 

Adding to our disappointment was an encounter with a woman in the mall who offered us a chance to register for a free stay at the hotel as a promotional offer. When we politely declined, as Vegas was not in our travel plans for this year, she became incredibly rude and gave us a disdainful look. It's not our fault that the hotel had poor timing for their promotion. 

The only saving grace was the breakfast at the Cafe, which was fantastic. But unfortunately, it wasn't enough to make up for the lack of efficiency and rude behavior we experienced. This certainly put a damper on our trip and we were left feeling frustrated and disappointed. Perhaps the hotel should prioritize improving their services instead of trying to lure guests with promotions they can't fulfill. It's a shame that this one incident overshadowed the friendly service we received from every other employee at the hotel. In my opinion, the only thing that deserves two stars in this review is the breakfast and the friendly staff, not the overall experience. "
1610,"Now for fast food I must say El Apollo Loco is one of my favorites, but my visit today fell short of expectations,  got the 1/2 chicken combo for $10, but I think the chicken was malnourished, cause it was so small I left hungry.  also had the pinto beans amid broccoli which was tasty.   as for the chicken it was over cooked and dry, such a shame.  I would probably come here more often, but have had same issue before.  this location is the closest to my home and still drive 15+ miles to get my El Apollo loco fix.   glad they are opening a new one in the Goodyear area.  let hope quality/quantity is better.\n\nNow for the service the staff is very friendly and prompt, that is one of the reason I have continued to come back. If this stars were based on service only they would have got 5 stars,  but because of cost vs. quantity I will not go higher.\n\nEl Apollo loco get bigger pieces of chicken, your price of a meal is not on the cheap side so stop getting such small chickens"
1611,"I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and Los Rubios that is right around the corner from my house was closed. So I went here instead. Service was fast, however the burrito was marginal at best. I ordered the 'Breakfast Burrito', which had eggs, ham and pico de gallo. I was try to eat this and drive to work. \n\nBad idea!\n\nI had some 'juice' from within the burrito running down my forearm and onto my jeans. I wasn't happy about this. So I had to fashion the paper bag around the wax paper wrap to catch said 'juice'.\n\nThe only thing from here that I can say has been consistently good would be the super nachos. After I typed the last sentence, I realized, every time I had the super nachos were after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, which could be why it was good."

I went to this dollar store with high hopes after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant. Despite the warm welcome at the door, I quickly realized that the quality of the items did not match the friendly atmosphere.

It all started when I ordered the chicken teriyaki skewers from the food stand at the back of the store. To my dismay, the chicken was all fatty and chewy, making it nearly impossible to enjoy. As I made my way through the meal, I found myself picking out piece after piece of inedible meat until I had a pile of it on my plate. It was such a disappointment.

Things didn't get any better when I browsed through the store. The shelves were disorganized and it was clear that the employees were not as attentive as the previous reviewers had claimed. In fact, I had a hard time finding some of the items I needed and ended up leaving the store empty-handed.

I couldn't help but compare this dollar store to the previous ones I had visited. The one off S Rainbow was much smaller, but it was clean and well-maintained. And the 99 cent store, while not as welcoming, had a wide selection of items at affordable prices. This store, on the other hand, fell short in every aspect.

I was truly disappointed with my experience at this dollar store and I will not be returning. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it did not live up to its reviews. I would not recommend this dollar store to anyone in search of a pleasant shopping experience."
1613,"The last time I played Bingo was when I was a teen in Ohio hanging with my friend and her mom. Her mom had the trolls and lineup of bingo \""cards\"" on newsprint, and bingo markers. She was as serious as the old ladies in the room, but after observing the strange rituals I was bored after a few rounds. \n\nBingo here is a whole new level. The same older players (along with a bunch of younger ones), but a very Vegas experience. \n\nThe bingo caller, or whatever, looked like she was ready for a press conference, with the professional sound equipment.  The numbers appear on electronic boards high on the walls.  \n\nI sat at the bingo machine. You get a packet, enter the number from your receipt, then sit back as the caller calls out everyone's numbers but yours. A young woman won 17,000.00 and another won $1000 or more. There were a smattering of $5 to $15 winners. \n\nI found the process slow and...unengaging? Distant? The machines made me feel useless.  Maybe I'd enjoy using the papers. The setup was uncomfortable, with little knee room, and the caller was slow as molasses, too, and having a single person circle the room to verify all the winners left looooong gaps between some rounds. I'd have to be retired and bored to come here again. It's a cool looking room, though."

I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it fell a little short for me. Don't get me wrong, the food was decent, but it didn't blow me away like I was expecting. To be fair, the service was great and our server was extremely friendly, which definitely added to the overall experience. 

We went on a weeknight and the restaurant was relatively empty, which is always a bit of a red flag for me. However, the pot roast was surprisingly delicious and I highly recommend trying it with the horseradish. But I was disappointed that they had lamb chops on the menu, but no gyro options. I was really craving one and it was a bummer to not have that option. 

The hummus was definitely a standout dish, but unfortunately the pita was very hard. I mentioned it to our server and he quickly brought out a fresh batch for us, which was greatly appreciated. So it seems like they are open to feedback and willing to make changes, which is always a good sign. 

Overall, I think this place has potential to be great once they iron out a few issues in the kitchen. I do want to mention that the prices are very reasonable, with the most expensive item being $18. Definitely a plus for those on a budget. However, with other popular restaurants like Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy nearby, it may be hard to compete. I probably won't be returning anytime soon, but I hope they continue to improve and succeed in the future."
1615,"Las Vegans pass by Terrible Herbst locations every day. But have you ever really taken a look at their stores? From the circa 1980's style lettering on the outside to dull, dingy, boring, cramped, and sometimes downright dirty stores on the inside I wonder how on earth they stay in business? Actually I think they've got it figured it out. They put 2 on each corner along busier streets like a bottom feeder net to try and scoop up any traffic they can get. This location has a twin on the North side of Sunset as proof of concept. Terribles is one of the worst C-stores I've ever stepped foot in and this location in particular is a dump. To get to the gas pumps you get to run the gauntlet of cars leaving Wendys, the car wash, or especially WalMart who cut through the gas pumps like NASCAR cup racers going for the championship. If you do get to a pump the pumps themselves are dirty. The button pads to punch in your credit / debit card info are torn or missing. But while pumping gas you can occasionally get some free entertainment thanks to the Henderson PD busting speeders and illegal U-Turns from the parking lot. \n\nIf you go inside the staff is always nice, but the place is cramped, stacked, and packed so that you get that nice canned sardine feeling. I flat refuse to get a fountain drink here, the self serve options just creep me out. And the bathroom? Ugh, I think I'll skip that part. \n\nIf you just have to stop for gas, or get something to drink it's barely tolerable. But if there's ever a poster child for why Terrible Herbst should invest in some upgrades and maybe some cleaning supplies, this location is it. \n\n2 Stars and that's only because the employees provide good service."

I was looking for a reliable internet provider to stream my favorite shows and movies, so I decided to give this company a try. After reading their advertised rate of $29.99 for internet that was sufficient for streaming, I was excited to finally have an affordable option. However, upon calling to confirm my appointment, I was informed that the actual price would be $34.95. When I expressed my concern to the customer service agent, I was disappointed to hear that they could not honor the price they had initially quoted. As someone who values trust and honesty, I found this to be incredibly frustrating. How can a company expect to retain customers when they don't stand by their word? In the end, I chose to cancel my appointment and find another internet provider who values their customers and their promises. "
1617,"Honey, I shrunk the candy shop!\n\nBack when Smeeks was at Central and Camelback, it offered a large selection of retro candies and unusual handmade candies, along with novelties. The store in The Union at Biltmore is still utterly adorable, but it's less than half the size, and it's more a novelty store than a candy store. It's also probably closer to a 5-star experience on one's very first visit, when the sheer exuberance of the place is delightful.\n\nRetro candies are on the small back wall and include candy bars I don't recall seeing at the candy store on Mill Avenue. Retro is where the action is here, possibly because it goes with the retro charm of many of the novelties.\n\nThere are bins of taffy. There is a wall display of manufactured candies and then the tables have a few artisanal items of the marshmallow, caramel, and candy bark varieties. The suppliers may rotate, as the chi-chi caramels I tried and liked in June did not appear to be the same chi-chi caramels offered in December, though both brands had a spicy chile version (which you, too, should try).\n\nThere's been a good deal of Archie McPhee catalog action to stock the novelty section, including embrace of the current trend for fixating on mustaches. Now that the Green Parrot is a dead parrot, this is the only place I know in Phoenix to buy any frivolities of this ilk, so I wish they'd go for the full McPhee and stock the action figures and bacon products.\n\nIf you think of this as a frivolous little gift shop amidst the high consumerism of Biltmore Fashion Park, it works quite well. If you'd be happy to find any sort of retro candy, it's still #1, thanks to slippage among its rivals. If you're looking for a large variety of candies like the shop used to have, be prepared for a bit of frustration."

I was really excited to try this place after reading such great reviews, and the fact that it was just up the street from my house made it even more convenient. However, my experience ended up being a bit disappointing. 

First of all, there was a 10 minute wait to be seated and then another 10 minutes before my order was even taken. I saw that most of the guests were already served, while I was still waiting for my food. I couldn't help but notice that the restaurant seemed a bit disorganized and chaotic. 

But I was determined to wait it out for Chef Mark's famous food, and I decided to order the Neptune Eggs Benedict with fresh lump crab meat as well as a side of home fries and a half order of French toast. I was really hungry, so I also added on some sausage. 

Finally, after a long 50 minute wait, my food arrived. The Neptune Eggs Benedict were definitely the highlight of my meal - the hollandaise sauce was homemade and absolutely delicious. The sausage were also good, but the French toast was just average. And the home fries seemed a little undercooked to me. 

What really took away from my dining experience was the long wait and the lack of ambiance. The restaurant was crowded and noisy, and it was hard to have a conversation without hearing other people's conversations. But I will say that the staff was very friendly and accommodating. 

All in all, my meal was decent but not mind-blowing. Maybe if I had come on a less busy day, my experience would have been better. But for now, I'll give it a solid 3 stars."
1619,"Disclaimer: I'm from Vancouver and have not been immersed in Mexican food my entire life. But, I do know good food from bad food, and our last meal was not good food.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian quesadillas. On the menu, it states they are grilled vegetable quesadillas. I love smoky grilled veg and was really excited for my meal. \n\nYeah... they weren't grilled. They took a cheap, mixed bag of generic veg (carrots and celery, REALLY?), sauteed them in some butter, and popped them on a tortilla with cheap, nasty cheese. They didn't even cut them all the way through.\n\nService was good once our server got to us. We were left at our table for a solid 10 minutes before our server came by to grab drink orders and bring chips and salsa. I like the patio with the water feature out back.\n\nOverall, disappointing experience that doesn't warrant a return visit."

The service at this pizza place was absolutely disappointing. Our group of 9 was instructed by the cashier to place our orders at the pizza counter. However, after standing there for what felt like an eternity, we were completely ignored and had to flag down another staff member to take our order. It was chaos and caused a lot of confusion for everyone involved.

And to make matters worse, the food was not up to par. The pizza was overly salty, making it almost unbearable to eat. The garlic bread was decent, but the marinara sauce that came with it tasted like a bottle of pure salt. It was a huge disappointment and definitely did not live up to our expectations.

In addition, the wait time was all over the place. While we were hoping for a quick grab-and-go meal, the inconsistent wait times made it clear that this is not a reliable option for a time crunch.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, even if you're desperate for a quick bite. The poor service and below-average food just isn't worth it. It's a shame, because with some improvements in both areas, this place could have potential. But for now, it's not worth the hassle. "

I had high hopes for this restaurant after hearing rave reviews from friends and seeing their tempting menu. But my experience was far from satisfying.

First of all, the wait time was ridiculous. I was promised a 20-25 minute wait on their paging system, but ended up standing in line for almost an hour. And to make matters worse, I noticed three other couples who were behind me in line, get seated before me. When I finally brought it up to the hostess, she seemed unbothered and gave me some excuse about delays. It's called a paging system for a reason, people!

To top it off, the service was incredibly slow. Our server seemed more interested in chatting with her regular customers than attending to us. After finally getting her attention, we waited forever for our food to arrive. And while I will admit that the portions were generous, the taste was nothing special. Honestly, I've had better food from a drive-thru.

The only redeeming factor was that the dishes were at least fresh and well-prepared. But let's be real, a good meal should not be the only thing a restaurant has going for it.

Based on my experience, I would only recommend this place for takeout orders. Don't waste your time or money on the disappointing service and mediocre food. Trust me, there are plenty of other options out there."
1622,"Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. \n\nTime has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. \n\nThen come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. \n\nAfter a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. \n\nMeanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.\n\nIm sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame."
1623,"OK, if you want a new experience on the great hamburger, this is a very cool place to try for sure.  Gourmet burgers with an Asian Flair, great fries with a different twist.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Very nice in a small tucked away corner in a non discript dopey strip mall that really has nothing to offer other than this place.  Kind of out of the way actually.  Has a small feeling but nice and warm overall.\n\n2.  Service -  Had a young/ new server, but he seemed to know his stuff. Clearly the place is very proud of their vision and their offerings. I would be too.  However, they were closed on Valentines for reservations only dinners, which is ODD for a place that does NOT take reservations. Then, on Presidents day, they decided to open on the Monday, which is normally a closed day for them and then they closed on Tuesday. Twice I went there and they were closed. I consider this a bit arrogant, but they can be for sure!!!\n\n3.  Food - Wow, very tasty and the asian fusion is really cool and nice. Tastes are very good.You can even do without the bun and still the taste rocks.  Ronin Burger, Kiki Burger, Kalbi Burger,, all great. The non traditional ice teas are a bit \""much\"" meaning, that they have a strong and odd taste compared to norm. Desserts are great and find out the specials of the day before you order your main dish, to resever whatever is the special.  Oh yeah, all the fries were great.  \n\n4.  Price -  For six of us with three desserts, the total came out to $120.00. I find that a bit steep for a gourmet burger and even though the kids enjoyed the taste, it was the most awesome thing for their palates.\n\n5.  Overall - this is an experience and you need to try this place for sure, however, it is not a place I am going to pop into all the time. Why?  A bit expensive, a bit pretentious, but still a quality establishment regardless!  \n\nI will go back, but after I save some money!"

My friends and I were excited to check out this place during our trip to Nevada, but our experience was extremely disappointing. We wanted to try some of their famous nachos and have a few beers for happy hour. However, the nachos were a disgrace - there were hardly any chicken pieces and they were smothered in cheese sauce. Talk about a letdown. And to make matters worse, the temperature inside was unbearable because they decided to open the garage doors at 6:00. When we brought this up to the manager, he brushed us off with a nonchalant attitude. It's clear that customer satisfaction is not a priority for this place. We were so disappointed and will never be returning."
1625,"If you're looking for bang for your buck and by that I mean HUGE portions, this is a quality place to eat.  While there are definitely other places on the strip with higher quality, more flavorful food, most of them aren't offering portions this size.\n\nI had  the Sage Fried Chicken and a Bloody Mary.  The Bloody Mary was the first one I've ever tried and it was delicious.  Peppery, with the perfect amount of Vodka mixed in.  The fried chicken was average and the bacon waffle was a little disappointing.  They basically throw a bunch of full pieces of bacon into the batter, throw it in the waffle iron and call them bacon waffles.  Good try, but the waffles just didn't have the flavor that I was looking for.\n\nIt wasn't a bad meal by any means though.  For the price, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and I wouldn't be against coming back to this place next time I'm in Vegas."

I have to say, my experience at Simply School Uniforms was a complete 180 from my last visit. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the exceptional customer service this time around. They went above and beyond to make sure I had a positive experience and to rectify any previous issues I had. 

The staff was incredibly knowledgeable about all the different uniform requirements for different schools, and they even gave me some great tips and advice as a newbie to the world of school uniforms. I left feeling confident and satisfied with my purchases. 

I have to give a special shoutout to Damien and his team for their hard work and dedication to providing great customer service. It truly made a difference and I will definitely be returning to Simply School Uniforms for all my future uniform needs. Keep up the great work!"

I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, it fell flat. Don't be fooled by the positive reviews, because my experience here was anything but enjoyable. The old and run down atmosphere was a major turn off, and I couldn't help but feel like I was in a time warp. As for the food, I have to admit, the salsa was pretty tasty, but everything else was just mediocre. I didn't see any roaches like some other reviewers have claimed, but that's not saying much when the overall quality is lacking. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but I can say with certainty that I won't be returning to this ""family style"" restaurant anytime soon. Save your money and check out one of the many other places in town that actually care about their customers and providing a quality dining experience."

We were not informed that we would hear pneumatic drills and jackhammers not only in our room, but in the hallways it's SO loud people are walking covering their ears!  We were put in one of the updated rooms that will be Delano, we hated it.  We come to Vegas to relax and loved the dark, romantic setting that THE Hotel had offered, now it's white on white Miami style...not very relaxing.  We were also promised a pool view, we got no pool view but a rooftop and a parking lot.  We asked to be moved to THE Hotel...not Delano..which they did and we got a strip view which was better.  THE Hotel does definitely need to be updated, just not to the contemporary modern Miami white.  We will be staying somewhere else next time.  I hear the jackhammer in my room as I'm writing this. Hotels should be required to disclose that they are under construction, or will be at the time of your stay!"

I was lucky enough to see Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour at this venue and I have to say, it was an unforgettable experience. From the moment he stepped on stage, I was entranced by his incredible performance. The set design was stunning, with vibrant colors and visuals that added to the overall atmosphere of the show. It was refreshing to see him in a smaller venue, which made the concert feel more intimate. Even though he couldn't possibly sing every single one of his hits, I was overjoyed to hear some of my all-time favorites like ""Tiny Dancer"" and ""Your Song"" live. I highly recommend checking out this concert if you have the chance. While I had an amazing time, I will say that the ticket prices were a little steep and the crowds were pretty intense, so be prepared for that.

I have to say, I'm usually a big fan of PF Changs, but my recent visit was a bit underwhelming. The food was just okay, nothing to write home about. My friends who ordered meat dishes were especially disappointed, saying they've had better pan Asian cuisine elsewhere.

Our waitress, however, was a shining star. She was funny and very attentive, making great recommendations for cocktails. I couldn't get enough of the Coconut Lemon Sour she suggested. It was the perfect blend of flavors and wasn't too sweet. I rarely crave cocktails, but this one will definitely be on my mind.

The saving grace for me was the vegetarian options. As a vegetarian, I struggle to find tasty tofu at restaurants. But PF Changs surprised me with their delicious Ma Po Tofu and flavorful vegetable side dishes. It's enough to make me want to come back, despite the lackluster meat dishes.

Overall, I would recommend this place to my vegetarian friends, but for my meat-eating friends, I'd suggest trying a different pan Asian restaurant with more tasty meat options."

I visited this place with high hopes, after hearing great things from friends and seeing the hype on social media. However, my experience was far from satisfactory. First of all, we had to wait 30 minutes just to get a seat, even though it was a Wednesday morning at 10:00AM. And let me tell you, the wait was not worth it. The service at the bar was painfully slow and it took forever to even get our drinks. Speaking of drinks, I ordered their signature Morning Dew cocktail, which was supposed to have all these fancy ingredients. But let me tell you, it was a complete disappointment. Not a single bubble in sight, and the drink was warm and lacked any real flavor. 

To make matters worse, the food was mediocre at best. We waited another 20 minutes for our dishes, and they were nothing special. The only decent thing we tried was the Corned Beef Hash, but everything else was just bland and unimpressive. I was especially disappointed with the Bella! Bella! Benny, which was supposed to be a standout dish. The flavor was totally lackluster and even the house hash browns were a letdown. And don't even get me started on the Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes that the bartender recommended. They were a complete letdown, and I'm pretty sure they were undercooked. 

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this supposedly popular and highly-rated breakfast/lunch spot. The food was nothing special, the service was subpar, and I just don't understand the hype at all. Maybe if you're a regular here, you'll get better treatment, but as a new guest, I was not impressed at all. Save your money and go somewhere else for a good meal. Trust me, there are plenty of better options out there. "

After hearing so much about Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill, my husband and I finally decided to give it a try during our trip to Vegas. I have to admit, I was pretty excited to try out his famous dishes. Unfortunately, I left feeling underwhelmed. 
To start, the waiter recommended the Yucatan Chicken Skewers as an appetizer, and while they were okay, it wasn't anything special. For our entrees, I ordered the MANGO + SPICE CRUSTED TUNA STEAK and my husband ordered the CASCABEL CHILE CRUSTED RABBIT. I specifically asked for my tuna to be cooked medium, but when it arrived, it was well done and lacking any flavor. The rabbit was decent, according to my husband, but nothing to rave about. 
The only highlight of the meal was the Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Pomegranates + Toasted Walnuts, which we had seen other couples order as well. But overall, for the price we paid and with so many other dining options in Vegas, it just wasn't worth it for us. Maybe if we had more time to try different dishes, we would have had a better experience, but unfortunately, we were left disappointed. I'll stick to watching Bobby Flay on TV instead of visiting his restaurant again."

I recently stayed at this hotel and was not impressed with the accommodations. The rooms were nothing special and left a lot to be desired. The pillows were flat and uncomfortable, and the bathroom was less than ideal. The toilet was a bit scary to use and the sink was so small that I couldn't even wash my face without splashing water everywhere. And to make matters worse, the towels had a strange burnt smell to them. I can only assume it was from being placed too close to the heating vent.  Overall, not the kind of experience I was hoping for. While the overall ambiance of the hotel was pleasant, the room itself was a major letdown. I've definitely stayed in better hotels for the same price. "
1634,"I build my own stir-fry and I had the veggies with noodles.  The service is quick and the staff are very friendly. I had left overs and I had it to go. Make sure to ask for a bag to place your to-go box, because the sauce from your food will leak and you don't want to wear it on your shirt or spill all over your car. \n\nNice place to eat Chinese food!"

During my recent visit to this restaurant, I was hopeful to have a good meal with my friends. Unfortunately, our experience was far from satisfactory. The menu had very limited options, which was quite disappointing. Our waiter seemed knowledgeable at first, but after taking our order, we barely saw him again. The service was slow and lacking attention.

When our food finally arrived, it was a disappointment. My tacos were supposed to come on flour tortillas, but instead, they came on corn tortillas. The flavors were bland and unimpressive. It was not the flavorful meal I was hoping for. Additionally, the portion size was smaller than expected, considering the price we paid for it.

One of my friends ordered the 'American Kobe beef' burger, which came out over-seasoned. That was a major let down, especially for the price we paid. The sides we ordered were also not up to par. The sweet potato fries were over-seasoned, and we ended up having to scrape off most of the seasoning before eating them. The onion rings were salty, a strange and unpleasant surprise.

The only saving grace of our meal was the chocolate milkshake. It was creamy and delicious, just as a milkshake should be. But unfortunately, one good item was not enough to redeem our overall experience.

To make matters worse, the service was subpar. We waited 5-10 minutes before our waitress noticed us, and even then, she seemed disinterested. Our food took over 30 minutes to arrive, and our waitress only came back to check on us when it was time for us to cash out. The whole experience left us feeling disappointed and unimpressed.

Based on our experience, I would not recommend this restaurant. The limited menu, bland food, and poor service make it an overall unappealing option. The prices are also quite high for what you receive. Save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere for a satisfying meal."

I was pleasantly surprised when I first walked into this Thai Basil. It was a busy Friday night and the place was packed, but luckily we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The atmosphere was lively and the smell of the food was already making my mouth water. \n\nWe were seated right away and our server, a friendly woman named Lisa, welcomed us and handed us the menus. As someone who has a gluten intolerance, I was relieved to see that they had a separate section for gluten-free options. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, my partner and I decided on the Larb, Beef Pad Thai, and Yellow Curry Chicken. We consider ourselves Thai food experts, so we had high hopes for these classic dishes. \n\nThe Larb arrived in no time and it was delicious. The meat was perfectly seasoned with a perfect balance of sweet and savory. However, as the intention review points out, there was definitely an overflow of lettuce compared to the amount of meat. It didn't take away from the flavor, but it did leave us wishing for more meat. \n\nOur main dishes arrived shortly after and unfortunately, we were a bit disappointed. The Yellow Curry Chicken had amazing flavor, but there was only a small amount of chicken in the dish. The same can be said for the Beef Pad Thai, which had a generous portion of noodles but lacked the beef we were hoping for. We couldn't help but wonder if they were trying to cut costs. \n\nDespite the lack of protein in our main dishes, Lisa's friendly service and the flavorful Larb still made our dining experience enjoyable. If it weren't for the skimping on ingredients, this place would easily receive five stars from us. We'll just have to come back and try some of their other dishes to see if the portion sizes improve."

I was hesitant to try out Tryst for the first time, even though I had heard so many great things about it. But let me tell you, it definitely lived up to the hype. I've been to some of the other popular clubs in the area, like Tao and Ghost Bar, but Tryst blew them out of the water in terms of atmosphere, music, and even the guy to girl ratio. The door guys were also surprisingly cool and welcoming. The only downside is that the drinks are a bit on the pricey side, with mixed drinks costing around $15. But, as they say, you get what you pay for and in this case, I was more than satisfied with my experience. Make sure to arrive early, around 9:30 or 10, if you want to get in without any trouble. And from what I know, there's no guest list, but I was lucky enough to talk to the VIP host and he let me and a female friend in. Overall, Tryst definitely exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend checking it out."

I wanted to love this place, I really did. But after my recent visit, I can confidently say that this location is not up to par with the other ones I've been to. First of all, the layout is just awful. I felt like I was navigating through a maze of stairs and tables just to get to the dance floor. And once I finally made it, it was so dark that I could barely see anyone around me. And don't even get me started on trying to mingle with strangers - good luck with that when you're practically tripping over people and bumping into tables. Oh, and the door staff - talk about a mess. Not only did they have some girl with a major attitude managing the guestlist line, but they also seemed to prioritize those with tables over anyone else. Thankfully, we were able to get into the club with the help of one of the marketing guys, but even then it wasn't worth the hassle. Trust me, there are plenty of other clubs in Vegas that are far better than this one. In fact, we ended up going to Tao instead, where we didn't have to wait in line and were even given a table. Stick to the other locations of this chain and avoid this one at all costs."

As someone who works in the service industry myself, I couldn't believe the lack of effort put into the service here. It wasn't even a busy night, yet the staff seemed too bothered to even acknowledge our presence. The bartender in particular was terrible, with a sour attitude that made me question why he even chose to work here. It took an excruciatingly long 20 minutes for him to even take our drink orders, and don't even get me started on how long it took to receive our check.

It's a shame, because the food was actually not half bad. However, the poor service overshadowed any good that could have come from our meal. Maybe it was just an off night, but based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this place. The Light group should really reconsider their investment in this establishment, as it seems to be heading towards a dark future."
1640,"After all the Obama hype, we thought we'd try DeMarco's.  I drove 20 minutes to get there from Northwest LV.  That's OK, I knew it would be a drive.  I ordered a large pepperoni to go.  When I arrived, they gave me a pizza with all sorts of veggies on it.  Not a pepperoni in sight.  I said that's not what I ordered.  The girl sort of argued with me saying she didn't take the order but that this was a New York pizza.  I said I didn't care who took the order or what you called it, this wasn't a pepperoni pizza.  She went away, came back and said it would be a few minutes.  OK, mistakes happen.  They were playing \""Dark Side of the Moon\"" so they got exact points from me!  While I waited, several people got pizzas to go.  The girl at the front opened each box and showed them their pizzas.  Each one had a black, burned-beyond-belief crust.  Everyone said, \""Great, thanks!\""  and left with their pies.  I couldn't believe it.  So I was ready when they brought mine out.  I guess since they \""rushed\"" mine out, it didn't have time to be burned.  It tasted just OK, but way overpriced at $20 for a single topping.  Don't think I'll go back."
1641,"We went here recently right before a 2-day, 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load. The food was okay - probably what we should have expected for the low prices - but the service was horrible. It was not busy, but we could not get our waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed a refill and asked for one when she took our dinner order, and reminded her when our dinner arrived. We were finally able to flag her down 10 minutes later to remind her again. It also took about 20 minutes to get the check after we had FINISHED our entrees. I am sure that not all of the servers are that bad, but I'm not sure I will be back to find out."

My family and I recently stayed at this La Quinta location and unfortunately, it was not up to par with our expectations. As loyal pizza lovers, we were excited to try Toppers for the first time but were met with disappointment. The small 9 inch pizzas we ordered were just average and lacked the wow factor we were hoping for. Surprisingly, it took us three days to finish the leftovers and even then, we only managed to do so with some encouragement. The pizza was forgettable and not worth the price or the calories.

Similarly, our stay at this La Quinta was also subpar. While the staff were friendly and accommodating, the condition of the hotel itself was disappointing. The bathroom was falling apart and the rugs were heavily stained, giving off an overall unclean and outdated vibe. It was clear that this location was in desperate need of a renovation, especially when compared to other La Quintas we have stayed at. The price was affordable, but we would have been willing to pay more for a higher quality experience.

One redeeming aspect of our stay was the complimentary Wifi, but unfortunately, it was painfully slow. So much so, that we were unable to stream our favorite shows and had to settle for buffering and lagging. It was frustrating and definitely dampened our overall experience.

In conclusion, while the staff and price were satisfactory, the outdated and unclean state of the hotel left much to be desired. Until renovations are made, we will be choosing other pet-friendly options for our future travels."
1643,"Having been to Samba a number of times since discovering it only a month or so ago, I can say it is one of my favorite places to eat in all of Madison if you are in a mood for unlimited food! Over time [as of 2014 now] the quality seems to have gone down in the food but the overall atmosphere and service is great.\n\nThe beginning salad bar is fantastic, you have to try the potatoes to start.  After the salad bar you are served all the meat you can eat, which in my opinion more than makes up for the price.  I honestly think that everyone should give Samba a try if they are in Madison at anytime just for the grilled pineapple and tapioca rolls!  If you have a large appetite there is no reason why you haven't had Samba yet."

My husband and I have a boat docked near this restaurant and have tried it out multiple times. Unfortunately, we always find ourselves wondering why we bother coming back. The view of the lake is lovely, but that's about the only positive aspect of our experiences here.

First and foremost, the service is absolutely abysmal. Every time we walk in, we're met with staff who avoid making eye contact and seem to go out of their way to ignore us. Even after being seated, we're left waiting for our server to come take our order. One time, we were completely brushed off by the manager when we asked for coffee. It's incredibly frustrating and it's a miracle if we ever receive decent service.

The food itself is decent, but definitely not worth the trouble we go through to get a meal here. It's definitely a step up from your average chain restaurant food, but it's nothing to write home about. The homey atmosphere is nice, but it's overshadowed by the lackluster service.

Overall, we'll probably continue to come back for the occasional meal, but only because there aren't many options on the waterfront. If this place had better management and improved service, it could easily be a 4-star restaurant. Until then, it's just not worth the hassle. "

This is some strange cross between Mardi Gras and Spring Break in the middle of nowhere in the desert, the only problem is tents don't leave much to the imagination... It was entertaining for sure!  Our camping neighbors were awesome and it was a very communal atmosphere!  I am not sure what I think about limited shower access around dust, sweat, and tons of people...  Oh and there was some great country music!  I have a whole new respect for Toby Keith; he knows how to have a party.  I would say I broke in my boots dancing and had a blast with my girlfriends!

The bar at this place may have a cool atmosphere, but don't let that fool you. My husband and I were disappointed to find out that their signature long island iced teas were anything but strong. We both had two drinks each and still didn't feel even a slight buzz. And to make matters worse, the food was below average. I ordered the shrimp tacos and my husband had the southwestern chicken fajitas. Both dishes lacked flavor and left us feeling unsatisfied. The only saving grace were the drinks for beer and wine drinkers - we heard those were decent. But for those looking for a stronger drink and decent food, I would not recommend this place."

I recently ordered from this establishment with high hopes after seeing their pizza deal advertised. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. My group of friends and I were expecting a trip down memory lane, but instead, we were left feeling disappointed and longing for our previous visits that had been so enjoyable. The pizza lacked any sort of flavor and tasted as if it had been sitting out for hours. Even the toppings couldn't save the cardboard-like crust. As for the wings, they were mediocre at best. I couldn't help but think that I could get better ones at the Philly joint down the street. And let's not forget the pricing - outrageous. As someone who considers themselves a foodie and knows the importance of good service, amazing food, and reasonable prices, I can confidently say that this place falls short in all three areas. I wish I had asked for a refund or something because we definitely did not get what we paid for. I hate to leave a negative review, but it's important for me to warn others. Save your money and find a better spot to satisfy your pizza cravings. This place is just not worth it."

I was really looking forward to picking up my dry cleaning from this place, as I had heard great things from friends and other reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was far from satisfactory. When I arrived to pick up my order, they had ""lost"" my favorite pair of pants. After some back and forth, they finally ""found"" them but now they expect me to pay again. It's a shame that after being a loyal customer and bringing them my business, their ""miscounting"" has caused me to pay twice for one order. 

To make matters worse, another pair of pants I dropped off were mysteriously ""held up"" and not available for pick up for two days. Did they miss their flight or something? Whatever the reason, I didn't appreciate waiting an extra two days for my clothes. It's unfortunate that my experience did not live up to the previous positive reviews. I wish my service had been as good as those reviewers claimed. Perhaps it was just an off day for them, but with so many other dry cleaning options, I would recommend going somewhere else."
1650,"I'm SO SO SO  tired of seeing expired food on their shelves. \n\nWas in here on Friday evening to get some ground turkey, they had several packages of ground turkey that had expired 3 DAYS prior.

Told him about the expired meat on the shelves and his response was to tell me that employees check the dates everyday so there couldn't possibly be old meat on the shelf. I insisted there were several packages of old meat on the shelf and he just replied \""Well, we'll get it removed\"" and then walked back to the lotto counter. He never called anyone up to remove it, never got on the phone to ask someone in the back to do it, just continued to stand at the counter. \n\nWhen I shop, I like to get FRESH meat to feed my family.

I came here with a group of friends looking for a fun night out, and while the service and drink prices were great, the rest of my experience fell flat. We ordered three drinks for a total of $10, which was a steal, but when it came to ordering food, the prices were a bit outrageous. We ended up spending $75 on just wings, a burger, onion rings, and sweet potato fries. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but for bar food, it was definitely overpriced. We could have gone to another bar down the street and gotten a similar order for half the price. The real issue here is your food pricing - this is a bar, not a fancy restaurant. And it was clear from the amount of empty seats that others felt the same way. For a more enjoyable night, I'd suggest reevaluating your pricing and considering the fact that people come to a bar for a good time, not to break the bank on mediocre food. "

I stopped by this place for lunch the other day with the intention of getting my go-to Chinese food craving fix. I saw they had a delivery option with a low minimum order of $12.00 and I was sold. I ordered a variety of items, including a spring roll, wonton soup, chicken fried rice, and beef with broccoli. They said it would take 40 minutes, but to my surprise, my order arrived in just 35 minutes and everything was still warm.

The egg roll and wonton soup were delicious and exactly what I needed for my cold. The chicken fried rice was decent, but I wished there were more vegetables and egg in it. I also noticed a few questionable pieces of chicken in there. However, the beef with broccoli was a standout dish. The broccoli was fresh and cooked perfectly in a delicious brown sauce. I loved pouring the extra sauce over my rice, it added great flavor.

Overall, the food was decent, but it didn't blow me away. I'll definitely be ordering from here again, especially for the beef with broccoli. The only downside was that the portions were a bit small, I wished there was just a little more. But for the price, it's hard to complain. The best part? I was able to satisfy my craving without having to put in any effort! "

The buffet is just kinda gross.  They advertise a fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays, but I don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry.  It's just kinda gross.  The fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right.  The lasagna was good, but not worth revisiting this place for.  I also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok, but may have given me the shits), fried shrimp (bleh), fried chicken (ok), their soups (weren't very good), chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting), rice pudding (barely ok),  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit).\n\nOh, and not a fan of their salad bar either really.  Sorry Deer Valley Airport restaurant (although really I think you should be apologizing to me), but I'll never be coming back."

I recently had the chance to try out the Wicked Spoon and let me tell you, I have mixed feelings about it. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed after my meal. Let me explain. 

First of all, the atmosphere and service were great. Our group was seated quickly and our server was very attentive and friendly. However, I have to say that I was expecting more of a bar vibe, but it turned out to be more of a family restaurant. Not necessarily a bad thing, just not what I was expecting.

Now, onto the food. The 18 ounce beers in goblets were a hit, and the onion rings were tasty. But I have to say, the options on tap were a bit limited. The highlight of the meal was definitely the build-your-own-burger. It was pretty awesome to create my own burger exactly the way I wanted it. However, after dinner, I couldn't help but feel like we were ready to move on to a bar for the rest of the night.

Overall, the Wicked Spoon was decent. But after paying around $40 for the buffet, I couldn't help but compare it to a cheaper buffet I had the day before. And I have to say, the quality just wasn't there. Don't get me wrong, the prime rib and pork loin were tasty. But the crab legs were a bit on the thin side and the dessert options were lacking. 

All in all, I probably wouldn't go back to the Wicked Spoon. For the price, I was expecting a bit more variety and higher quality. But hey, as they say, you get what you pay for. If you're not looking for a gourmet experience and are just in the mood for some decent food, then this place might be for you. But personally, I'll stick to the cheaper buffets for now."

I waited a good fifteen minutes before brining me my check and when I didn't tip him for his lousy service, he actually threatened me.  I've reported this incident a few times to the Omni Hotel and to the corporate website.  \n\nBottom line: Avoid this place at all costs.  The Terrace Room has the most rude waitstaff ever!!"

2. Not only did they mess up my order, but they also tried to blame me for their mistake. Talk about terrible customer service. 
3. When the pizzas finally arrived, they were cold and unappetizing. The toppings were sparse and obviously a way for them to save money. 
4. But the worst part was the taste. I never thought I would say this, but I would have rather eaten a frozen pizza. 
5. And don't even get me started on the rude and unhelpful manager. We called to complain and all we got was attitude.

I stumbled upon St. James Place last weekend, after a long night of bar-hopping in the city. Needless to say, I was in desperate need of some comfort food. So, I decided to hit up the Terrace Pointe Cafe for some good ol' eggs benedict. The service was exceptional- the staff was friendly and accommodating, just what I needed to cure my hangover. However, the food itself was a little underwhelming. The sauce was just alright, the poached eggs could've used some more flavor, and the muffin was slightly burnt. The potatoes were the highlight, though not the star of the show. They seemed like they were trying too hard to impress, but in the end, failed to leave a lasting impression. Overall, if you're looking for a solid breakfast spot in the Wynn Hotel and aren't afraid of some mediocre food, then Terrace Pointe Cafe may suffice. But, if you're like me and expect more bang for your buck, you might be better off hitting up the old faithful Grand Slam breakfast. Either way, the friendly service and congenial atmosphere made up for the lackluster food. So, while I may not rush back for another meal at Terrace Pointe Cafe, I definitely won't be saying goodbye to St. James Place anytime soon."

I will post a pick of the bag of chips an 2hours later. i love homemade chips but they need to lay these out in a draining bin before they bag them. Very disappointing.

I was feeling adventurous and decided to stop by this amusement park, ready to try out all the thrilling rides they had to offer. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. From the moment I stepped foot into the park, I could tell that it was in desperate need of some updating. The rides were old and rickety, making me hold on for dear life as I hoped to not get a concussion. The Canyon Blaster ride, in particular, was a major letdown. It was so short that I was actually grateful it didn't last any longer, considering how unsafe it felt. And don't even get me started on the Inverter. That ride was just plain terrible. I walked away feeling nauseous and regretting my decision to ever visit this park. I mean, who enjoys feeling like they're going to get sick every time they think about a certain ride? Trust me, I won't be coming back to this amusement park anytime soon."

I was in need of a car and decided to give this dealership a chance, despite seeing some mixed reviews online. I was immediately greeted by Nick Taylor, who seemed friendly and helpful. He assured me that I was pre-approved for financing and even had a bank ready to go for me. Excited, I went through all the paperwork and drove off the lot with my new car.

However, my excitement quickly turned into disappointment when I received a call just a little over a week later, saying that I needed to return the car because they didn't actually have a bank to finance me. I was shocked and frustrated - how could they have told me one thing and then do another? It was clear that they didn't follow through with what they promised, and their lack of professionalism and integrity left a bad taste in my mouth.

To make matters worse, Nick, who was so eager to make a sale before, completely disappeared and stopped returning my calls. It's sad to see that the pursuit of a sale is more important to him than keeping his word and providing good customer service. This whole experience has definitely given salesmen a bad name in my mind.

In summary, while the dealership itself may have some good qualities, my experience with Nick and the lack of follow-through on their promises has left me disappointed. This is definitely not the kind of service you would expect from a car dealership. I may consider giving them another chance in the future, but for now, I would recommend looking elsewhere for a car."

While waiting for my haircut, I stumbled upon this hidden gem right next door. The staff was incredibly welcoming and helpful, especially when they realized it was my first time there. One of the girls took the time to walk me through the menu and explain how everything worked, saving me from hours of confusion. I ended up trying the philly cheesesteak, highly recommended by the staff. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The flavors were on point and the quality of ingredients was top-notch. But I did feel like I was paying a little more than I normally would for a sandwich, as the combo set me back 12 dollars. But hey, sometimes you have to splurge for a good meal. Overall, a solid option for a quick and tasty bite."
1670,"'s experience at House of Window Coverings was not as great as ours. They were disappointed with the quality of their window treatments and felt that the service was lacking. They had to wait longer than expected for installation and the communication from the company was not very good. They even encountered some issues with the fabrics they selected, leading to a less than perfect end result. While we were happy with our experience, we can understand why Don and Melissa were not as satisfied. The showroom may have been impressive, but it seems like their overall experience did not meet their expectations.

We recently visited House of Window Coverings based on the recommendation of some friends who had a great experience there. Unfortunately, our experience was not as positive. While the showroom was impressive and our designer, Jan Rohl, was helpful in selecting styles and fabrics, we encountered some issues during and after installation.

First, we had to wait longer than expected for our window treatments to be installed, causing some inconvenience. Secondly, there were communication issues with the company, which made the process more frustrating than it needed to be. And finally, we were disappointed with the quality of the fabrics we selected. They did not hold up as well as we had hoped and the overall end result was not what we were expecting.

While our friends had a great experience with House of Window Coverings, we unfortunately cannot say the same. We were underwhelmed by the service and quality of our window treatments. While we appreciate the impressive showroom and the time our designer spent with us, we will not be returning to House of Window Coverings for any future projects."
1671,"We were very excited when we saw this establishment had new ownership.  The location is fantastic and the restaurant is clean; however, we will not be back for several reasons.  First, they need to seriously work on the menu.  It is not very expansive and I have not been excited about any items I ordered (out of three visits).  In addition, I was hoping the draught beer selection would be better.  Due to food and beer selection, I will be spending my money up the street at Temple Bar."
1672,"If you genuinely care about the well being of your animal companion, do not take them here. It's unfortunate that this is the 24/7 clinic that is closest to me, but they have have no idea what they are doing. I brought my dog in for surgery on the same wound twice because of their mistakes and they flat out told me they don't know what to do, printed out my records for me and reccomend I visit another vet. The lack of\nintelligence in their profession is embarrassing and I am very upset with them doing work on my dog and finding out they had no idea what they were doing the whole time. Disgusting."

This place is a prime example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" The outside may look fancy and upscale, but the experience inside was just meh. The Asian decor and high ceilings may give off a luxurious vibe, but the overall atmosphere falls short of expectations.

I was excited to check out the dance floor, but unfortunately, it was small and cramped. As expected, it quickly became packed with people, making it difficult to bust a move without constantly bumping into others. And when I finally found a spot, I couldn't even enjoy myself because I was constantly being pushed and shoved by the crowd.

There was a separate hip hop room, but it was pretty much a ghost town. It felt like I was back at a high school dance, awkwardly trying to find a place to fit in. I even debated whether to stay in the boring hip hop room or brave the chaos in the main room. In the end, I ended up leaving to find a better place to party.

The one redeeming factor was the open bar for ladies for an hour. But even that couldn't make up for the lackluster experience. Overall, this place may have potential, but for now, I'll be looking for somewhere else to let loose. "
1674,"I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \n\nFood: \n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\n\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. \n\nWill I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first."
1675,"I stayed at the Green Valley recently for a work trip.  Overall, it was a nice stay -- the place is enormous, staff were all friendly, room was large and clean, and the District next door has some great restaurants to choose from if you don't want to eat in the hotel.\n\nMinor annoyances: the internet connection in the room was spotty, and the gym doesn't open until 6am (my body clock was on East coast time and I really would have liked to get in there earlier).\n\nMy biggest takeaway is that this resort isn't sure what it wants to be, and who they want to cater to.  The decor of the hotel and casino reminded me of a Tuscan style -- lots of tan tile and stone, wrought iron, etc - which appeals to a much older crowd as evidenced by the large number of retirees in the casino.  But the pool area is the opposite -- sleek, modern, hip, full of 20-somethings getting drunk and tan.  It made me laugh to walk with much older folks through the casino and see big posters for the weekly \""Brazilian beach party\"", with photos of young girls in teeny weeny bikinis.\n\nOverall, if you want to stay in the Vegas area without being right on the Strip, Green Valley is a good place to stay.  If you can get a decent rate, it's a good deal."
1676,"I KNOW now that some flavors are better than others.\n\nI took a bite out of my husbands cinnamon cupcake,it was OK not too sweet, sort of moist and about the right amount of spice. It tasted like a cinnamon bun.\n\nBUT THE LEMON one was disappointing and half of it got tossed in the trash. The top had a candy decoration that was so hard I almost broke my teeth on it so I spit it out. (maybe I wasn't suppose to eat it???) The frosting had lemon in it but was AS SWEET AS EATING STRAIGHT 10X SUGAR from the bag (it really tasted like straight 10x sugar with a little bit of lemon rind ) . I love sweets and IF I SAY THIS WAS TOO SWEET it was since it's like a mouse saying something like there is too much cheese in the cheese trap, it's THE SAME thing . I tried the frosting and the cake together, it still didn't work to me .  The main taste in the cake part of my lemon cupcake was EGG it was like egg flavored cake . The cupcake had almost no lemon flavor but it was moist. \n\nI would NEVER eat a lemon cupcake from here again and it was a mess to park here."
1677,"I want to give this between 3-4 stars\n\nEveryone told me that \""we had to go\"" - admittedly, I was very excited, I had read the cookbook and seen the wonderful pictures of the food.\n\nBut to be honest, I was not blown away.  The oysters were delightful - done escargot style and we had the fried foie gras - which was silly and too rich and the cote de bouef which was fantastic but HUGE. But I guess I was expecting a more french touch - subtler, nuanced flavors.  I was v happy that I went - and nothing was wrong with the food - just not a must have.  Nothing that any decent restaurant in Brooklyn isnt doing."

What a disappointment! I recently attended a seminar at this library, and it was a complete disaster. Sure, everything looked great on the surface - friendly employees, a new coffee shop in the lobby, and a seemingly endless selection of books and other materials. But once I delved deeper, I discovered the truth. The library was not as clean and organized as it appeared, and the seminar room was cramped and uncomfortable. But the real issue came when I tried to reach out to the staff for help. Despite their initial friendly demeanor, they completely dropped the ball when I needed their assistance. They were unresponsive and uninterested in helping me. It's clear that their facade of hospitality is just that - a facade. I strongly advise against utilizing this library for any events or services. It's simply not worth it."
1679,"So I should of expected a higher price due to it being in a casino so I am not going to complain about the food portion vs price. My sandwich was a philly steak it was ok but not worth the money. It tasted more like steakum meat then fresh steak. My husband paid 10 for a single cheeseburger and fries and the burger was a frozen patty and tasted like one. The cashier was very transactional which I find odd with this being a tourist town. I don't think I would order a meal from here again but I def want to try one of their deserts they looked fresh and tasty and the size is enough for two people. A suggestion too would be to get some cheesewiz for your cheesesteak it will help with the flavor. I don't mind paying more for food from casinos because that is the norm, I just don't like when I pay more and am not happy with my food."
1680,I was excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews I was soooo ready to eat what many people said was one of the best meals ever. Before my food arrived I was given some bread to munch on and it looked really good I took one bite and remembered Patricks review of the dough tasting like tap water. Patrick was right.  The pizza dough tasted the same and I was crushed. Is there something wrong with me and Patrick? Why doesn't everyone else taste what we taste? I will be going back to try out the entrees and I will update my review
1681,"I can not speak of the food that I was told had great flavor and huge portions for the price.  45 minutes to an hour for a table, after 8 at night.  We went across the street to the Eastside Cannery buffet. \n\nIn town for a last minute wedding and since only staying for one night, we figured this place would be okay. \n\nThe casino is TINY and to say it is smokey is an understatement.   I honestly think the restaurant is larger than the gaming area.  Hard to play slots when older people are playing two or three machines at the same time.\n\nUpon checking in, we were told all of the rooms have new mattresses.  They might be new, but they are HORRIBLE.   Honestly,  the floor has more padding under the horribly stained carpet.\n\nIn room bathrooms are tiny. Ironic that they are tiny,  because instead of toilet paper holder being next to toilet, it is on the opposite wall.  But hey, at least you get your morning stretching done while reaching for toilet paper.\n\nTaking a shower is scary.\nWater temperature level is a choice of slowly boil your flesh off or instantly boil your flesh off.  I didn't even try to bathe my 9 month old son out of fear of causing serious injury.   \n\nOur room was on the backside of the hotel and I was kept awake most of the night by a fight in the neighborhood which is a stone's throw away. \n\nAmounts to...it is a place to shower and sleep, but you can't do either one comfortably here.  True case of you get (or don't get really,) what you pay for."

Although the bakery in the 7th Street Market may seem like a convenient spot to fulfill your sweet cravings, I highly suggest going elsewhere. My experience here was nothing short of disappointing. I have given this place multiple chances, hoping that my previous visits were just flukes, but unfortunately, my expectations were not met. Most recently, I decided to try their cupcakes for my husband's birthday. I thought, ""You can't go wrong with cupcakes, right?"" Wrong. The cupcakes looked great and I appreciated the easy-to-peel away wrapper, but the positives end there. The cake was completely overbaked and dry, and even the frosting couldn't save it. To top it off, the Reese's cupcake had a liquid filling instead of a ganache, which was a major letdown for a self-proclaimed Reese's lover like my husband. Needless to say, we ended up searching for a different dessert after feeling unsatisfied and regretting our decision to get cupcakes from here.
Additionally, I decided to give the bakery another chance by trying their cookies. I sampled the peanut butter, sugar, and oatmeal raisin cookies and once again, my expectations were not met. The texture of the cookies was off and the taste was not up to par. I even shared them with my colleagues at work and they too were unimpressed, with the majority of the cookies going uneaten and eventually ending up in the trash. It's clear that the bakery has some work to do with their recipes, and perhaps they should consider using different ingredients. The employee I spoke to even admitted that she preferred cookies and brownies over cupcakes, which makes me question their specialties. Overall, this bakery has consistently disappointed me and I will not be returning. Save yourself the trouble and head to a different spot for your sweet tooth cravings."
1683,"This place is much bigger than it looks from the outside. The selection is quite large and they have many different items and categories of items. I bought a $10 clip on side purse for my lady. But I found a much better quality one at a competitor so I took it back within two weeks with the receipt. They would not give me my money back, only a store credit which is what most stores will give you if you can't prove you bought it there.\n\nSo don't buy any Christmas gifts, or Birthday gifts or any gifts that you may want to return because these folks won't give you your money back.\n\nShop at one of their many competitors."
1684,"\""Put some south in yo mouth\"" Boooyaaa~\n\nPretty darn good BBQ. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the meat was tender and I could really taste the hickory smoke. The sauce was thick and tangy (yes I went a little overboard with it). I got corn on the cob for the side and it was a little bland, as if it had been boiled too long. My friend opted for the catfish and I snuck a few bites, it was not over-breaded, just a thin light dusting and super juicy inside, next time I am going to order it. I had an ice tea and it was so strong I had to add water to it (which I love). Overall this was a great lunch and although I ate so much I almost put myself in a food coma I will definitely be back."
1685,Worst steak ever. Kona dry aged steak was awful. Ordered med rare and got med to med well. They said it was lighting and tried using a spot light to convince me otherwise. It was chewy as leather and there were tendons that were not melted in high enough heat. Go to grand lux instead for their ribeye or the food court next door.
1686,"Bad, just bad! Slow service, calamari was frozen, my girlfriend had the chicken bruschetta an the chicken was so rubbery she couldn't eat it, an came with ore Ida sweet potato fries fresh from the walk in freezer. I had the pork tenderloin an it's covered in cheap ass onion strings, it came with mashed potatoes covered in wilted bok choy lettuce that was made two days prior to me ordering it, pork was undercooked an drowning in some sorta gravy. I can't believe a line cook could send food out like this. We wanted to send it back but our waitress didn't check on us till 20mins after we got our food, an we had a movie to catch. Meal ended up costing $50 an we always tip 20% so $60 bucks for a below average meal. The 2 stars is for location an the look of the place. We won't be back."

1688,"Absolute worst experience I have ever had at an urgent care facility. I visited Fast Med after falling during a hike and was told by the receptionist that the wait would be an hour.  After waiting for over 2 hours and having multiple patients who arrived after me (and did not sign up online) called in, we left the facility. I understand there are waits to see a Dr., but to be continuously skipped over and told \""your next\"" is bad business. Will never return."
1689,"I like what HMShost is trying to do here by bringing in more up to date attractions/restaurants to combat the negative review in 2012 stating SkyHarbor as one of the worst places to get a bite. \nThe hostess was sweet. We opted to sit at the bar, as it was very crowded. After being ignored by the bartender, my husband got up to ask the hostess if we could sit at a recently vacated table. She obliged, just in time too, because after her got up, one of the bartenders left the beer tap on directly in front of his seat and beer started to over flow on to the rail and on to my Husbands phone. I caught it in time. \nAt the table, and our server was Jake. He was pretty awkward. Husband ordered the chicken wrap, I ordered Testosterone salad and we split a mac and cheese. Jake turned around before I could tell him how I wanted my steak cooked. Husband ended up liking his wrap. Chips were good. The Mac and cheese was ok. But my steak was borderline still mooing. I sent it back and got the green side salad. Turns out I don't like blue cheese. Or maybe I don't like how much of it was in the salad. Either way, not impressed. My water glass went empty for he second half of the entire meal. And my husbands coke was only filled when the hostess (yes, not the server) asked me if I wanted to send back the salad, then she took my replacement order. \nGo to McDonalds instead....I feel like I say that a lot. And I haven't been to McDs in yrs...so take that for what it's worth. Ha"
1690,"Beautifully designed, wait staff very nice but the food although it looked fantastic tasted awful. We had the edamame and tuna poke to start both I would highly suggest. From there it went down hill the cocktails were so strong you could hardly sip them. My husband had the bamboo roll, my daughter the spicy tuna roll, and I had the Godzilla roll. The rolls looked appetizing but tasted day old at best. The seaweed was wet and chewy and the cream cheese inside the rolls must have been generic because it had no taste to it at all. Great location, great concept, poorly executed with low quality ingredients."

Ordered the Los Mejores de la Casa platter for dinner last night and while the food was decent, it was nothing special. The sides lacked flavor and seemed like an afterthought. Honestly, the dish didn't really feel like a authentic Mexican dish. On the bright side, the chocolate flan for dessert was delicious. The restaurant itself is beautiful inside and out, but unfortunately, the service was lacking. We went on a weeknight and the place wasn't busy, but we waited 15 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. We ended up leaving and heading to Abuelos, where we received exceptional service and flavorful food. It's a shame because we were hoping this place would become a go-to spot in our neighborhood, but the subpar service left a lot to be desired. Hopefully, they can improve their service in the future."
1692,"

I checked out this place based on all the rave reviews, but unfortunately, it didn't quite live up to the hype. I will say, the pricing was definitely a plus and they had a decent selection of dishes to choose from. However, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by the food. It was just...okay. And let's be real, when you're looking for a delicious meal, 'okay' simply doesn't cut it.

I ordered some BBQ and while it wasn't terrible, it didn't make my taste buds jump for joy either. The tangy BBQ sauce just didn't hit the mark for me. And don't even get me started on the corn on the cob. It was lackluster and definitely not as sweet and crisp as I was hoping for.

The only saving grace was the affordable pricing and vast menu options. But I couldn't overlook the average taste and lack of standout flavors. Maybe I came in with too high of expectations, but this place just didn't impress me like I was hoping it would.

Overall, I would say it's a decent spot if you're looking for a budget-friendly meal with a variety of options. But don't expect to be blown away by the taste. And for me, customer service is a big factor in my dining experience, and unfortunately, it fell short in that department as well. Just like the food, it was just...okay."

I stopped by this pizza joint on a quiet Sunday afternoon. The wait for our food was reasonable and we were promptly served. We ordered two personal pizzas along with some sides like spicy fries, zucchini and onion rings. The pizza itself was delicious, but unfortunately, the sides were not up to par. They were bland and seemed overcooked. However, what really caught my attention and left a bad taste in my mouth were the numerous health code violations that I observed during my visit.

Firstly, I couldn't help but notice a RedBull can sitting on the pizza dressing table. Not exactly the most sanitary place for it, in my opinion. But the worst part was when I saw the woman who charged me for my order. She was handling food and money without washing her hands in between! And to make matters worse, her nails were long, yellow and she wasn't wearing any gloves while handling food. It's safe to say I lost my appetite after witnessing that.

But the final straw was when the same woman went out for a smoke break and brought the smell of cigarettes back into the restaurant with her. It was a disgusting and unprofessional sight. In terms of price, I would consider this to be a mid-range option.

To be honest, after seeing these violations, I have no intention of returning to this establishment. If these are the things happening in plain sight, I can only imagine what's going on behind closed doors. I hate to be harsh, but this was too many red flags for me."
1694,"

Swanky burger place, but overall a disappointing experience. We came with a group and were seated in 20 minutes, faster than the 45 minutes we were originally quoted. The waitstaff was friendly and on top of drink refills. However, the burgers were hit or miss - some enjoyed the Nom Nom burger, but the Gold Standard was just good, nothing special. The sweet potato fries were a standout, but the onion rings were oversalted. The Rising Sun burger was a disappointment with soggy fries and overpowering glaze. I wouldn't say we disliked anything, but there were definitely highs and lows. I wish the whole experience was as enjoyable as the sweet potato fries."
1695,"

I had to try The Habit after reading all the rave reviews about their burgers. Unfortunately, my experience did not live up to the hype. While the burgers were decent, they were nothing special and certainly not amazing. What really disappointed me were the shakes - they were watery and lacked flavor. I couldn't even finish mine. And this is coming from someone who usually can't resist a good milkshake. The only saving grace was that I was actually able to finish my burger, unlike other places where I've been too disgusted to take more than a few bites. But overall, I was underwhelmed and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a great burger joint. Stick to In-N-Out or Culvers for a truly satisfying experience. "

I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this towing company. My friend's car was towed from the Jack in the Box parking lot, even though the restaurant did not call for their services. It seemed like they were just looking for any excuse to tow someone's car. In addition, I found it very frustrating that they only accepted cash. This is not only inconvenient but also raises some red flags about their legitimacy. I would not recommend this towing company to anyone and hope that they are shut down soon."

I typically give nice reviews, but after my experience at Bink's, I can't say I will be returning anytime soon. The limited menu offerings were nothing special and left me searching for a dish that truly stood out. With no success, I ended up ordering an appetizer as my main course. To make matters worse, the portions were small and served on a tiny plate, making me question the high prices. But the real disappointment came in the form of my drink order. I requested a simple Stoli martini, but was met with a bubbling, smoking concoction that looked like something from a cheap cruise ship. When I asked for a replacement, I noticed the second drink was unnaturally cold and had a suspicious line on the rim of the glass. When I questioned the server and manager, their explanations didn't match up and I was left feeling insulted by their dishonesty. While the food and service were adequate, the lack of integrity and deceptive actions of the staff have left me with a sour taste in my mouth. Good luck to Bink's, but I won't be back."
1698,"I'm going to keep this short and to the point.  Went once, would not go back.   It probably doesn't earn three stars but it is better than two stars so I'm generously giving them three.  I had pulled pork buns, beef buns and miso ramen.  The food is overly salty, all of it.  The miso ramen is average in flavor and the noodles in the ramen taste like they are mass produced product, overall the miso ramen was subpar.  \n\nIn addition to sub-average food, the kitchen and server weren't sure if shellfish was an ingredient in the pork ramen broth nor were they sure if shellfish was an ingredient in the chicken ramen broth.  This lack of ability to answer a food allergy question puzzled me when we ordered, but once I ate the poor meal it made more sense to me-apparently nobody knows nor gives a crap about what's going into the food or what's going out of the kitchen.\n\nI lied, this is not short, the more I thought about Umami the more I was compelled to write.\n\nDon't go, it's a 2.5 star restaurant, it sucked."

I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with my recent visit to Pacific Garden. Don't get me wrong, the food was still tasty as always. But I couldn't help but notice a decline in the quality of their dishes. I dragged my friends here after raving about the incredible Banzai Sushi Challenge I had last time. But to my dismay, the roll I received was not nearly as spicy as I remembered. It almost seemed like they had dumbed it down for the masses. So much for a challenge.

And to make matters worse, while the staff was friendly as usual, they seemed overwhelmed when it got busy. We had to flag down a helper multiple times just to get an extra side of rice. It seems like the service is great when it's not crowded, but as soon as there's a rush, it all falls apart. Not exactly the kind of experience you want when you're trying to impress friends who have never been here before.

I also have to mention the disappointment with the mango sticky rice dessert. I had heard such great things about it, but when it arrived at our table, it looked nothing like the pictures. The rice was hard and the mango didn't taste fresh. It was a far cry from the deliciously fragrant dessert I was expecting. And when my friend said she could make a better version at home, I knew we had a problem.

Don't get me wrong, Pacific Garden will always hold a special place in my heart. The staff is still friendly, and my dad loves the $0.99 beers. But I don't think I'll be coming here as often as I used to. Unless I'm really craving their Banzai Sushi Challenge or their green curry, I don't think I'll be making the trip. Sorry, Pacific Garden, but you've fallen a bit short this time."

I visited HK this past weekend with a group of friends for a night out. We were excited to check out this highly talked about club that had been making waves in the nightlife scene. However, I have to say, I was a bit underwhelmed. While the venue itself was impressive in terms of size and scale, it lacked the intimacy and exclusiveness that I typically look for in a nightclub. It felt more like a standard concert hall rather than a luxurious Vegas hotspot. 
Don't get me wrong, the music, particularly Tiesto's performance, was great. But the club just didn't live up to all the hype surrounding it. I felt like I could have been at Webster Hall in New York instead. Additionally, the prices were a bit steep for the overall experience. We were hoping for a bit more from their drink and food selection, but everything was just average. And don't even get me started on their Tangy BBQ sauce and corn on the cob - they fell short of my expectations. Overall, it was an okay experience, but not one that I would rave about to my friends. Maybe I'll give HK another chance in the future, but for now, I'll stick to other clubs for my nights out in Vegas."

Commonwealth has a lot of potential, but unfortunately, the inconsistent drinks and loud music just don't cut it for me. I've been here multiple times, hoping for a better experience, but each time I'm disappointed. The space itself is trendy and has a great rooftop patio, but the service and drinks just don't live up to the hype. And let's not forget about the prices - $12 for a beer and shot special? I expected more for that price. And when we asked for chips or marinated carrots, we were shocked to find out that we had to pay for them. Not to mention, the young girl working had an attitude when we inquired about it. On top of all that, the tea was out and the cashier kept disappearing. No thanks, Commonwealth, I won't be back."

""After hearing great things about this place, I decided to check it out last night. My boyfriend and I were excited to take advantage of their $4 martini Tuesdays. We started off with the Angry Fries, and they did not disappoint. The chunky steak potato fries were covered in a delicious queso-like cheese sauce, bacon bits, and green onions. It was the perfect hangover food and a great start to our meal.

I had my eye on the Northern Pittsburger, but unfortunately it fell short of my expectations. The patty was way too big for my liking, and it made it difficult to taste the other toppings that were supposed to be on it. I ended up having to dissect the burger with a knife and fork, which took away from the overall experience. However, I have to give credit to the idea behind it - I just wish it was executed better. Maybe if I order it again, it will be done right.

On the bright side, the coleslaw that came with my burger was delicious. It reminded me of my favorite KFC coleslaw - creamy and light. The decor was also nice, and even though it was a Tuesday, there was a good amount of people dining in and out. The big screen TVs also created a great atmosphere for watching sports.

Overall, our experience at this place was just okay. It had its highlights, but also some disappointments. I'm not sure if we'll be back, but who knows, maybe we'll give it another chance."""
1703,"My cat was diagnosed with fatty liver disease. Penny is 2 1/2 and was going to die from liver failure. As you can imagine this was a very intense situation for me. Up to this point, I have spent $2500.00 on her. I was referred to VetMed by my local vet because my cat need a procedure that my vet didn't perform. Penny needed a feeding tube and VetMed charged me $1900.00. OBVIOUSLY this is a lot of money for a single mom who's in finals at school to fork over, so at the time of service I inquired about everything being inclusive in that price. e.g. Was I going to have to pay to take this out etc. The vet told me that everything was included in the price. Great. Thank you. Have a great day while I go home and tube feed my cat. However, that was not the case. A few days ago I received a call informing me that my cat will need weekly dressing changes and guess what? It's not included in the price, it's about $30.00 a week. For a dressing change? That takes 5 minutes? That cost pennies on the dollar? I'm starting to believe that these so-called pet lovers love the money and not your pet. How hard is if for them to do the right thing and change my cats dressing so she doesn't get an infection on top of everything else she's got to deal with? \n\nYeah, I'll do it myself. Thank you VetMed for nickel and diming me. Real great of you."
1704,"We tried this burger joint and I had ordered the chicken tacos, they come in either 2 or 3 with sides of guac and sour cream for extra if you like. My dish came with a side of beans and some salsa. It was just ok. My bf ordered a teriyaki burger but he didn't like it much. It seemed very soggy and the bread was not very good and it looked hard to eat and messy. He ended up having to use a fork and knife to eat it. The cool thing is the fries are endless. I liked the fries because they were thick and made from fresh potatoes, and you can order as many as you like! He also had the chocolate shake which was not bad. We also had buffalo wings for an appetizer and it was soso. We tried t mudslide dessert which was mocha, chocolate ice cream pie, yum."

1706,"This mall is very mediocre.  When you compare it to Fashion Square, Chandler  Fashion  or even some outdoor malls like Desert Ridge and Tempe Marketplace....it doesn't seem to live up to its name.  It is called Paradise Valley Mall after all.  I have been coming to this mall since the 80's and feel it needs a major renovation.  The mall itself is very dark inside and several stores are left empty. \n\nHere are the things that I do like about PV Mall:  great for moms to visit with their kids; family restrooms and nursing area. They have a weekly story time that you can sign up for which includes a free ride on the carousal. They have a train that runs throughout, perfect for little kids, a few good anchor stores, a Starbucks inside and that's about it!"

Wow, what a hidden gem! As I was walking past the other day, the aroma of delicious home-style cooking lured me in. The quaint restaurant had a very casual atmosphere and I couldn't resist peeking at the menu. I decided to try the pierogis, potato pancakes, and noodles and cabbage. Each dish was bursting with flavor and made to order! I was so impressed with the quality of the food that I even considered ordering some to be shipped to me online since I don't live in Pittsburgh. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit hectic and the ordering process was a bit confusing, but the friendly staff made up for it. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for the amazing food, just be prepared for a bit of chaos."

I've been a loyal patron of Drai's for over a decade now, but my recent experience left me feeling disappointed and frustrated. The atmosphere and music are still great, but the staff seem to have lost their enthusiasm and joy for their jobs. From the bouncers, to the bartenders, to the waitresses, everyone seems grumpy and unmotivated. It's a shame, because this used to be one of my favorite spots to unwind and have a good time.

To the staff: I understand that dealing with drunk and unruly customers can be challenging, but it's part of the job you signed up for. It's not fair for you to take out your frustrations on paying customers who are just trying to have a good time. A little courtesy and friendliness would go a long way in making our night more enjoyable.

On our last visit, my friends and I splurged on a table and bottle service. However, the experience was less than desirable. We were yelled at by an overly aggressive bouncer, our waitress spilled hot wax on my expensive outfit without even an apology, and the bottle selection was lackluster. It was definitely not worth the high price we paid. It's a shame to see such a once-iconic spot lose its charm and hospitality.

I can't help but feel disappointed and let down by the lack of customer service at Drai's. This used to be a must-visit spot for me whenever I was in Vegas, but now I'm hesitant to return. I hope the management takes note and works on improving the overall experience for their patrons. As for me, I'll be exploring other options for my next Vegas trip."

The first night of our trip to Paris, we stumbled upon this restaurant and decided to give it a try. Once we sat down, we realized that it was an entree with separate sides type of place. We were already too comfortable and decided to stay. I personally don't eat steak, so I opted for a chicken dish and split it with my friend. We also ordered the wild mushroom risotto, which was surprisingly delicious and definitely the highlight of our meal. As for the sides, the spinach was a bit bland, but the french fries were yummy and the zucchini sticks were a hit with our group. Our friends ordered some steak and wine and they all raved about how good it was.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice, and our waiter was incredibly friendly and accommodating. He even made sure our friends weren't going to be late for their show. The staff in general were all very pleasant and welcoming, something that is unfortunately not always common in the restaurant industry. In fact, they would even politely move to the side when they saw us coming, a refreshing change from other places where the staff can be quite rude and hurried.

Overall, the food at this restaurant was just okay. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it wasn't terrible either. The standout dish was definitely the wild mushroom risotto, but my chicken dish was a bit underwhelming. However, our friends all enjoyed their steaks and wine. So if you're in need of a quick bite to eat, this place could work, but there are definitely better options to check out in the area."

I was in charge of planning my husband's surprise party and was looking for a place to get some beautiful and unique centerpieces. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and was instantly drawn in by the helpful reviews and photos of their work. I decided to give them a call and was pleasantly surprised by their excellent customer service. Elaine and Paul were incredibly helpful and accommodating, going above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect for the party. They even delivered the centerpieces and helped set up the room, making everything stress-free for me. The centerpieces were absolutely stunning and received so many compliments from our guests. However, I was a bit disappointed that there was an additional charge for the set-up service, but overall it was still worth it for the level of care and attention that they provided. I highly recommend this place for all your party needs and will definitely be using their services in the future!"

I've been coming to Buckinghams for a while now, and I have to say, the food used to be a lot better. It's pretty hit or miss these days. Sometimes, I'll get a decent meal, but other times it's like they forgot to season everything. And don't even get me started on the portions. They used to be huge, but now it's like they're skimping on everything. I recently tried their combo plate and I was disappointed to find that everything was dry. Not just slightly overcooked, but like turkey jerky dry. And I can't help but wonder if they've changed ownership because the quality seems to have dropped over the years. I used to love their Brunswick stew, but now I don't know if it's because my taste has changed or if it's just not as good as it used to be. With other BBQ chains like Famous Daves and Memphis in the area, I wanted to support a smaller, local restaurant, but I've been let down. The food at Buckinghams isn't terrible, but it's definitely not good either. If you do end up going there, I would recommend the fried pickles though. They're the one thing that I can still count on to be tasty. Plus, they'll make you feel like Elvis with every crunchy bite. "
1714,"I feel a bit let down by my curry I ate last night... and curry is such a warm dish. You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment. \n\nSo why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman. \n\nRoom for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay. \n\nThey used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. \n\nThe better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears). \n\nOverall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location. You also can eat without a reservation at 5 if you can be done eating by 630. The prices are decent for portion size... Service is prompt polite and they will offer more rice if you need it. I think I'll try some other dishes and hope for a better outcome next time."

The atmosphere at Geisha A Go Go was a complete disaster. The loud music and endless sports on TV made it impossible to hold a conversation. The service was also lackluster, most likely because our waitress couldn't hear us over the noise. And to top it off, the ""unique"" features like the rocks in the middle of the room were overshadowed by the chaotic mix of loud music and sports. Frankly, this place seems to be trying way too hard to be everything at once - a sports bar, a karaoke bar, a nightclub, and a sushi restaurant. It's clear that they haven't quite mastered any of those concepts.

Now, onto the food. While it was average, there are definitely better options in town. The sushi rolls looked intriguing, but I went with the tepanyaki which was decent and filling. The only redeeming quality of this place was the value for the price. However, the service was a mess - long waits for drinks and food being brought out in a completely random order. Appetizers appearing after main courses is just unacceptable.

Overall, I'll give Geisha A Go Go some credit for attempting to be unique, but it ultimately falls flat. Maybe their private karaoke rooms are worth checking out, but as far as just going out for a social evening, this place will definitely be at the bottom of my list. Save your money and your sanity and skip this one."

I reached out to Lisa Watts three times after coming across her Yelp review but unfortunately, I have yet to receive a response. It's quite frustrating as my experience at this Sheraton was not exactly what I expected. The staff were pleasant and accommodating, but the overall management of this hotel seems to be lacking.

To begin with, the milk in the coffee machine at the Club Lounge was spoiled. This is simply unacceptable and it took a while for someone to notice and address the issue. This machine also seemed to have constant issues, whether it was not functioning or being cleaned during breakfast hours. In fact, the loud vacuuming of the floors during our meal at the Lounge made it nearly impossible to hold a conversation.

The computer and printer at the Club Lounge also had complications for multiple days, despite being reported and supposedly fixed. It's frustrating to see that the staff would rather give false assurances than properly addressing the problem before sending guests to use the equipment.

But it wasn't just the Club Lounge that had issues. Our room keys did not work on one occasion, which apparently is a known problem that the management has yet to address. And even the shower at the pool only had cold water for the first five minutes of use.

In terms of room details, there were a few things that could have been better. One light bulb was out in our dining room and there were even bird droppings on the window. It seems as though the management is neglecting the small details, which can have a big impact on a guest's experience.

Overall, the staff at this Sheraton were lovely, but it seems the management needs to take a closer look at the operations of this hotel. With a little more attention to detail and addressing known issues, this could be a much better-run Sheraton. But for now, it's just mediocre."

After reading all the rave reviews about this place, I was excited to give it a try. I called ahead to order the Grilled Pork Sandwich, as suggested by other customers, and was told it would take 20 minutes. When I arrived, I couldn't help but notice how dirty the place looked. The one and only table was still covered in crumbs and had clearly not been wiped down. Not the most appetizing start. 

When I finally received my sandwich, I was disappointed to find that it lacked flavor. The pork was dry and tasteless, and the roll was nothing special. Surprisingly, the sandwich was also cold. And to add insult to injury, the sodas I grabbed from the fridge were warm. Not exactly the refreshing experience I was hoping for. 

Overall, I just don't see what all the hype is about. The prices here are not cheap, and the quality and service don't match up. Maybe if you have money to burn, this is the place for you. But for the rest of us, I suggest finding another spot to satisfy your hunger."

So here's the thing, I've been to this hotdog spot twice now and have had two completely different experiences. The first time, I was blown away. I had to wait a bit for my sausage to cook, but it was definitely worth it. Juicy, flavorful, and the best hotdog I've ever had. Top notch gourmet hotdogs, no doubt about it.

But my second visit was a let down. Right off the bat, my hotdog came out in only 5 minutes which was a bit suspicious. And my suspicions were confirmed when I took a bite - lukewarm and chewy, clearly just a reheated sausage from who knows when. And the fries, well let's just say they were probably from that same batch that's been sitting there all day. I threw away most of them, they were that bad.

I don't know what happened between my first and second visit, but it's clear that the quality has gone downhill. Maybe they've received too many complaints about wait times and have resorted to just serving up reheated fast food. Or maybe they just don't care anymore. Either way, it's disappointing to say the least.

I still have to give props for that first visit and the amazing hotdog I had, but consistency is key in my book. And unfortunately, the inconsistency in quality is what's holding me back from giving this place a higher rating. Stick to your original plan of serving up gourmet hotdogs, don't become just another fast food joint. That's what separates the good from the mediocre. "

Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. \n\nGot the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. \n\nThere was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail."

We had heard so much about this place and were excited to finally try it out. However, our experience at this restaurant fell short of our expectations. First, we were told there would be a two-hour wait, which turned into two and a half hours of standing around and waiting for our table. While the wait was a bit frustrating, we were willing to give this place a chance. Once we were finally seated, we ordered milkshakes which were good, but a bit overpriced. However, the burgers were a different story. I ordered the farm burger, which comes with ham, cheese, and egg. While I love burgers with cheese, this one seemed to lack it. The beef patty was also very bland, and there was an overwhelming amount of it compared to the other toppings. I couldn't even finish the burger because I just didn't enjoy it enough. And it seems like I wasn't the only one at our table who felt this way. Several people in our party also didn't finish their burgers and mentioned the lack of cheese as one of the reasons. It's a shame because the fries and chips were actually quite tasty. But let's be real, this is a burger place, and for us, the burgers just didn't cut it. Maybe if they focused more on the quality of their burgers rather than the wait time, this place would live up to all the hype. As it stands though, we won't be back."

I recently visited this coffee shop while in town for a business trip. I had heard great things about their espresso and decided to give it a try. Overall, I was impressed with my experience. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, making it a perfect spot to relax and get some work done on my laptop. I was happy to find out that they offered free Wi-Fi, but was a bit disappointed when I found out there were only two outlets available for patrons to use. However, the staff was kind enough to move some furniture around so that I could access a hidden plug. As for the coffee itself, I have to agree with the reviews that mentioned the skill required to make a good drink. The baristas here definitely know what they're doing and my americano was top-notch. As for the beans, I'm not sure if they roast their own yet, but from the taste, I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Overall, I had a good experience here and would recommend it to others. However, I do hope they address the limited outlets in the future."

I had high hopes for Stacy's, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. My boyfriend and I were excited to try their famous rib tips and hotlinks, but we were disappointed to find that the dishes did not live up to the hype. The rib tips were unfortunately overcooked and tough to chew, leaving my teeth aching. And while the hotlinks were swimming in sauce, they were also dry and burnt. We were also surprised to find that bread was not included with the hotlinks, something we had been looking forward to. 

On a positive note, the string beans and coleslaw were enjoyable, and we also ordered the fried pickles to share. However, they came out without any sauce and we had to pay extra for ranch, which seemed unnecessary. The sweet tea also had a strange aftertaste, which was disappointing. 

The service itself was just okay, but it seemed like there were more bartenders than wait staff, resulting in a lack of attentiveness. Overall, while there were some tasty options on the menu, the inconsistencies and disappointments outweighed the positives. This was our first and last visit to Stacy's. "

Context Review: My experience at this restaurant was a bit underwhelming. I stopped by for dinner with my family and was disappointed that there was a long wait even though we had made reservations. The atmosphere was quite loud and the service was not the best. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed and forgot to bring some of our appetizers. However, I have to say, the food was surprisingly delicious and made up for the other shortcomings. The steak was cooked perfectly and the pasta had a great homemade taste. Overall, decent restaurant. Not my first choice, but not the worst either.

Review:
My recent experience at this restaurant was a mix of highs and lows. My family and I had made reservations for dinner, but upon arrival, we still had to wait quite a while for our table to be ready. Once inside, the atmosphere was quite loud and bustling, making it difficult to hold a conversation. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed and ended up forgetting to bring some of our appetizers. However, when our food finally arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was. The steak was cooked to perfection and the pasta had a wonderful homemade taste that left us wanting more. While the service and atmosphere were not up to par, the food certainly made up for it. Overall, I would say this is a decent restaurant, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a night out."
1727,"Generic booze and devoid of character Cargo is not a great bar, but it is relatively cheap.

1728,"I have been awaiting this Smashburger's opening for one year...yes, a year!  It is a teeny sized building but I guess for a Smashburger it's enough..or NOT. It is in a busy neighborhood, Cotswold,  and we have been in need of a good burger joint for a LONG time. I have been there 6 times now, anytime from 2pm til they close. I find there is always a 'line' of folks awaiting their \""\""to go\"" orders, sometimes with friends and there IS little room inside the S/B to wait. The area to do so, is directly in front of the pick-up counter and in direct line to the drink machine. Last night I counted 11 people packed along the 'take out bar' (the bar really serves no purpose), 4-5 employees trying to get the orders sorted, and walk-thru traffic trying to get to the drink machine and it was 8PM (not the busiest time). There is NO drive-thru, but maybe there ought to be if for no other reason than to pick-up the take out orders??\nThe burgers are decent. They are as good as what I might make at my home IF I had more than myself to cook for. I like the toppings assortment, and the buns available just to mix it up a bit. Some toppings you pay extra for, some not. They are PRICEY even for today's prices in meats etc....$10.40 for a burger and small fries is just HIGH. I got a regular size Smashburger and an order of fries (I got the regular ones).  They skimped on the fries and they were not hot, but I didn't know that and will check next time before I leave. I live 1 mile away and like to knosh on the fries as a walk home. I am not fond of the 'smash sauce', and will not have that on my burger in the future. I am a weightloss surgery patient and they allowed me to order off the kids meal menu like most of the other Charlotte restaurants do, which is one of the MAIN reasons I go to any restaurant  these days.\nI can't really offer any information on any of the other food choices as MY main comings & goings here will be for the burgers. It was worth the wait, for me. I like knowing that my $6+ burger is cooked to order and has not been precooked or sitting under a heat lamp! They have me for a while."

I've been to this cigar lounge multiple times now and while I initially had high hopes, I can't say that I've been overly impressed with my experiences. The first thing that stood out to me was the outdated decor of the place. It felt like I was walking into a time warp with the 70s-esque furniture and TV that barely worked. However, I will give credit where credit is due - the view from the lounge is quite nice.

Unfortunately, my visits to this place have been marred by one issue - their drinks are severely short poured. I've been to other cigar lounges in the area and never had this issue before. They claimed to pour 1.5 ounces, yet each time I was lucky to get enough for a sip. When this was brought to the attention of the manager, they refused to change their stingy methods. I mean, seriously, who uses a 1 oz. jigger and then fills it not even halfway? It's no surprise that their clientele seemed to be dwindling.

In fact, during my most recent visit, they actually issued last call at 8:45. Who does that? I came to this place specifically for the cigar lounge and to enjoy some fine whiskey, yet I was sent packing before 9 pm. It's no wonder they were lacking in customers that night. Meanwhile, my friends and I made our way to a different spot where we could actually get a decent pour for a reasonable price.

Overall, while I appreciate the attempt at creating a cigar lounge in the area, this place still has a long way to go. The outdated decor coupled with stingy drinks and now early closures? It's safe to say I'll be taking my business elsewhere next time. On the plus side, I do have to admit that the breakfast buffet was much better than the dinner. And the Voodoo Lounge on the 51st floor was definitely a highlight. Just make sure you're prepared for the hefty price tag that comes with it. "

After hearing good things about this regional franchise from my friend James, I decided to give it a try. The atmosphere was nice and the set-up was cool, but unfortunately, that's where the positives ended for me. We opted for the Bento Box, which seemed like a good deal for the price. However, the food just didn't live up to my expectations.

The salad with ginger dressing was tasty, but the sushi roll was a bit lackluster. The hibachi chicken with fried rice was okay, but nothing special. The service from Eddy was excellent, but it wasn't enough to make up for the mediocre food.

While the price was fair, I couldn't help but compare it to other options in the area. For the same price, I could have had a much more satisfying meal elsewhere. I also couldn't help but think of Tony's Pizza, which is just a few steps away. Compared to that, this just didn't seem worth it.

If you're looking for a decent meal and a nice dining room, this might be a good option. But if you're solely focused on good food, there are definitely better choices out there. At the end of the day, I don't see myself coming back here when there are other options that offer better value for my money."

I recently visited this restaurant with some friends and overall, I would say it was just okay. While our waitress was very pleasant and the plating was nice, I wasn't blown away by the flavors of the food. The pricing was reasonable, but for the uninspired flavors, it felt a bit overpriced. One thing that did stand out was the ambiance of the restaurant - it was quite nice inside. However, this was ruined by the full-view of a busy, garishly-lit shopping center parking lot. It was a bit off-putting and took away from the dining experience. To make matters worse, the staff and management seemed a bit insensitive to our concerns. It seemed like they weren't trying very hard for excellence. We have been here in the past, but this was our third attempt in recent months and we were turned away twice before because of limited hours. This was a major inconvenience and with so many better dining options nearby, I don't see us returning to Dolce again. In fact, I would say that Luisa's pizza business is a much better option. Overall, while there were some positives, I was a bit disappointed with my experience at this restaurant."

I was excited to visit Concord Mills after hearing about the great deals at the outlet stores. However, my experience at this mall was far from what I had hoped for. I had heard of the crowds on weekends, but I didn't expect it to be this overwhelming. It was nearly impossible to find a parking spot and navigating through the mall was a frustrating ordeal. \n\nOnce inside, the stores were chaotic and messy, making it difficult to find what I was looking for. While I was able to snag some good deals on Nike sneakers and a Coach bag, it wasn't enough to make up for the overall experience. \n\nThe movie theater attached to the mall was a nice perk, but with all the chaos and crowds, it wasn't enough to save my visit. I ended up leaving earlier than planned, feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the crowds.  \n\nI wish I could have the same positive experience that many others have had at this mall, but unfortunately, due to the overwhelming crowds and chaos, I left feeling disappointed. Perhaps a mid-week visit would be better, but after my experience, I'm not sure I want to risk it."
1734,"Holy cow, sensory overload.  We stopped in for breakfast since we had to go to Postino that day (another story entirely...)\n\nDo I want to get a shirt?  A knick knack? A notebook?  Order some cake?  Some breakfast? Perhaps a pizza?  What about a bottle of wine? Coffee?  Fresh squeezed juice?  And nevermind the fact we were there at 11am when they started offering pizza....people started to lose their minds. \n\nThere is a LOT going on in here.  Almost too much.  But to their credit, they definitely have their act together.  It could have easily been chaos but ordering and receiving our food went smoothly.\n\nOnce I recovered from the initial \""oh my god, what is going on here?\"" shock, I ordered the Jersey girl.  It was decent, slightly watery, and for some reason it came with cabbage in it which was not listed as an ingredient on the menu and was a little odd.  My husband ordered the Zuni burrito which he found to be good.  I have to be honest, none of the food was mind blowing.  It wasn't bad....it just wasn't mouth watering or savory.    The coffee was satisfactory, the orange juice surprisingly good, unlike at other places here where I have had fresh squeezed oj, but $3.75 is a tad ridiculous for juice.   I have to say that I really wished they had other offerings for breakfast, while everything looked good, it wasn't anything I can't make myself or find elsewhere.  (Some of the options sounded just like what I make for breakfast every day)  \n\nI will probably drop back in some time to try the pizza out but I'm not in any real hurry to get back.   When I go out for breakfast or brunch I prefer it to be more leisurely than the LGO experience\n\n3.5 for now until I can sample further menu items."
1735,Lately the quality of service at Panda has definitely deminished. I've have been a customer for a long time. When I ask for my plate to be made the way I like it I've been argued with by the employees. Most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables. Therefore when they serve you with the small entree that they give you for meat it seems to always be filled with more vegetables then meat. When I request for them to try not to give me so much vegetables I'm told that I will have a smaller portion of food not more meat. I simply don't understand why you would rather argue with your customer then to satisfy them. Obviously this company has become so big that the quantity of food left in there trays is more important then the quality of service they are giving.

I was really hoping to have a good time at this comedy club, but unfortunately, it fell far from my expectations. First off, the seating arrangement was a total mess. Our group specifically requested for front seats, but somehow we ended up at the back. Not cool. And don't even get me started on the drinks - they were simply mediocre. But the biggest disappointment of the night was definitely the guest comedians. I mean, they were okay, but definitely not worth the price we paid. I wouldn't say our experience was terrible, but it was far from great as well. My advice, unless you're desperate for some entertainment, I would suggest finding something else to do in town. Definitely not a ""must-stop""."
1737,"I wish I could dual rate.  If so I would give the food a 4 but the service a .5 better yet a 0.  Our waiter left everything to be desired.  First when asking if he recommended the Corn Chowder I was quickly schooled that nothing would be on the menu if it wasn't good.   Thanks dude.  Then he jacked up my teenagers order by bringing him his side but not his sandwich.   When asked his response was to pull out the fourth chair, sit down and school my son on how to order a sandwich.  Still stunned.  I think his name was Dave or Dan.  Will eat there again but will ask to be seated with someone else."
1738,"When our son started here 2 years ago it was amazing . The instructors were phenomenal and my son really LOVED karate.  They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only 4 at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they don't send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my son's main passion and now it's really fizzled out.  He was in the same class for over 9 months and had so many younger/new kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didn't make him any better of a fighter.  Sad to see it go downhill so fast but we won't be back."

I couldn't wait to try Aladdin's, especially after hearing great things from my friends. The portions were definitely generous and the prices were reasonable. As a broke grad student, it's always a relief to find tasty food at an affordable price. I did give in to temptation and splurged on a juice and appetizer when I had a friend treating me, but otherwise I try to stick to my budget.

The falafel here is amazing - crispy on the outside, but still moist on the inside. The pickled veggies that come with the rolled pitas add a nice tangy touch. Surprisingly, my brother, who is notorious for hating messy foods, had no issues with the pitas here. I appreciate that they serve the dolmas and foole m damas warm - it adds a nice contrast to the rest of the meal.

My only complaint is that the pita bread that comes with the appetizers is not served warm as well. It's a minor issue, but it would make the meal even more enjoyable.

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to try the desserts, as the main dishes are already so filling and delicious. Maybe next time I'll have to save more room for dessert. Overall, Aladdin's was a good choice for a tasty and budget-friendly meal."

The atmosphere of this place is pretty authentic and would bring a sense of warm nostalgia to any Filipino. However, our experience quickly went downhill when they were out of the one thing we came here for - their famous bibingka. We arrived later in the day so we understood, but we decided to grab some food to take back to our hotel instead. The combo plate for my dad was decent, nothing too special but definitely satisfying. But what really frustrated us was when our waitress broke my mom's debit card while she was away and didn't even bother to mention it when she returned it to us. It wasn't until we noticed it ourselves and she had walked away that we found out. It was a small detail, but it just added on to the disappointment of not being able to try their popular dish. Overall, not the best experience and definitely not worth going out of your way for."
1741,"Went there for lunch with 5 coworkers. Nobody liked the food and the atmosphere was horrible. Sat under a TV blaring Chinese news at a table with an off kilter lazy susan that pushed our dishes into our laps. \nThe staff had to be flagged down several times - to bring forks, to fill water, to ask for the check, etc...\nI had the orange chicken which was overly wangy with a cloying citrus sauce and large chunks of orange peel that I accidentally chewed on (and spit out) a couple times. yuck.\n10 bucks (including tax and tip) for chicken, white rice, diet coke, and a headache.\nNot going back."
1742,"I've been trying several different chinese buffets in my area, and EZ Buffet is the only one I've been back to.  It's not much to look at, but I do think the recessed ceilings are nice.  I appreciate that they have several different vegetable offerings instead of just one as other places have.  I especially enjoyed the sauteed cabbage.  I also liked the lo mein, and really really like their hot and sour soup.\n\nI haven't tried the sushi, but their dessert selection is kind of sad.   The second time I went they didn't have any cookies to dip in the tapioca pudding."

My friends and I were eager to try out Shizen for the first time. After hearing rave reviews about their sushi, we were excited to see what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, our experience fell short of our expectations. While sitting at the sushi bar, we were taken care of by Chef Paul who seemed to be the highlight of our evening. His unique sushi creations were truly impressive and definitely the highlight of our meal. However, the rest of the food was a letdown. The sashimi was decent, but the custom rolls were lacking. We had high hopes for the entrees, but they were less than desirable and didn't have the authentic taste we were hoping for. It felt like something was missing, like the love and passion that typically goes into making Italian food. Overall, our experience at Shizen was just okay. We were hoping for more, but unfortunately, it fell short of our expectations. "

I have so many wonderful memories tied to 40th St. Cafe. As a child, my family and I frequented this charming cafe, and it continues to hold a special place in my heart. My mom, a single mother raising two boys, often picked up shifts at the cafe to earn extra money. And when she fell ill, the staff and regulars stepped up and provided meals for my brother and me. It's moments like these that truly showcase the sense of community and family that 40th St. Cafe embodies.

But let's talk about the food. Their homemade dishes are simply unbeatable. Peggy's Pies are a must-try ‚Äì they are hands down the best in town. And if you're a fan of home-cooked meals, this is the place for you. I highly recommend trying their Cobb Salad with their homemade blue cheese dressing ‚Äì it's unlike any blue cheese you've ever tasted. And their Guacamole Burger? Mouthwatering.

I've since moved to Gilbert, so I don't have the chance to visit as often as I'd like. But whenever I'm in the area, 40th St. Cafe is where I'll go. Not just for the delicious food, but also to support a business that goes above and beyond for their customers and community. And let's not forget ‚Äì they participate in the Walk for the Cure every year in honor of my late mother and others who have passed. How could I not support such a kind and giving establishment?

So if you're looking for a place that serves up heartwarming food and has heartwarming people, look no further than 40th St. Cafe. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. "

I recently had the pleasure of hosting a luncheon at the Village Tavern and Trattoria, and while it was a touching and memorable event, I have to say that my overall experience was just average. Don't get me wrong, the restaurant itself is lovely and the staff, including our server Jade, were very friendly and accommodating. But when it came down to the food and atmosphere, I couldn't help but feel like it was nothing special. The menu was a bit limited, with mostly pasta and pizza options, and while they were tasty, I was hoping for a bit more variety.

One highlight was the appetizers, which were delicious and perfectly timed, but unfortunately, the main dishes just didn't stand out to me. I appreciate the effort that was put into creating a special menu for our gathering, especially considering the short notice, but it just didn't wow me like I was hoping it would. And while the patio was a nice touch, I couldn't fully enjoy it due to the noise from the highway nearby.

I will say, the Village Tavern and Trattoria did make our family and friends feel welcome, and the location was convenient for all of us. The setup for the luncheon was well-organized and the staff were attentive throughout the event. But, in comparison to other similar restaurants I've been to, I have to say this one falls short. It's a decent option for a casual gathering, but if you're looking for something truly exceptional, then I would recommend looking elsewhere. Overall, it was a decent experience, but nothing to write home about."
1746,"I no longer frequent the WISCO due to the regulars who think they can harass and threaten visitors. I enjoyed seeing many fantastic bands in their totally inappropriate for live music space, but no lineup has yet to get me back in the door.

I'll go into more details later when I update this review. I just feel like I am there all the time and never impressed. Sometimes there are ok deals and sometimes there are just disappointments like the meat and seafood counter where the selection looks old and not very fresh. I understand that there are not many Italians in Wisconsin but for the love of God.... what major grocery store doesn't carry soppresatta or Genoa salami at the deli counter? The bread at bakery is always fresh at reasonably priced too so that makes up for some of the disappointments."

I recently stayed at this hotel with my husband and unfortunately it was not a pleasant experience. The location was great as it was on the strip and had a good deal, but that is where the positives end. The service was extremely bad, starting with the concierge giving us the wrong room number. We went up to the room and the key didn't work, so we had to go all the way back to request a new one. The room was not as clean as we had hoped, and the carpets were noticeably dirty. I didn't even feel comfortable taking my socks off.  But the biggest disappointment was the casino. The waitresses were slow and had terrible service. The overall atmosphere was not enjoyable, with the renovated rooms still not up to standard. I would suggest looking elsewhere for a hotel on the strip. "

We walked into this store because our corporate company had recommended it for our phone needs. We were greeted by a salesperson, a short-haired woman, who seemed more interested in her own phone than helping us. Despite there being 3 other service agents and only 1 customer, she didn't even bother to look up when we entered. When we mentioned we were sent by our corporate company, she flat out dismissed us, saying it was against their policy. She didn't even put her phone down while saying this, which was a huge red flag. After trying to confirm with our corporate company, she arrogantly stated that we could call all we wanted, as if she didn't care about helping us at all. This was the final straw for us. We called Sprint and they were extremely helpful, resolving our issue immediately. We also made sure to report the terrible customer service we received from the woman with the short hair and piercings. We highly recommend avoiding her at all costs."

After going to Marquee Nightclub for Labor Day Weekend in 2014, I have to say I was pretty disappointed. First off, despite Armin being the DJ, the night was soured by the rude and inconsiderate crowd. I know Magic said it best, but ""Why do you gotta be so RUDE?!"" I ended up stuck in the front of the stage for over two hours because no one would let me through. And my friend who went the night before for Kaskade said it was even worse. It's like people forgot that we're all there to have a good time and enjoy the music. Can we all just learn to be a little more courteous?

I will give props to the security though. They were the only ones who actually helped me out when I was being harassed. Thank you for pulling me out of the crowd and saving me from some creep. I don't know if I'll ever come back for the nightclub after that experience, but I might consider the dayclub.

Speaking of the dayclub, it was a completely different story. Tritional was the DJ and while they may not be as big as Kaskade or Armin, they still put on a great show. And let's not forget the open bar for ladies. I definitely took full advantage of that. Although I do want to remind everyone to be courteous and tip the bartenders, even when the drinks are free. It's just common courtesy.

I also have to give a shoutout to the head of security at the dayclub. I managed to lose my wallet and he handled everything in a professional manner. And thanks to a kind soul, my wallet was eventually turned in. So while I may not come back for the nightclub, I will definitely be back for the dayclub. Overall, the experience was a bit of a rollercoaster, but I'll give it a ""maybe"" for next time."

The wait staff is knowledgeable, the wine list is excellent (though very expensive, with very few mid-level options), and the appetizers were delicious - we tried the veal cheek.\n\nThe issue here was the main courses.

I had a mixed experience at this doctor's office. While I was impressed with the doctor's expertise and kind demeanor, the clerical department left me feeling frustrated. They made several mistakes with my personal information, including mixing up my first and last name, getting my phone number completely wrong, and even getting my birthday wrong. As someone who works in the medical field, I know how crucial it is to have accurate information for insurance purposes. And when I brought this up to the staff, instead of taking it seriously, they laughed at me. It was unprofessional and showed a lack of competence. I hope the clerical department can improve their processes to match the level of care provided by the doctor. While I appreciated the doctor, I'm not sure if I would come back again due to the issues with the clerical department. "

At first glance, this gelato shoppe seemed like a promising new addition to the neighborhood. The colorful storefront and friendly staff drew us in for our first visit. We have to admit, the gelato was pretty delicious and we couldn't resist going back a second time in the same week. The staff even recognized us and remembered our order from the first visit - talk about impressive service! They were also happy to offer samples and make suggestions for flavor combinations that would satisfy our sweet tooth. As a chocolate lover, I couldn't resist trying out their chocolate hazelnut gelato and it tasted just like those heavenly Ferrero Rocher chocolates. And let's not forget about their dark chocolate and coconut flavors - put them together and you'll be transported to Almond Joy heaven without any of the guilt. Plus, we appreciated the small gesture of offering us a glass of water while we enjoyed our gelato. However, there were a few things that could have made our experience even better. The gelato was a bit on the pricey side and we were disappointed to find out that they didn't offer any discount for purchasing multiple scoops. Also, the seating area was a bit cramped and could use some more tables and chairs. Overall, it was a decent experience but there is definitely room for improvement. We're hoping that with time, this gelato shoppe will iron out the kinks and become a go-to spot for delicious cold treats."

I have to share my unfortunate experience at this restaurant. I had high hopes when I saw the bustling crowd inside, but little did I know, it was a sign of things to come. The wait time for our food was over an hour, and once it finally arrived, it was obvious that the kitchen staff was not prepared to handle the rush. My onion rings were left sitting for quite some time before I had to speak up and have them taken off the bill. To top it off, my daughter ordered a Caesar salad which apparently was not on the menu according to our server, even though it clearly was. Such a simple dish, yet they couldn't even get that right. 

The only saving grace was the food that did make it to our table was decent. The po boy had a nice crispy fish and fresh slaw, but was a bit dry. Thankfully, the tartar sauce helped fix that. The Chicago dog tasted like something you would get from a hot dog stand, and the Philly cheese was the best of the bunch with generous portions. However, the slow service and lack of attention to detail from the staff left a bad taste in my mouth. 

It's unfortunate that this place has so much potential with its prime location, good food, and nice decor, but it all goes to waste due to poor management and lazy employees. Several other customers even walked out because of the long wait time. It's time for the owners to step up and teach their staff how to handle a busy restaurant. As for me, I will not be returning and will advise others to steer clear as well. It's not worth the hassle when there are plenty of other options serving great food and providing excellent service in the area."

I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, especially since I've been to the original location in NY and loved it. But unfortunately, my experience at this location just didn't live up to my expectations.

The atmosphere was lackluster and reminded me more of a Denny's than a nice restaurant. The lighting was dim and honestly, a bit annoying. It took me quite a bit of effort to get the attention of a waiter/waitress/hostess to even get my check. And once I got it, it took even longer to receive my bill.

I decided to try their pastrami sandwich, but it was just okay. Nothing special or memorable about it. It tasted like any other pastrami sandwich you can find at any random deli. Maybe I had my hopes up too high for this place, but the lack of a line outside should have been a clear sign that it wasn't a hit in Vegas.

I don't think I'll be returning to this location and I definitely won't be recommending it to anyone. The sandwich wasn't even worth taking a picture of for social media. Overall, a disappointing experience that didn't live up to its potential."

We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis.

We happened upon Vin Santo on a bustling Friday evening, just days before my friend's marathon. Despite the wait of 45 minutes, the owner, a sweet English woman, went out of her way to make us feel welcome and even tried to speed up our wait time by asking other customers if they wouldn't mind waiting a little longer.

But unfortunately, the food didn't live up to our expectations. While portion sizes were generous, the quality just wasn't there. The Salsiccia Rossa that I ordered was supposed to come with pasta, but there was so much Italian sausage that the noodles were left feeling neglected. My fellow diners also found their dishes to be subpar, and we left feeling underwhelmed.

The decor was quite lovely and clean, and the staff was friendly and attentive. But despite these positives, the disappointing food was enough to make us consider not returning. It's a shame, as we had high hopes for Vin Santo based on its reputation. But it seems that things may have changed since its earlier days and expansion.

Unfortunately, they didn't have my size in the 120s but she did offer to give me a business card and told me to call and check stock every so often.\n\nAfter thinking about it for awhile I decided I would maybe try the pigalle 100s so we headed into the shop again at the forum shops. When we walked in it was completely different associates than I saw the first time I went it. First of all, let me say that the ladies that work there don't even look like they work there. I was admiring the pigalle 100s for like a good 10 mins when someone FINALLY asked me for help. I asked her for my size and she went back to look but she didn't even come back to tell me. So I asked another associate if the had the sizes and she came back and told me they didn't. They are very snobby there and will only help you if you look like you have money. The girl next to me had a salvatore ferragamo shopping bag and they were helping her like no other. I wanted to try one more size to see how it felt and I asked the lady and she said the smallest size they had was a 35, but i was asking for a 36... that made absolutely no sense.

This place claims to offer car wash and oil change services, but beware, they apparently also offer a side of theft. I made the mistake of leaving my $80 E-Cig battery in the car while I waited for my services to be completed. Big mistake. By the time I got back to my car, it was gone. Lesson learned, never trust a business with your valuables. I will never be returning to this place, except maybe to give them a piece of my mind and potentially a black eye. Trust me, their services don't make up for the missing items and shattered trust. Do yourself a favor and find a different car wash and oil change service."
1764,"This the worst sign company in the valley.  I literally waited months for my signs to come in ...all this and they charged my credit card long before I received my signs.  Once the signs came in they were damaged and the whole order was not there.  I was left high and dry for Open House signs after Josh said he would have them for weeks!  I don't know how this con artist sleeps at night!  Josh is the biggest bullshitter out there!  He says he can deliver the moon and delivers nothing.  I really don't know how they stay in business.  I have learned my lesson with these guys.  Take my advice; there are a lot of sign companies out there, DONOT use this company!!!  I wish I had looked on Yelp before I placed my order; I would have never used this company!"
1765,"Disappointed is the only way to describe my encounter with Curry in the Box.  I purchased a coupon from Get My Perks and I tried to used it the second day from the last that it expired.  Unfortunately I did not read the fine print very carefully, it said dine in only.  I had already ordered ahead and had it ready for carry out.  When I got there the cashier pointed out to me that the coupon did say dine in only, she then got a manager for me.  Even after pleading with the manager, he insisted that he would not honor the coupon.  He said that the coupon was designed to get new people to come in the door.  I explained that I was a new customer and had never been there before and that I wouldn't have come in if it hadn't been for the coupon, so it worked.  If I had liked it I would be coming back as a return customer.  Still he was insisted he would not honor the coupon.  He said if I would like they would un bag it and let me sit in the dining room and eat it ????? What the heck!  My husband was at home waiting for me so I was not about to eat it at a restaurant by myself.  In the end the manager decided to let me walk out and not accept the coupon on food that was already made, bagged and ready to go.  He told me I could come back some other time to use the coupon, even though I already explained that it expired the next day.  Even though I really wanted to try the food at Curry in the Box I decided that I would not be a customer now or in the future due to the complete lack of respect and rudeness that I was treated with. Get My Perks graciously credited my account the money that I spent on the coupon for future use."
1766,"This place was so busy!  Because this part of town needed a new/additional breakfast place.  It's not fancy but it was new, cute, clean.  And we loved the food.  Service was great even on a very busy Sunday.  5 of us ate for cheap and we loved it.  It didn't take long to get seated either because this is a decent sized place.  I definitely would recommend it, and I will go back, even if they are busy."
1767,"

I was really excited to try out this restaurant after hearing great things about the atmosphere and food. However, our experience was ruined by the terrible service. It took us forever to even be seated, as the hostess seemed more interested in her phone call than helping us. Our server was slow and unattentive, taking over 15 minutes just to acknowledge our presence. It wasn't until we closed our menus that she finally came to take our order, which took another 20 minutes. And when our food finally arrived, it was all at once - the appetizer and pizza, completely ruining our dining experience. 

Despite the good food, the service was just too much to handle. It's a shame because I really enjoyed the pizza, but it's not worth putting up with bad service. And to make matters worse, the restaurant was mostly empty and there seemed to be plenty of staff. The lunch specials are tempting but don't be fooled, you'll never make it out in an hour. Overall, the service ruined what could have been a great dining experience. Save yourself the frustration and find somewhere else to eat."
1768," ugly hostess

I decided to check out this restaurant on a lazy Sunday afternoon by myself. When I first walked in, I was immediately greeted by a snotty hostess who seemed too busy to give me any attention. After waiting for a while, I finally had to snag my own dirty menu from a nearby table covered in crumbs and food debris. As I sat down to look at the menu, a rude waitress barked at me, telling me that her section was closed and I couldn't sit there. Frustrated and disappointed, I left the restaurant and was so annoyed that I threw a dirty napkin on the ground on my way out. As I was leaving, I noticed a group of photographers and press trying to get an explanation and possibly even take some photos. But at that point, I just wanted to move on and find somewhere else to eat. This place was a major letdown and definitely not worth the time or money. Next time, I'll go somewhere where I can actually enjoy my food without any fuss or horrible service. What a stupid and lame experience."
1769,"

As I walked into this lively and bustling restaurant, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the endless options on the menu. From salads to paninis to pizza, it seemed like they had it all. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first. After all, can a place really do all of these dishes justice?

My first visit was for breakfast, and I have to say, I was a little disappointed. The Jersey girl sandwich I ordered was decent, but a bit watery for my taste. And to my surprise, it even came with cabbage, which was not listed as an ingredient on the menu. While my husband enjoyed his Zuni burrito, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by the lack of flavor in our dishes.

However, I have to give credit where credit is due. Despite the chaotic atmosphere, the staff remained organized and our food was delivered in a timely manner. And while the coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice were satisfactory, I couldn't help but feel like the prices were a bit steep.

Overall, I would say this place has potential, but it didn't quite knock my socks off. I may come back to try their pizza, but for now, I'm not in a rush to return. While the food was decent, it wasn't anything special that I couldn't find elsewhere. With some adjustments and additions to their menu, this place could really stand out in the sea of breakfast and brunch options. Until then, I'll give it a solid 3 stars."
1770,"It's quite quick typically... However, it takes a year and a day to receive a beverage during lunch when only two people are working at the juice bar. It was crazy to notice how long it took them to make one \""green giant\"" juiced beverage. It took 5 minutes . I came to experience something other than office coffee but it's not particularly helpful to spend my lunch waiting"
1771,"Stayed here just for a night when I was in town to see NIN at the US Airways Center. The price was super cheap and HGI's are my favorite brand of Hilton so it was a no brainer.\n \nPros: shuttle to and from airport. A block away from public transit (the shuttle will take you/pick you up there if you ask.) Coupons for a free well drink if you're Diamond (I'm guessing Gold too but don't quote me). I didn't use it but it's a nice gesture.\n\nCons: not much around the hotel so you need to have a car or be content with transit to get food, etc.)\n\nI'd definitely stay here again if I was in Phoenix for an event or if I was stuck in Phoenix due to a mishap at the airport."

I've been a loyal customer at this Starbucks location for quite some time now, but unfortunately, I can only give them one star. I have had multiple issues with my orders, from them never getting my order right to having to repeat myself at least twice through the drive-thru every single day. And even when they do manage to get my order correct, there's always something off about the taste. It's so frustrating to pay for the same drink every day and constantly be disappointed. 

But wait, there's more. The drive-thru wait time is absolutely ridiculous. It doesn't matter if there are only a few cars in line or ten, you can always count on it taking at least 10 minutes to get through. And let me tell you, living in Southern Highlands, there aren't many options for a quick caffeine fix. But if there was a Coffee Bean right next door, I can guarantee I would be there instead. 

But the final straw was when I had to deal with some of the most unprofessional and disrespectful staff I have ever encountered. I had someone literally walk away from me as I was mid-sentence, I was told to go pick up my own car after not wanting to trade it in, and when I asked to speak to a manager, I was dismissed and told I was being ridiculous. It's clear that customer service is not a priority here. 

Overall, my experience at this Starbucks has been consistently disappointing and I can confidently say that I will be taking my daily coffee run elsewhere. Don't waste your time or money at this location."
1773,"Ten members of my family made reservations for Sunday brunch today for mother's day! Horrible experience for service and especially the food! First off for 35 dollars per person their hardly was any food out, and what was out was dried out and hardly edible. So right off the bat 3 people in our party decided against doing the brunch because of how bad it looked so they ordered from the menu. I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that. Worst part was we told the waitress how we felt and I'm sure she could see how displeased we were and didn't even offer to make things right...so after 230.00 Bill we left hungry and angry. By the way at least 2 different customers were nodding their head and felt how we did...do yourself a favor pay 10 bucks more and hit up the Phoenician for mother's day brunch."
1774,"You get a lot of food for the price, but the food doesn't deliver. We ordered the pepperoni pretzel appetizer thinking it was going to be oven baked pretzels with pepperoni served with the cheese dip. What we got was pretzel rods from a bag with cold pepperoni slices wrapped around them. The cheese dip was good but was cold by the time it made it to the table. Major disappointment. We kept an open mind for the main entrees. My friend got the bacon Mac n cheese burger with the house fries. The burger was huge but thin and didn't have a lot of Mac n cheese on it. The fries were dusted with seasoning and were decent. It was ok but the burger and truffle fries at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant Burgr were A LOT better. I had the Caesar salad which was enormous and by far the beat dish of  the meal. The salad was freshly tossed, cold and the croutons were delicious. Overall, a lack luster experience that failed to meet expectations."

At first glance, this place seemed promising. The waiting room was clean and welcoming, the doctor seemed knowledgeable and the promise of finding the perfect solution for my migraines was alluring. However, as soon as I stepped into the examination room, my enthusiasm quickly dissipated. The wait time was ridiculous and it only got worse as I sat in discomfort, surrounded by outdated magazines, for over an hour. And once I finally got to see the doctor, I realized it was all for naught. She dismissed my concerns and insisted on prescribing me a different ""cocktail"" of meds, despite my history of trying every possible medication for migraines. It was as if she had no interest in listening to the patient and was following a strict protocol instead. And to make matters worse, this wasn't just a one-time occurrence. I experienced the same absurd wait time on multiple visits. Clearly, this place prioritizes numbers over patient care. Save yourself the trouble and find a doctor who actually cares about your well-being."
1776,I love their food but the service sucked didn't get waited on until 10mins later while I waited I over herd them B.S.ing in the back then when I did get waited on the person who took my order was a smarta** and made comments that u don't make very unprofessional
1777,Good property that offers a great escape when on business without the generic hotel feel. The setting is fabulous and it's located in good proximity to the airport. Tip: Be sure to request an upgraded room. Service has always been great but the dinner menu is really quite disappointing and the wine selection is even worse!
1778,"Overall, Menchie's in a decent fro-yo option in the Dilworth area. \n\nPlenty of flavors to try. Most are sweet with only 2 tart options when I visited. The flavors do rotate. I liked the consistency, not too creamy and not icy.  Some of the flavors definitely made me think soft serve and not fro yo... Good? Bad? Undecided. But I noticed that it melted really fast. By the time I dispensed it into my cup, put the toppings on, and paid for it, there was a decent melted pool in the bottom of my cup. That made me a little sad. They had some samples of their fresh made waffle cones/bowls. Delish. I would definitely recommend their waffle products!\n\nI teeter totter between liking self-serve vs. full serve fro yo places. Menchie's is a self-serve joint. Which means: \na) You can sample as many flavors as you want. Just grab the small paper sample cups on the counter. \nb) You can put all 12 flavors in one cup if you so desire\nc) You can top away and decorate to your hearts desire.\n\nBut I must warn you, self serve places definitely have their negatives. \na) So, when you pay by the ounce you gotta be careful how much you put in that cup. They only offer one size cup, which is quite large(!) and easy to fill if you aren't swift handed with the dispensing lever. The toppings bar is quite dangerous as well... Fill up your cup too much and you may be walking away with an $8 cup of fro yo. My cup was around $5 and I felt like I went pretty easy filling up the cup. It was maybe 1/2 full. \nb) Toppings are also self-serve... I try not to think of the bogger picking little fingers that have been all over those scoops. But hey, some germs never killed anyone right... think of it as free immune system training! \nc) The toppings bar options weren't that great/healthy. They had plenty of dry toppings - crushed cookies, cereal, gummi bears, choco chips, and many other hfcs laden options. But I thought the fresh fruit area was lacking. The fruit I saw was cut into large, unappealing chunks and some of it didn't look all that fresh. \n \nWhile not my favorite fro yo joint in the QC, it does deserve a mention. I like this location better than other Menchie's locations I've visited (it's a franchise). Sign up for a Smileage card if you are a frequent visitor."

I recently visited Charlotte's Farm to Fork, Organic Pizzeria for the second time and once again, I was pleasantly surprised by their gluten-free options. As someone who struggles to find tasty options for my dietary restrictions, I was thrilled to see that they not only offer gluten-free pizza, but also have dairy-free options with vegan cheese. This just proves how dedicated they are to providing fresh, locally-sourced ingredients for all types of diets. 
But, let me not forget to mention the taste! The pizza was absolutely delicious and loaded with fresh toppings, making it a guilt-free indulgence. However, I have to say that the prices are a bit steep. While I appreciate the quality of the food, I'm not sure I would be willing to pay $12 for a veggie pizza and an extra $5 for waffle fries again. 
On top of that, my friends who had a groupon had a bit of a struggle trying to redeem it. Our waitress seemed a bit uninterested in honoring it and eventually they just gave up and paid the full price. Maybe this is something the restaurant can work on in the future. 
Overall, I would recommend Charlotte's Farm to Fork for their delicious organic pizza and accommodating menu options, but just be aware of their prices and potential issues with using a groupon. "
1780,"Irish version of Hooters?\n\nI guess this is the type of place people will go to see young college girls in skimpy clothes, not necessarily for the food. I went here after a baseball game to grab some food and some beer. We ordered their wings and garlic fries to share. The wings were just horrible. We asked for a mixture of their hot sauce and their sweet and spicy sauce and grilled. The waitress totally commended us for that decision and said it was sooo good. And it wasn't. It was TERRIBLE. The wings were so greasy and the sauce was incredibly lackluster. We left most of them on the plate and believe me, that NEVER happens with me and  food.  The garlic fries....meh. I really think they could use some more garlic but maybe that is just my personal preference. \n\nAs far as the service, the girls were very friendly. But when our food was set down, they did not bring two little plates and we were missing silver ware. We kept trying to grab someone's attention and it took forever. When we needed our check, our waitress was nowhere to be seen. \n\nSome of their beer cocktails looked pretty interesting. So now I know that this place is mainly for drinking and I will only go again if the people I am with want to go there for the novelty. \n\nThe view of downtown from the second story is very nice!"

I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided.

Great option for off-season shopping, but be prepared for some chaos. The recently changed layout has definitely allowed for more traffic flow, but it can still feel cramped at peak hours. I recommend going early on weekends for a chance at a ground-floor parking spot in the busy Metropolitan parking deck. Despite its convenient location, I doubt the new Harris Teeter down the street will sway me from coming here for my grocery needs. They have everything I need, except for clam juice. Plus, the people-watching opportunities at this store are always interesting. Although, one time I did witness the karaoke DJ dedicate a song to his mother for Mother's Day. Talk about unexpected entertainment. Just beware that the bartenders here tend to snack on food and fruit behind the bar, which may be off-putting for some. Also, the barstools are a bit unevenly padded, so make sure to choose your seat carefully. Overall, this is a decent dive bar-esque option, just don't expect perfection."

Let me start off by saying, I am a firm believer in giving credit where credit is due. However, after my experience at this BBQ joint, I am left questioning the standards of good BBQ in Memphis. I had high hopes for my takeout order of ribs and a BBQ pork sandwich, but let's just say I was sorely disappointed.

First of all, the portion size was pitiful. For the hefty price of $30, I expected to at least have enough food for a couple of meals. But alas, I was left with barely enough meat to top a cracker. And don't even get me started on the sandwich. Not only was the bun stale, but there was barely any meat to begin with. As someone who takes their BBQ seriously, I was appalled.

But perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the meal was the onion rings. I had heard great things about them, but unfortunately, they arrived cold and were inedible. It's like they didn't even care about the quality of their food.

Speaking of quality, let's talk about the bill. I understand that location factors into pricing, but I refuse to believe that rent in this area justifies charging an arm and a leg for subpar BBQ. Trust me, you'd be better off going to a chain restaurant for better quality and more affordable prices.

In conclusion, I had high hopes for this BBQ spot, but in the end, I was left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed. As much as I hate to say it, Vegas needs a better BBQ joint. So take my advice and steer clear of this place. Consider yourself warned."
1785,"This store destroyed the stellar 8 year customer service streak with Apple.  From mentioning multiple times you can reserve phones on launch day in line to eventually being told they don't do reservations, calling and being told I would be called back then eventually having phones setup not being asked which line is for which phone and of course they are setup wrong.\n\nBig iPhone launch day shenanigans, avoid Apple Store on launch day and for weeks afterward. They seemingly hire hipster temp employees whose job is to be a hipster, make you happy aka buying mood and get you out the door."

On first glance, I thought this place was going to be a hit. The concept of all kinds of meatballs, with different toppings and sides seemed like a unique and delicious idea. So I was excited to try it out for lunch. However, my experience here was far from satisfying.

First of all, the ambience is nice and welcoming, but that was the only positive thing about this place. The meatballs, which are supposed to be their specialty, were extremely disappointing. I tried the pork and turkey options, and both were dry and flavorless. It was as if they were reheated from a previous day's batch. And the sauces, which are supposed to make the meatballs stand out, were also lackluster and unappealing.

Another issue I had was with my mac and cheese. Now, I love mac and cheese, and I was looking forward to trying it with the government cheese as it sounded unique and tasty. But to my disappointment, it was bland and cold, as if it had been sitting out for a while. I could barely even taste the cheese.

And don't even get me started on the service. The staff seemed indifferent and uninterested in their customers. When I brought up my concerns about the food, their reaction was basically a shrug and a mumbled apology. That kind of attitude is unacceptable, especially from a place that prides itself on its food.

Overall, I was extremely disappointed with my experience at this place. The promising concept falls flat when it comes to execution. I will not be returning anytime soon, and I definitely would not recommend it to anyone else. Save your money and go somewhere else for a satisfying meal. "

I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, the food was decent ‚Äì the mushroom pizza and shrimp risotto were highlights ‚Äì but on the other hand, the prices left me feeling disappointed. For $160 for three people, I expected more than just ""decent"" food. The grilled sea bass over greens was nothing to write home about and the pasta dish with mushrooms was just average. It's a shame because the wait staff was very kind and accommodating, even moving our table to a quieter area. However, the noise level wasn't the only thing that was off ‚Äì the drinks were underwhelming as well. It's a shame they didn't have a full bar despite the option being listed. Overall, I can't say I'll be returning anytime soon."
1788,"Blech! Eek! Yuck! Went here last Saturday with my compadres, Myles M, Kristin S and a few others. We had been day drinking substantially and still thought the food was barely edible. Having grown up in California, I am completely aware of the variety of \""Mexican food\"" that exists. I've had true authentic food with cactus, Americanized Tex Mex like they serve at places like Chevy's and drive-through places like Filiberto's, and I'm ok with eating at the less authentic end of the spectrum. That being said, I still expect my food to be made with decent ingredients, to be flavorful and to be a good value for the money. And the food at Macayo's is none of those. \n\nThe special shrimp burrito we got had a decently spicy sauce, but the tortilla was soggy and greasy. The Spanish rice was the worst I've ever had. My friend's \""grilled veggie\"" fajitas were overcooked, mushy, STEAMED veggies like carrots and broccoli. What a curse to be a vegetarian in this joint! The house salsa was OK but I've had better from a jar. \n\nThe only saving grace of this place was that it was crowded and lively on a Saturday night (always something I miss dining in Central Phoenix). The pitcher of margaritas we got was also decent and not too sweet. \n\nSorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review. Macayo's sucks and I'm not afraid to say it."
1789,"Worst experience!!! We sat down and our host had to come over 3 times before our waitress even came over. And come to find out the hostess was our server. Apparently some miscommunication between the staff. The place was dead and another couple that had arrived 10 minutes after us got an appetizer before our order was even taken. They were over staffed. We could see four servers stranding around talking. It took almost 40 minutes for us to get our food and it was terrible! Paid the bill and got out of there. My boyfriend spoke with the manager who was outside on his cell phone and he managed our concerns very poorly. Didn't even offer to take care of part of he meal or offer us some sort of deal to come back. Terrible service, terrible food. Never going back again!"

The selection at this place is extremely disappointing. But what's even worse is the terrible service. I've been here a few times now and have never received any sort of helpful or knowledgeable assistance, which is honestly what I expect from a Home Depot. The only reason I even continue to come here is because they have a slightly bigger selection of potted plants than the other big box stores.

But my last visit was the final straw. I asked for help from not one, but two different associates to try and find some specific seeds. And to say they were rude and unhelpful would be an understatement. They both just shrugged and told me the seeds were in alphabetical order, as if I was supposed to magically find them on my own. When I pointed out that the seeds were not even remotely in alphabetical order, one of the associates actually tried to argue with me. I mean, seriously? And when he realized he was wrong, he just shrugged and said ""well, that's as good as it can be"" before walking away.

Not only did the associates have no idea if they even had the seeds I was looking for, but they also had no clue where they would be located. It's clear that they were just completely uninterested in helping me. Their lack of knowledge or willingness to assist customers is just unacceptable.

I will never step foot in this place again. The selection is not worth the terrible service you will receive. Save yourself the trouble and go to a different home improvement store. This one is a definite FAIL."
1791,"Meh. I didn't find this pub to be anything special, but that might be because it was cold and rainy when we visited, so we didn't take advantage of any of the outdoor seating.\n\nDrink prices were on a par with other places in the area, but really, there are plenty of other places to drink that are more interesting and/or charming. \n\nThere was nothing really WRONG with the Beehive, it was fine to stop in for a midafternoon drink and relax for awhile, but there are certainly better places to visit, so I wouldn't be a repeat customer."

I've been a loyal customer at this restaurant for years now, but my recent visit left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't even finish my meal without feeling nauseous from the overly loud music blasting through the cramped dining area. And don't even get me started on the prices - I could have gone to a drive-thru and ordered the same mediocre food for a fraction of the cost. To make matters worse, the staff seemed anything but happy to be there. Despite their constant repetition of the words ""orange chicken,"" my experience was far from excellent. I don't know what others see in this place, but for me, it's a hard pass. Maybe if they turned down the music and focused more on the quality of their food and service, I might give it another chance. But as it stands, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. In summary: orange chicken, orange chicken, orange chicken, avoid."

But the hour wait after that to get food was awful...  especially when you are only getting a couple of tacos. Very tiny tacos at that. Then it took and another 30 min to get the check and pay our bill - no bueno Between our small party, we had duck, snapper, shrimp, steak, lamb and chicken tacos. All were 'meh', nothing to come back for. My friend said the lamb was good, but not something going out of his way for. The specialty drinks were equally unimpressive, and the very average house margarita was still ten bucks. Just for me, 3 tacos and 2 drinks was 37 bucks, for food that was tiny and nothing special to boot! \n\nThe design of the building was very cool, well done ambiance (but some really douchey people congregating at the bar who wouldn't move out of the isle as I am trying to walk by with my 4 month old sleeping baby.)\n\nThe tequila list looked impressive, but I am not going to spend $200 on a single shot of tequila. Again, everything was in place for a cool dining experience - then the food and service got in the way. (Although either the manager or owner who sat us was very kind and accommodating)"

I don't think the A/C filter had ever been changed, chunks of dirt were falling out. I almost took it out myself. My room was super small, but they told me about this at check in. I didn't mind. The safe was gross, covered in all sorts of things being adjacent to the side of the bed. I was on Floor 19 and the noise from Fremont was not all that bad. But the noise of the old clunky A/C, although working well, and the constant elevator noise (and people waiting on the elevator) was pretty loud. Saturday night was the noisiest. Also, Sunday morning the whole top floor reeked of burnt fish..maintenance was spraying stuff to try and mask it but no go. Also, the smoke and other smells from outside your room, do get in. There is something really wrong with the HVAC here or something. But I would stay here again for the price."

This airline was my last resort for a cheap flight to Las Vegas and I immediately regretted it. The plane was so small, I felt like a giant trying to fit into a child's toy. I was constantly bumping my knees against the seat in front of me and the cramped space made me feel claustrophobic. To make matters worse, there was no complimentary food or drinks on the flight, so be prepared to pay a high price for mediocre snacks and drinks. The only redeeming factor was the option to upgrade to a ""big front seat"", but even then, it was just an uncomfortable recliner seat. I didn't plan on being comfortable during the flight, but I didn't expect to feel this cramped and uncomfortable. I would never choose to fly Spirit again, even in a pinch. It's not worth the discomfort and lack of amenities."
1798,"We used to eat here quite a bit, but the quality has gone down. The chicken was always moist and fresh, but the last five or so times it has been dried out and flavorless. We usually order 'to-go', but the last time we ate in I was surprised by the lack of cleanliness. I'd like to see them clean up and learn to serve chicken safely without it tasting like saw dust."
1799,"Station Casinos has a lot of great properties in Vegas. But I'm not a fan of Santa Fe Station. It's got a layout that's just odd. It's kinda cramped, it's kinda blah, and it's not really the kind of place I felt comfortable in. Sure it's got theaters, it's got a Cabo, it's got Revolver, but the core casino is about as ho-hum as it gets. \n\nUnless you want to visit one of the previously mentioned side attractions the best view of Santa Fe Station is from the 95 with the speedo showing 65 mph and your foot nowhere near the brake pedal."
1800,too easy. DO NOT eat here. \n\nits like a big buffet full of nothing. the old asian inspired theme was shabby. and the food. nothing near the asian style. break fast was terrible. and the only thing that was slightly edible was pizza. they ran out and never replenished it. i thought this was a buffet. however. the desserts... were total embarrassment of that entire category. my mud pie was not even muddy. it was just a chunk of dirt that has already settled 24 hours AFTER the rain. done.\n\nno. don't do it.

I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a restaurant while exploring the city. As someone who is not a vegetarian, I was hesitant at first, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance! This is not your average Indian restaurant with the usual chicken curry dishes - instead, it offers a unique and delicious taste of South Indian cuisine.

The atmosphere of the place may not be fancy, but the service is warm and welcoming, thanks to the owner who goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. And the food, oh the food! It's not your typical Indian fare, but it's full of interesting flavors and spices that will leave your taste buds dancing.

Although I've been here four times in the last two months, I have to admit that the offerings can be a bit limited. I wish there were more options on the menu. However, the quality of the food has been consistently good every time I've been here.

Overall, this place is worth a try, even for non-vegetarians like myself. The owner's warm hospitality and the unique South Indian dishes make it a standout among the many Indian restaurants in the city. I may not be rushing back here anytime soon, but I wouldn't mind returning if someone suggests it. A solid choice for a flavorful and interesting meal. "

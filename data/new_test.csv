"We experienced overpriced and underwhelming entrees that included the smallest portioned and most watery Seafood Rissoto with the tiniest of muscles and clams we've ever encountered. The Sea Bass was dominated by the taste of olive oil, although a quality piece of fish, and was too small for the price. Our appetizers, Tomato salad and Endive and Beets salad, were pretty good - especially the former. It took too long for entres to arrive while we had to remind the server about our second and side dish. Don't expect to see a wide beer selection. We won't go back.",1
"This place was packed and gave me the impression that we were in for a treat. However, the folks eating there must have been heavy smokers because their taste buds had to gone. That's right this place was a solid OK. I can't believe the yelp team couldn't identify average food! The salad was something you buy at the grocery store in a bag. As for the meatballs, it tasted as though they had been made 3 days ago and simply heated. They tasted old and manufactured like something you would eat at a potluck for retired people. The best part of the dinner was the wine. Bottom line, if you want a place that isn't going to break the bank and you are craving Fazoli's, go to Nora's on W. Flamingo. If you are looking for a good Italian meal on the west side . . . try Mastrioni's.",2
"Yelp map is incorrect.  Location is on the West side of the 101 at Union Hills, and literally overlooks the southbound exit ramp from the 101.  \n\nWhat the hell is it with the stupid Kokopelli theme?  This was somewhat cool for home and restaurant design maybe... 15 years ago or so.  But no, Arizona pizza has resurrected it.\n\nPizza is rather average, as are the appetizers.  Seems to attract the after work happy hour crowd and otherwise isn't really a place that you yearn to visit in any other context.  There are too many other good pizza options.",2
"I went with some friends to watch some sunday football. Here's the long & short of it: The wings are fine, not fantastic. That was actually kind of disappointing. I know a lot of people like boneless wings, so if that is your fancy, you will probably be happy! I was impressed by how many beers they had on tap. \n\nThe service wasn't seamless, but I know this is a new location. I'm not eager to return, but if you're in the area or want to watch & football games at once - this is a good place to do it!",2
"4 stars for the ambiance, 2 stars for the food. I loved the fact that the games here are free and the place has a cool vibe. I ordered the teriyaki chicken wings.  It didn't seem very fresh even though they used a good quality product. The wings were also caked in a very thick, ultra sweet sauce. The drinks are reasonably priced and served cold. The music here is a little bit weird, kinda like stuff they play at Pure or The Bank. What is really great is that all the games here are free. If I was 10 years old I would probably be peeing in my pants. I mean, I am able to beat the ol school X-men game! If I tried to do that at a regular arcade, it would probably cost me 20 dollars in quarters! I might return here for the games and drinks but wouldn't come back here for the food.",2
"No. No. No.\n\nCame in a few days ago for a full set of acrylics. Sat down at a manicure station and the chic proceeded to finish polishing her toes before starting my treatment. Didn't even wash her hands. When I asked her if she minded to wash her hands first she rolled her eyes and did as i asked. I should have run then...\nI asked for them super short. being a bartender i cant have long nails. it took her 3 tries to actually finally get them where i wanted them.\nI put in my head phones and relaxed. They came out decent. not the best def not the worst... until the following day\nI wake up only to find my nails had already lifted. When i showered that morning my hair kept getting stuck in them. This isn't supposed to happen for at least 2-3 weeks after... not then next day.\nWhen i went back the \""manager\"" just said no refunds and that was that. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!! \nI have yet to find a great nail salon in the mountains edge area. If you have any suggestions please send them my way :)",0
"went last friday with a friend. bartender was very rude. my friend asked for a black and tan. then he asked her if she knew how to make one. she stopped in her tracks and looked at him and said, you've got to be kidding me. then i asked her if their corned beef was good, and she said, well this is an irish bar, so of course it's good. corned beef was too salty, cabbage was bland, and so were the potatoes. when we asked for the check, we gave her a bogo entree coupon. she looked at us and said, you can't use that now because it's happy hour. i said, well, the entrees are full price and we did have several drinks. she said, i have been in this business for 15 years and that's the way it is. i wish i knew her name, but she is short, with black eyeliner. she was so rude and surely doesn't know about customer service. my friend went into the men's room and he said they had an attendant, shocking. it's a bar, not an upscale hotel. we will never go back. if you want great Irish fare, skeptical chemyst is the place to go, and they know how to treat their customers. AND the black and tan was not made correctly. what she made was a half and half. you can't make a black and tan with Harp beer. so sad that she didn't know that. oh but wait, SHE has been in the business for 15 years, so I guess, this 100% Irish patron doesn't know anything. Get it together McFadden's...you should tell your servers that they are there for the customers, not the other way around.",0
"The Good: The food here is really good and unique. We had some really good fish dishes, including octopus, the barbounya and tuna. They all tasted really fresh and were very nicely presented. We ordered 9 dishes (see \""The Ugly\"" below) and I thought that perhaps 6/9 were very delicious.\n\nThe Bad: The setup is very strange. We reserved a table for 3 and we were seated at a bar like table. My friend was seated at the corner so it made it awkward for her to talk to both of us. I much prefer sitting at a table where I can talk to my friends face to face.\n\nThe Ugly: The price!!! As you can tell from the pictures, these dishes are teeny tiny! This restaurant is tapas style, which means you need to order at least 2-3 dishes/person to feel even remotely satisfied. Yet the price here for one dish is comparable to other regular restaurants. We were three girls last night and we ordered 9 tapas to split among us. We each had perhaps 2-3 glasses of wine and we shared two desserts. At the end, the bill for each was $100 (including tip)! \n\nI had a fun time, but I will not be back.",2
"The Orange Chicken I ordered arrived swimming in sauce, and it was a bit too sweet for my taste.  It appears they have resolved any issues with their rice, and overall I would recommend this restaurant to someone wanting to find Chinese/American food in Surprise.  Not entirely authentic Chinese by any means, but probably as good as any out here in the far NW valley.  Good if you want to stick close to home, and ample parking.",1
"Mediocre at best.  This place is a wonderful example of American cuisine gone wrong.  When a restaurant relies on salt and mayonnaise as the staple flavor profile, the food is well, boring (i.e. Chipotle Mayo).\n\nRed Robin is a burgers and fries type place, fried everything.  Fried everything should be DELICIOUS!  What is missing?\n\nThe presentation of all the dishes is fine, it is the utter lack of flavor that was so disappointing.  Had a burger and onion rings, and while there was nothing particularly wrong with it, it was completely forgettable.\n\nThe atmosphere is very corporate.\n\nThe service is designed to be good, but falls flat, again too corporate (waiter virtually up your ass when you don't need him, and not around when you do).\n\nIn summary, there are way better places to spend your time, money and calories.  We gave it a shot, and it wasn't our cup of tea.  If you like it, more power to you.  \n\nI usually do not review restaurants until I have given them several chances and tried different items, but I won't be returning.  I just can't bring myself to eat here.  The food is edible, but while I was eating, I actually wondered to myself why I was eating it.",1
"A decent spot to eat at. Our waitress wasn't as fast as she could have been considering it wasn't packed. Most of the food was tasty especially the molcajete but we had three complaints that kept coming up around the table. The fish was very sub-par, over cooked, and over seasoned. The rice was a little soggy and it was very tasteless, it was almost hard to eat to be honest. To finish it off the salsa was very watery and it felt like it was missing something. All In all, it was an alright spot I doubt we will be going back considering the long drive but I wouldn't count it out for good.",2
I used to come here all the time with friends for the ufc ppv and before it was always packed and the service and drinks were great. Now a few months later I came here and the place has completely gone downhill. The food has changed and I ordered a margherita and I got some fruity drink that has a rotten lime in it. New management or something ruined it. Never again will I come here.,0
"I feel mixed about writing this review. With all I will document below, I still will stop in again for some hot-and-readys in the future. So, initially I was super excited to realize that there was a Little Caesar's on Center close to home- though I hate that shopping area because the traffic is always terrible and it's a nightmare getting in and out of. I planned a pizza night with a friend and timed it perfectly to stop in here for hot-and-ready pizzas after work to bring home. I even called in earlier to make sure that I could stop straight in, buy pizzas, and walk out.  I realize that it was right after work when they are probably at their busiest, but I walked in and there were no hot-and-ready pizzas there! Plus, there were only two people working! It upsets me when businesses advertise specials or deals and can't guarantee or follow through with them. I didn't have to wait long (maybe 10-15 min), but I implore Little Caesar's to ONLY promise hot-and-ready pizzas when they are both hot AND ready. On the other hand, the woman behind the counter was intent on getting the pizzas out as soon as possible and was incredibly nice- it's possible that they were simply understaffed for the day. And in their defense, the pizzas were hot and still tasted great- and you can't beat the price! The other items on their menu are a great deal two (i.e., only $3 for crazy bread sticks). With that said, I will definitely be stopping in again for those deals.",2
"The food was great, the service was to amazing, drinks even better. So I suppose you're wondering why I'm giving 2 stars? The poor staff is stretched so damn thin there it's disgusting. My friend and I went many times when we were there because of their vegan menu. It was tough a couple of times service wise. But one time our waitress (who was such a sweetheart! I don't remember her name but she was a lovely, thin yoga teaching girl) was trying so hard to make sure we got our food and drink in a timely matter. The bartender was too busy not paying attention to the orders, and then they ran out of margarita stuff! We were there for punk rock bowling, and I guess the manager (who you could tell was there wearing some hideous lilac colored shirt, really dude?), was too busy sitting on his phone to notice his staff was running around trying to do the work of 5 people per person. \n\nLong story short, food is awesome, drinks... awesome. The waitstaff, fantastic. But man, I hope they're more prepared next year so I don't have to wait 30 minutes for my food and or margarita.",1
"The food was good, but the reason of the low stars was because of the slow service, we ordered food which came timely, but after dinner we wanted to order dessert, but the server paid no attention to us, and we waited for 30 minutes for the dessert menu. Nice food, but not sure if will come again due to service",1
I've been screwed twice on sessions I bought from this place! I've trained at this gym off and on for a year and use to love the workouts but apparently the gym is under new ownership and now my sessions that I bought are no longer good. I can't blame that on the new owner but this is ridiculous and I won't be returning or recommending anybody to go here.,0
"I had saw handmade burger for the past two years and FINALLY went last night! Got taken to a table by a very friendly staff. The restaurant was quite busy. We got given our menus, sitting there like a good 10-15 minutes trying to decide what to get. A decided to get the small chicken classic burger with Greek Feta. I have to say I'm not a big fan of burger but i have had better burger than this! The chicken was dry with no taste, the burger had chutney in it which it wasn't meant to have. Other than all that the service was very good and the staff were very friendly!",2
Very nice atmosphere almost upscale.  Nice ambience.  The service is very good and fast.  Here at 700 and only 3 tables.  Unfortunately the food IMHO doesn't measure to the restaurant is just average.  The pad Thai was just average the pa nang just ok the beef salad was good.  I give 3 stars cause the staff and ambiance are great but food is just average Vegas has some tough Thai competition,2
"The owner may claim to be simply 'politically incorrect' however that is a statement that I have heard from many a racist before. Its the same as saying, \""I'm not a racist, I just believe in genetic purity.\"" \n\nI was unhappy to be at the receiving end of a rant that wandered from how he threw his wife's food out because she'd put salt on it. Which apparently offended him as a chef...or something. In my opinion that is abusive, controlling, misogynist behavior that is reprehensible. It at least points to an inability to communicate and a sharp need to be correct, perhaps a dangerous need.\n\nFurthermore, his referencing 'Lousy-anna' referring to Lousiana, the Shreveport area if I remember correct, became tiresome immediately. He called the population of the area he used to live, please forgive me, niggers! His claim that he was referencing the white and black population fell short when he told a story of catching a young black child he caught stealing. He apparently asked the child why he was stealing and was offended that the answer as that \""You whites have been stealing from us for years.\""  I had to leave to get to work, I would have left just as quickly had I not had to be at work 5 minutes later. My only regret was that I had to leave my poor girlfriend there...\n\nSir, if you wish to be a racist (excuse me: Politically Incorrect) you can do it without my dollars lining your pocket. I am sad to no longer have a place on my way to work that I could stop to grab a bite. I am truly discomfited riding my bike past the cafe and seeing that you are still in business. \n\nIf you like your breakfast with a side of racism and misogyny, eat here. If you are a Russell Pearce, Joe Arpaio, or SB1070 supporter, here is your place. \n\nIf you feel that people should not be judged, eat somewhere else. Somewhere that doesn't just dress up in bible verse, perhaps somewhere that embraces christian values, not just trite statements everywhere you look.",0
"Not bad....\n\nThink Postino's, Vig, Tuck Shop, and St. Francis in terms of design, ambience, parking, and lighting.  The Windsor's menu is a little different and considerably more sandwich-oriented than the foregoing restaurants, and the servers are a tad more 'edgy' looking, but the Windsor can more or less stand as a lunchtime equal with them.\n\nBut I did suffer with a rather serious problem during my visit - strictly related to the food itself.\n\nI ordered the Crab BLT, an intriguing idea on paper, and a very attractive plate once it is set before your eyes.  I selected Jo Church's potatoes as my side dish.  My wife ordered the Schreiner's sausage with cole slaw.\n\nThe good:  The Schreiner's sausage was amazingly flavorful and quite well dressed with peppers and the like.  The thick 'Tenderbelly Bacon' crumbled throughout my Crab BLT was perfectly cooked with a slight char.  And the BUNS, oh those delicious toasted, buttered buns!!!\n\nThe not-so-good:  They seemed to really just phone-it-in on the side dishes.  The cole slaw my wife ordered seemed right out of a Basha's bag or something in terms of appearance and flavor, and the Jo Church's potatoes (creamy, shredded hash browns) were cold, undercooked, and underseasoned.  Indeed, the potatoes were on the threshold of being simply \""bad and bland\"" which is quite a sad feat considering the taters looked so good.  Also, the music did seem a tad bit on the loud side for a place like this.\n\nThe downright FOUL:  I can't help it, I wish I didn't have to say it, but I do....the crab in my crab cakes was absolutely, positively foul.  It was well breaded, well cooked, and well seasoned, so the fault did not lie in the execution, but rather in the senile old grandpa of a crab they used for my cakes.  For such a flaw to be so apparent in what is supposed to be the star of my dish, I must issue the dreaded punitive star rating.  :( \n\nI suspect I will be revising this review in the future, and in an upward direction in terms of stars.  There was quite a bit of good things in the air and on the plate that warrants a second visit, and if I order just right, I suspect I will come away with a very happy, four star experience.",1
"Great concept but just doesn't work well here.  The employees just are NOT with the program. Been here three times and the film was late each time. Employees didn't seem to care nor did the mgr when I complained.  Theatre was dirty twice  and sound was way too low the other. This is how it might get after ten years, not three months. FAIL!",1
"This place is actually pretty fun to go to at night. In the daytime, it is a really chill place to hang out with friends and drink beer. The food (tacos) are not bad. They are on the small side but taste pretty good. \n\nThe only problem that I have with this place is that it does not smell very good. It's not extremely dirty (it is as clean as it can be with a ton of drunk people around all the time) but it just smells like bathroom.",2
"My experience with Seksun was just ok. It was Friday night at 6pm the place was dead. I saw the conveyor belt, probably a 2 minutes loop compared with what we had before a 6 minutes loop in Oregon this belt felt short. The same 10 dishes were going around and around. I ordered some hamachi sashimi, fried veggie spring rolls and 2 spicy hand rolls because the belt selection was very limited.",1
"I had never been to CG and decided to indulge myself a little while out of town on business. After a brief conversation with a foodie friend, I was directed to CG over Ruths Chris for a good steak experience. \n\nFood: 1 Star \n\nFor fancy steakhouses, I only have Flemings and Mortons to compare to. I also have the wise words of my father who always told me that only poorly cooked steaks need steak sauce. \n\nI've been to Flemings several times and every time it's always come seasoned perfectly. At Capital Grille in Charlotte, to my surprise and disappointment, I got a $60 bill and an unseasoned, tasteless steak to show for it. I did order some bleu cheese crumbles to go with it but it didn't mix well either. I ended up using the bleu for my mashed potatoes which made those a total hit! \n\nBut to goto a fancy shmancy steakhouse where you (or your company) is charged an arm and a leg and they can't even properly cook your steak for you is just criminal. I am assuming my problem was remote and hopefully only a local problem but it left a bad taste in my mouth for the next time I goto a nice steakhouse. \n\nService: 4 Star \n\nService was great, but obviously, who cares if you get crap at your plate?",1
"I've been here a couple times, and the food is alright. Nothing special about it, but I might be biased since I usually have homemade Filipino food.\n\nWe ordered beef calderetta, pork adobo, grilled bangus, and halo halo for dessert. The beef calderetta was actually pretty good. I think I'd have to say it was my favorite dish of the night. It kind of tasted sweet, not typical of any calderetta I've ever had but I'm not complaining. The pork adobo was also a little sweeter than any adobo I'm used to. As for the grilled bangus, it was...really bland. And the halo halo didn't even have buko in it! While the food was okay, it didn't taste authentically Filipino to me.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. There would be times where the waiters and waitresses would always check up on us, followed by periods of neglect. Also, the waiting time for the food was really long, considering it wasn't that busy.\n\nOverall, this was place alright. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't throw a fit if someone was going to take me here.",1
"This is a great hotel if you don't plan on gambling.  However, I like to play blackjack in Vegas and the Palazzo has lowered the black jack payout from 3- 2 to 6 - 5.  In other words they more than doubled the casino's take/ how much you are expected to lose.  I think this is a very scummy move and there are plenty of other great hotels to chose from.",1
"What an unbelievable disappointment. The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left.\n\nWe had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.  \n\nImagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of \""cracker-like\"" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.\n\nNow, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.\n\nAfter my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.\n\nThe pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.\n\n20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread. \n\nThe high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck.",0
"We had the pine nut/chicken salad, very good, just the right amount of dressing. Pizza was pepperoni and mushroom again not to much sauce, (no pun intended ;) Overall, I can see this as a 'go to place' . \n\nSide note: I will say the service impressed me, even though the busboy was working it, every time he passed our table, he asked if we needed anything and took care of whatever.",2
"We ordered 3 bedroom sets and 2 mattresses from this place.  We were told we would have our furniture within 7-10 days. The delivery guys have been here 3 separate times now, to drop off random pieces.  The first time they came, they brought the wrong sized beds.  Now, almost 3 months after we bought our furniture, we are STILL waiting on a dresser.  90 days is a far cry from 7-10 days.  \nBUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"They need a new crew at the location immediately. The food is so horrible my kid wouldn't eat it, bc it had no flavor. Everything is always bland and the line has crumbs littered everywhere. This is the worst chipotle I've ever been to in my life. I'm a regular so I know bad chipotle when I see one. They don't pay attention to your request, so you have to repeat you order over and over. That's the third time this has happened in a month. I'm done personally, save your time and avoid this location. Drive to the camelback location or go downtown. Trust me!",0
"I LOVE Britney but she doesn't deliver in Piece of Me. \n\nThe production quality is decent but Britney, unfortunately, just goes through the motions. If she could have shown HALF the energy of her backup dancers, it would have been great. If you're not going to sing you could at least dance! She lacked energy and it doesn't appear that she's in shape to work the crowd.\n\nAdd to that the insane lines at the bars (we waited 42 minutes and got our drinks as the show began), the unusually rude security guards, and the fact that the backup band didn't even seem to be live and it just wasn't worth it. \n\nI wanted to like it!",1
"My companion and I used a Groupon at this place on the first day of our 12-day National  Parks road trip.  We spent the first two nights in Vegas,  so we conveniently had dinner here.  Our evening got off to a rocky start, as we were seated and not acknowledged by any of the wait staff for at least 10 minutes.  Finally we flagged down a waitress, who did not have our table in her rotation, but being that we were rather irate, she waited on us for our meal.  There was apparently some confusion as to who had us, and later in the meal when our original waiter was serving us too, Roger and I didn't know what to make of this haphazard arrangement.  It was nice that we could use part of our Groupon on the dinner specials, so I had the prime rib.  Roger had the short ribs.  The side dishes were quite good, and our mixed drinks were good, too.  The prime rib wasn't the best I ever tasted, but it was a good dish anyway.  The desserts were delicious: a blueberry cheesecake for Roger, and a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for me.   We tipped our waittress fairly well for making  good for the staff's initial lapse in service.  Don't think we would dine here again, but it was fun to enjoy a meal in one of the old-school casinos we had never visited before.",2
"We came in here to walk off our food coma from Sushi Mon, and this place is super huge and carries quite a variety of merchandise. We came before Christmas, so they had a section of items that would make pretty cool gifts like a hot pink Blu-Ray player for $60. There were some good deals too, like a bag of Clementine oranges for $3 with card. The employees I had encountered here were some of the friendliest in the grocery store business, so that alone, would be worth 4 stars.",2
"Dimanche 7 avril 2013\nBen et Florentine ne semble pas \u00eatre en mesure de pr\u00e9parer correctement certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de son menu. Les pancakes ne sont pas du tout ce qu'ils devraient \u00eatre.\n\nJe suis un habitu\u00e9 mais je crois qu'il faille rester avec les plats plus conventionnels. Des pancakes qui ont l'air de cr\u00eapes, c'est passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement de la recette. Aucun go\u00fbt nettement distinctif, m\u00eame pour des pancakes aux bleuets ! Surprenant. \n\nLe service est toujours courtoi en ce qui a trait aux serveuses. C'\u00e9tait la charmante Sabrina qui s'occupait de ma table. Toutefois l'acceuil des serveurs masculins est toujours aussi mauvais. Les serveuses sont les seules \u00e0 avoir le sourir.\n\nOn y retourne ? Oui, UNIQUEMENT pour les plats conventionnels comme les oeufs b\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, les d\u00e9jeuners complets (oeufs saucisses, bacon, etc...), et les smoothies d\u00e9licieux. Le reste, c'est \u00e0 oublier.\n\nSunday april 7th 2013\nBen and Florentine doesn't seem to be able to prepare correct pancakes. It's part of their menu but they can't make them to a satisfying level.\n\nAs a regular, I was shocked to find that pancakes look exactly like crepes. They are missing the shot completely. They even don't have any distinctive taste, even for all blueberries pancakes ! It's a deception all the way !\n\nThe service is always great and curtious ONLY FROM THE FEMALE STAFF. The male server are as stressed out and no-smile at all, as always. My table was served by the extremely charming Sabrina. The female staff is always smiling and happy to take your order.\n\nDo you come back to that place ? Yes AND ONLY FOR the conventional items on the menu, being eggs benedict, regular continental breakfast (eggs, sausages, bacon, etc..) and smoothies. The rest is to forget about.",1
"Decided to check out this pho place after some drinking and gambling.  The pho is just ok, probably average by SJ standard.  The broth could be hotter as mine was just warm.  Frankly, I get suspicious when the broth isn't steaming hot.   Anyhow, I just ate it and thought to myself, these out of towners just don't know what good pho tastes like.  I probably won't return, but I can now say I've been here and it's way over-rated.",1
"I haven't been to Thee Pitts again in a while, but I wanted to give it a review now as I intend to return soon.\n\nHad I reviewed this place a few years ago, upon my first couple of visits, I would have rated it a 4 or 5 but based on my last experience I'm going to have to take it down to a 3.  What many recent reviewers have shared was my experience too; dry and/or cold ribs (beef and pork) and brisket.  The pulled pork sandwich has always been a real pleaser, but as of late all of the barbecue I've eaten has lacked the smokiness all good barbecue should convey.\n\nFrom my most recent experience and the most recent reviews, I fear the proprietors may have either stopped caring or are resting on the laurels of their exposure on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives.  I'll be returning sometime in the not too distant future for a final verdict.",2
"Should not have the word Phoenix in it's name, because it is nowhere near Phoenix!  It's a fucking hour away!  Also had very bad luck with Allegiant Airlines, as both my flight in and out were 90 minutes late.  I also experienced a gate agent who, in the spirit of spring training, was a major league bitch.  No carry-on food available inside the security area either, only dine in.  I won't fly back into Mesa unless it's absolutely necessary.",1
"We have traveled the world and this has to be the most bizarre hotel we have ever stayed at!!!\nIf you are 21-25 and only interested in looking at boobs, butts and spandex then you will think this is a great party hotel.......when you are in your fifties and over the \""valley girl\"" stage or have something other to discuss than last nights conquests this is NOT the place for you. The hotel is filled with rich little kids that can afford to throw money away......everyone parades around the hotel in their bathing suit or spandex that is tighter than a wetsuit with all bodily parts hanging out. They come out of the taxi or limo like this rolling a suitcase behind them. Limos advertising \""Larry Flint\"" pull through the hotel and drop off girls......the rest look like paid escorts or hookers or they wouldn't have been hanging out with the guys they were with. I got drinks spilled on my feet in the elevator........the air conditioning in the room would never cool it down with one tiny vent on the far side of the room and 105 degree weather outside.....come Sunday at checkout time and you are on a high floor you can't get any elevator...had to go up to go down.......drinks are ridiculous prices.......I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. But if you are just wanting to go to get drunk and \""hook up\"" for the weekend, then this is the RIGHT place for you!! And then to top it off, watch your bill......they will add on things from the mini bar that you never even looked at!!!  If you are a real adult GO elsewhere. I will say the staff with polite and the interior decorations were nice. I have no desire to ever stay at a 5-star hotel again.",0
"DO NOT COME HERE! You're risking your health!\n\nI had been here before about a year ago and everything was fine. It's close to my place so I didn't drive to my normal nail place and now I wish I had. At first, everything seemed fine. \n\nThen I noticed the woman doing my nails was on the phone. She picked up the phone twice during my pedicure and talked for at least five minutes each time. That's rude, but what will make me never come here again is what happened next. \n\nI was reading a magazine when she started scrapping my feet for rough spots. Everything seemed normal until I looked up and realized she was using a CHEESE GRATER to scrape my feet. I was in such disbelief I even asked her if that was a cheese grater. She laughed and said something in another language. By then, she was already done and there was nothing I could do. \n\nTo top it off, I saw her put it away in drawer without sterilizing it, which can only lead me to believe she didn't disinfect it before using it on me. \n\nI took pictures of the cheese grater and am filing a compliant with Nevada State Board of Cosmetology.",0
"You can get good happy hour specials here. Only spent about $20 for four draft beers, a platter of wings and some pretzel bites. Service was really good. Food was just ok. Good place to watch a game. They will change just about any tv you want to something you wanna watch.",2
"Things have gone from bad to worse at this gym.  Several cardio machines are against a huge window, and are impossible to use in the afternoon due to the searing sun.  Windowshade anyone?  The locker room situation is deplorable - they built a gym with a handful of available lockers.  Needless to say, at prime time there is not a locker in sight.  Yet they continue to sell memberships and bring in more people...\nI would not recommend that anyone join this gym - too expensive for a place with no basketball court, no racquetball courts, and limited weight machines.",0
Stopped by yesterday (9/30) on the way hope from a long trip.  Wished we'd have kept going.  The place was literally empty so we figured the service would be good and the food tasty.  I ordered a bacon avacado cheese burger which was a huge dissapointment.  Seemed to take a while to get to the table (even with a near empty restaurant) and when it did the fries that accompanied it were burnt (some even black) and shrivelled up.  In other words the dregs that had been setting around for a while and they were cold.  The server seemed embarrased and said he was going to bring fresh fries but he never returned with them.  If he was that embarrassed he should have never brought them in the first place!!!!  The burger was somewhat tastless and it wasn't even luke warm.  Have been to other Mimi's so this should have been a good bet.  NOT!  Doubt I'll never return.,0
"Our party of three arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and we were promptly seated... when the greeter managed to look up and actually greet us.\n\nHowever, our waitress was wonderful; engaging and knowledgeable.  She was able to talk about the wine we selected in a way that was helpful and pretty accurate.  She shared with us that she had lived in Spain (we ordered a Spanish wine) and her recommendations were appreciated.  It was nice rapport without feeling forced.\n\nWe ordered the cheese curds in the vodka batter and they were pretty good; light and crispy and greasy.  We also ordered the soft pretzel with three different kinds of mustard and Widmer's cheese spread.  The cheese was to die for, the mustards were great.\n\nI ordered the Pork3:  chili braised pork shoulder, pickled vegetables, rice, and leaf lettuce;  Udon noodle bowl with glazed pork belly and sugar snap peas;  smoked pork spare ribs with Korean mustard sauce, cucumber salad.  Pretty good.  The spare ribs were... well, spare.  Very small meat cuts on the ribs, very hard to bite into.  The pork belly was good.  The small ramen bowl was gone much too quickly and there were no promised peas in my bowl.  The braised pork shoulder tasted delicious but I think some sort of sauce could have helped texturally; it was too much like eating a Big League Chew wad of shredded pork.  The pickled veggies were great.\n\nMy dining partners ordered the gnocchi and the Graze burger.\n\nSide note:  It would be nice if there was a way to tell by looking at the menu exactly where the food is coming from.  Are the mussels actually local?\n\nThe reviews about the noise level in this restaurant are accurate.  We had to leave eventually in order to hear each other talk.  I do not think the Graze/L'etoile comparison is necessarily a fair one.  I had one of the most amazing meals of my life at L'etoile and Graze has a totally different menu and technique.\n\nLastly, I wish there was an easy way to let Graze know that their domain name is missing the letter \""E\"" when you search for them on Google.  Drives me nuts. ;-)",2
"Wife and I haven't been to this restaurant for over 10+ years --- as I remember, it was because the food was mediocre and there are better Cantonese restaurants in the area.  But we had a restaurant.com certificate -- $25 worth of food for $3.00 so we decided to try again.  I cannot figure out how this restaurant.com thing works for the establishments.....maybe hoping for repeat business?  But what if you keep buying the coupons?  Oh well, it must work or restaurants wouldn't participate now, would they?\n\nWell this trip the restaurant probably did not lose money on us.  We spent over $60 on food and a couple of beers.  With tax and tip the bill was slightly over $80 and with the $25 coupon, I paid $55.\n\nWe had half a roast duck (mediocre-dry and not crispy); mapo tofu (good); salt and pepper shrimps and salt and pepper pork chops (both dishes prepared in the same fashion-good sized serving but the batter was a little thick and chewy); Hong Kong style pork chow mein (this was very good); and finally Mongolian beef (average at best-spice level was low and not very tasty).  The dishes were all probably priced at least $1.00 each higher than other comparable places.\n\nSo our conclusion is that with the coupon, the value is OK.  But without the coupon, it is not worth the price for the quality of the food.  In fact, both my wife and I agreed that we would rather pay the price to get better quality food.  Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad; just not very good.\n\nLastly, we agree with one other yelper -- the place was very cold.  They need to up the heating in the place.",2
"I will not be back. \n\nYes, the food is very very good... but it is not the best breakfast I've ever had. \n\nWe waited outside for an hour.  There are only two umbrellas for shade and this morning, there was no water in the jug.    \n\nThe service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were placed on stools in the window where tourists were taking pictures of us eating/the inside.  If you need to use the restroom, they send you to the hotel next door.",1
"Okay, I came to this place a lot for karaoke last year. It was fun cause I could take off my shirt and stuff and no one cared. They also had bar bingo which was a sure fire way to get drunk for under $15. \nRecently, a lot of friends were raving about the pizza, which I have had a few times before. I remember it being what I call \""bar pizza\"". Pizza that is doey and fluffy, tastes good when you are sober but even better when you are drunk, however at the end of the day there is nothing special or redeeming about it. Think of Pizza Hut or frozen pizza you may purchase at a grocery store.\nI gave the pizza another try. Perhaps I was wrong. No, it was the same doey, bar pizza. Not amazing by any standards. I asked the pizza mAker about the inspiration behind their pizza, his response \""I don't know... My mom bought a lot of tombstone when we were kids\"".\nAside from this pizza with a bad personality, the beer is way over priced, they don't even serve straub or pbr. The bartender told me they \""we're trying to get rid of that crowd\"". The crowd however added to the subpar experience. The best I can describe it is Bloomfield's jersey shore. \nIn conclusion, if you wanna eat wack pizza, pay to much for beer while being surrounded by douches Caliente  is the place for you! The best thing this place can offer is they DO serve pizza till 2 pm.",1
"Decently priced, moderate wait, and tasty food.\n\nWe got the buffet around 2pm, and stayed for about 3 hours (including the 1 hour wait to be seated) wandering the sm\u00f6rgsbord of international cuisine at the Rio.\n\nI was impressed with the number of offerings, and the ones of notable mention were:\n\n- Noodle soup bar, (the udon was pretty good)\n- Gelato station\n- Assortment of desserts (mini eclairs! moussecake! red velvet cake!)\n- King crab legs station\n- Cocktail shrimp station (next to the crab)\n\nAnd the rest was decent, but forgettable. Our server/busser was very attentive and even showed us how to use the plastic crab crackers (different than the ones I'm used to). He was friendly and filled our glasses up quickly.\n\nMy dad, husband and I knocked out 30+ crab legs ourselves ... and my sweet husband was kind enough to shell every single one for me. Clean hands! :D That's love, people ... that's love.\n\nOverall, pretty good food. It was nice that we were able to stay over until about dinner time.",2
I don't know why everyone is rating this buffet so low. I went for breakfast during the week and it was good. I had a little of everything but my favorite was chicken fried steak topped with gravy. This wasn't a large buffet so not much to choose from but the food is yummy and the prices are decent. I think it was $15/ea for breakfast.,2
"I came here as part of a bachelorette VIP party deal. I didn't set up the deal, but as a part of the package, we got a chef selection meal in the lounge/bar area of Ago. \n\nIn comparison to the decor of the rest of the Hard Rock Hotel - this place was really nice. Very modern and elegant. I really liked the look and feel of the restaurant. Our group of nine sat in the lounge area, which was cozy. No complaints about the decor. \n\nOn to the food. We were served three courses - salad, pasta and pizza. And there was nothing really memorable about each meal. The salad was just your run of the meal salad with Italian dressing. The pasta was bow-tie pasta with a pink sauce. And again, it was just OK. Nothing special. I probably should have asked for some Parmesan cheese to go with it. But therein lies another problem.....why did no one ask me if I wanted some Parmesan cheese?!?! The place was not busy on Friday night. And we got there at, what 8pm. There was hardly anyone in the dining room. Maybe everyone else in Vegas eats really late. Whatever. On to the pizza - just a very generic run of the mill cheese pizza. \n\nNow reader - I know what you are thinking....had a sat down and had a regular meal, I probably would have been happy with it. Judging by the Yelp reviews, the place serves some mighty tasty sounding Italian food. But, I have to be impartial and judge on my experience and that I have experienced way better lounge/bar food. Now, the $64 dollar question - whether I would go back. Probably not - if I was in Vegas again, I don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.",1
"Let me start by saying I'm a Travel Agent and see many hotels on site inspections so i always keep an open mind on what i see but the big thing for me is always CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The room we stayed in was in the Monaco Tower which is newly decorated and very nice. The hotel itself is yes, a little run down but that's to be expected from one of the older hotels in Vegas. \n\nThe issue I am having currently is with the Customer Service at the Riviera Hotel & Casino. My Nephew (15 yrs. old) was staying w/ us in the room and he has Juvenile Diabetes. I specifically remember him bringing his supplies (diabetic needles, insulin, etc.) which by the way he keeps in a shoe box..boys..he he...bringing it to our room and setting it on the table Friday night. Saturday Morning he ate breakfast, took a shot, and we left the room to venture out for the day. Later on when we returned to the room we noticed that when it was time to eat dinner that we could not find the \""shoebox\"" in the room. We looked everywhere!\nIt was gone so we took the next step to running around town to find a pharmacy that had the supplies we needed. After 2 hrs of running around Vegas we got the insulin and needles to give him a shot after we ate. I kept the receipts and brought it down the next morning when I went to check out. \n\nI spoke to the manager at check out and felt really bad but said that I would have to file a report at security. I did as requested and they gave me the Risk Manager's (La Cretia Evans) card and said she would call me on Monday. I never heard back from anyone at the Riviera hotel so I called them a few days later in which they had explained to me that after looking into this incident and speaking w/ the maid that they are not held responsible for this matter and there is nothing else they can do. \n\nToo bad for them as i will NEVER recommend this hotel again!",0
"Works in a pinch because they're open 24 hours, but it should be a last resort type of option. If you have exhausted all other choices, if nothing is open, if you are unable to walk across the street to get a slice of pizza, or if you are generally afraid of the dark, then and only then, should you have a meal here.\n\nI'm guilty of eating here a few times cause I can skip the line with my player's status and I'm lazy. But food is pricey for what you get and they can't cook a steak properly.  I will say the bread service is the best part, but that's not a good thing.\n\nI'm not even gonna lie, I'll probably eat here again.  Probably a few times.  But I'll live with the crap, and feel good about it. Thanks, Coach Ditka.",1
"I saw this place the other day when I was at GNC next door.  Sign said it was going to open on the 21st so I went in for lunch today.\n\nI had a build your own 1/3lb burger.  Butter bun, cheddar, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle.  It was an ok burger.  The veggies were fresh and crisp.  The meat was sort of thin and cooked well and was larger in diameter than the bun.  I also had a strawberry shake which was pretty good.  Over all the food was good enough I would stop in again if I was in the area over the other options for a burger at that intersection.  But not good enough to go across town for.\n\nThey did a complete gut and remodel of the space which previously housed a deli.  They also added a railed off patio area.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  They are fast casual and the food came out fairly quick.  The sandwiches are served open with the hot stuff one 1/2 the bun and the cold stuff on the other half so everything is still fresh when you get it.  They came to check on me part way through the meal and cleared my plate almost as soon as I finished my burger.  They seemed pretty well versed in what to do for a place that has only been open 3 days.  They were not very busy but no place I ate lunch this week was.",2
"Nitaya Thai is a good Thai restaurant. The serving staff is always incredibly friendly but the food is sort of average at best. The portions were reasonably sized but the price seemed a bit higher than some of the other places in town. However, if you're craving Thai and are in downtown Champaign this is a good place to go.",2
"What What?.?.?.... No jalapenos?!?!?!?\n \nWhat kinda joint is this. well it's flavorless, at least thats my take. The Burrittos Blah! The Tacos Blah! The Nachos Blah! All eiether had NO flavor or The Flavor was off. Its a shame to fill a thin soggy tortilla with 80 cents worth of ingredients and wrap it in such a thin piece of foil that it splits and leaks out of the bag, and charge 8 bucks for it! especially when its as sad as these!!!\n \nI tried it twice and have to pull the plug. My wallet will never again see the light of day in a place like this.\n\nI will say the staff has always been friendly though.",1
"I may have caught them on a bad day but... Overall, I have to say this place gets a tentative thumbs down from me. The food itself is decent. Nothing spectacular, but somewhat tasty (I did enjoy their fried okra).\n\nThe problem I have is their service. I think it stems from the fact that they only have ONE cash register to take orders. The person behind that register was extremely slow. In addition, I didn't even get one of the side dishes I ordered! I didn't realize until I got back to work (I took it to go). Fortunately, the place is on my way home, so I stopped by again. They did give me my side dish and I ordered an extra pulled pork sandwich; it had no BBQ sauce on it!\n\nSo for me, that's three strikes. They are kind of minor, but enough for me to leave with a figurative bad taste in my mouth.",1
"Not sure about this place. I have eaten here before and it was decent. However, tried to have lunch with the family on Sat, 3/10/12 and the place was closed at 11:30 am. Lot's of people trying to get in to eat and nobody from Dixies around. Not sure what the problem was but we were very disappointed.\n\nWent accross the street to the Queen City BBQ and had a very nice lunch.",1
"We came here after finding Slidin Thru was closed . We were hungry so we ordered a large pizza. It was half pineapple/ ham and the other side had pepperoni, mushrooms, green pepper and onions. It was a good pizza but a little greasy. We also ordered  the garlic knots which were a nice size. It was a nice filling meal!",2
"The chicken kabobs were quite disappointing. The chicken was super dry. However, the sides that came with it was good. We also got the beef kabobs. Those were much much better. The beef was moist and tender. The potatoes were excellent. Also from those two, the hummus and pita was ok. I've had better but it's worth getting. Btw, don't forget the cookie. That's pretty good.",2
"I've tested plenty of fuel in my vehicle and hands down, shell and texaco both give me the best MPG results. I will get anywhere from 18 - 22 MPG with shell and texaco and almost everywhere else, it's more like 16 - 18 (18 on a good day). Sadly, this particular shell charges an added eight cents per gallon if you use anything OTHER than cash. seriously? if you're gonna be the ONLY place in town that does this, at least make it reasonable, like a $.50 surcharge. How rediculous, 8c per gallon :-/ \n\nI don't like filling up here because only because I never have cash on me - who carries cash anyway? I'd be willing to even do a debit transaction, but this place charges extra for that too. Whatever, I'll just fill up down the street, where I don't get an added fee.\n\nedit\nAccording to the following info I found. Retailers are giving a \""discount\"" for using cash and NOT charging a surcharge for using a card. Effectively, they're raising the price of gas, and discounting cash customers.\n\n - ocregister. com/articles/credit-344140-cash-card.html\nApparently, \""The dual pricing emerged after credit-card titans MasterCard and Visa reached a court settlement in late 2010 with the U.S. Department of Justice, said Jay McKeeman, spokesman for the California Independent Oil Marketers Association in Sacramento.\n\nUntil the federal settlement, Visa and MasterCard prohibited retailers from giving consumers discounts for paying with cash or with credit cards that charge lower fees.\n\nPart of the retailers' agreement (with credit-card companies) was you could not charge a differential price for credit cards vs. cash. But the credit-card companies agreed under the settlement to stop enforcing that provision.\n\nOstensibly, service stations aren't charging more for credit-card payments, they're offering a discount for cash payments.\n \nSome questioned whether the cash-price signs are legal under state law. California law prohibits surcharges for credit-card use. But discounts are OK, so long as the retailer posts both prices.\n\""",0
"We will start with a positive.  Service is good.  Now the not good!  Went to use the restroom.  There was a female staff member holding the door open and a male staff member holding a soap refill.  Stood there for over 5 min for the the bathroom to clear out.  All the time I'm thinking \""they don't have a female that knows how to change to the soap refill so they are not closing off the bathroom!  Then it's the matter of cleanliness!  The sink in the bathroom was plugged and it looked like someone had vomited in the sink.  For all the time the employee stood at the door you'd think she would have noticed.  The fans on the patio are so filthy you wonder if the dust build-up is going to fall off on your food.  And lastly the floor in the restaurant is terrible.  It was only 5:00 o'clock and there were so many crumbs, straw wrappers, and other garbage on the floor I have to think nothing had been cleaned since they opened.  I really like Buffalo Wild Wings but I think this location needs new management or something!",1
"Living in Anchorage, I miss the days of heading over to my favorite NorCal boba shop and getting some passionfruit green tea boba.  So when I saw this place on my trip to Vegas last week, you bet I abruptly turned the rental car into the parking lot to get a boba fix.  But alas, I was not impressed.  I asked for the passionfruit tea boba with half-sugar since I'm not a fan of super sweet drinks.  Even with half-sugar the tea was ridiculously sweet, so sweet I didn't even finish it.  The actual boba were tasty - chewy but a little firm, just the way I like them.  So I fished around to get all the bobas and threw the rest of the tea away. Sigh.",2
"I always love this place. It's been where I've spent new years,valentine's day & anniversaries. But last night I was disappointed. The pizza we had for an app was over cooked and undercooked at the same time. boo. Then the skirt steak I had for dinner was alright but the horse radish potato cake that it came with had the consistency of Elmer's glue. It ruined the meal. I want to know who tasted that and thought it was good enough to serve. Gross gross.",1
"Got some lunch with a friend here last week. When we arrived, we had to wait 5 minutes for someone to seat us. It was dead in there! A couple of servers noticed us but noone came to help us.\nFinally, after being seated, we had to wait another 15 minutes before being greeted by a server. We were more than ready to order at that point. I ordered a lunch combo, which consisted of a grilled shrimp salad and the California Turkey Club. My friend got the chicken brocolli pasta. We got our food reasonably fast. \nAnyway, my salad was pretty tasty but the sandwich was BLAND. The portions were tiny. My friend said she liked the pasta but it looked kinda dry to me. \nI would recommend going somewhere else for lunch.",1
My third time getting take-out from there and getting screwed on the guac I ordered. I called and spoke to the manager and was offered a free appetizer next time I came in. Nonsense... what incentive is that... to spend more money someplace that has already screwed me 3 times. The food s good... but there is better out there in this town that delivers and gets their orders correct every time. Thought I'd give them another chance and they BLEW it. How hard can it be to put a side of guac in a bag when you're not even busy? C'mon!?!,1
"I would like to give the Compound Grill a half star, or maybe no stars at all, but I'll have to settle for one. Last night a large group of us went to see Karl Denson's Tiny Universe, posted on their website to begin at 8pm. We purchased tickets and arrived at half past seven to find that the show had been moved to 9pm. No big deal, we thought, we'll just share a few bottles of wine and pass the time.\n\nMeanwhile, a dozen television screens fill every wall with coverage of the McDowell Mountain Music Festival. Everywhere you look there's a screen of some jam band going on and on and the volume is way too high. Okay, no big deal we thought. Karl Denson is gonna show up and they'll turn this shit off and the night will begin.\n\n9pm passes and then 10pm passes. When we discussed the matter with a few of the hostesses/waitresses, they told us that they'd spoken with Karl Denson and he was on his way. On his way? This is at about 10:20pm. And if we wanted to hang around (with a bunch of $18 tickets), the show should start pretty soon, she said. When we asked to talk with a manager one of the women said there wasn't a manager available. What? How about the owner? can we please talk to someone? She informed us that the owner was probably home and asleep by now. Brilliant. Pushing 11pm we left. They were still doing sound check.\n\nThe incompetence of this place was pretty legendary last night. A \""sorry\"" would've been good enough for us. But, there was nothing but excuses and lack of responsibility taken. Maybe next time you can hold a contract with the visiting musicians. If they don't show, don't pay them. Regardless of what you do Compound Grill, we're gonna get our refund.",0
saturday at 2 : 30 pm - pre costco visit\nsurprisingly attractive inside - but food was bland and lukewarm at best - I kept flashing back to Restaurant Impossible rants about food temps. \nalthough plate removal and refills were prompt - was disapointed in everything else! I won't be back sorry. save your money and eat at home!,0
"Ha! Luxury my butt. So I came here with my mom for a little pampering... I started out soaking, before my pedicure in lukewarm water. Ok lame but whatever, I'm not a complainer(usually) while my toes were being painted a lady was attempting to do my nails. I had to hold my arms out across my body for her to reach, it was so uncomfortable and not relaxing in the least. she did a crap job. Uneven lengths, not strait, messy polish. I was pissed. I said nicely \""could you please fix this\"" she acted like she didn't knew what I was talking about. I pointed out all the spots that were messed up and asked nicely. She then started arguing with me. Hell no! I held my ground and the manager came over, acknowledged the crap job and ushered me to a proper seat where he \""fixed\"" my manicure. His attempt was admirable, I was just ready to go at this point. As I was finished i hear my mom \""you've got to be kidding me\"" I walk over to find nail polish all smeared up her arm. She was getting a gel mani and the guy forgot to dry her last coat before the hand massage. Ha! What can you do but laugh. This place is a joke. Save your time and money.",0
"Prepare to spend money. What was delivered for $41 were 2 burgers, fries, onion rings and one coke.  Fries were very good, onion rings were good and the burgers lacked real flavor.  The burger I ordered was stuffed with thick tomato slices and loads of lettuce making it impossible to eat., but the atmosphere was quaint.",1

"RIBS RIBS RIBS!!! Apparently this is the place to go for ribs. I'll have to give it to them, it was juicy and falling off the bone. But it wasn't flavorful or saucy enough. We had to ask the waiter to bring more sauce, but by the time he got it for us we were almost half way done.\n\nI got the porterhouse Pittsburgh style, which was quite delicious. The sides are huge. I opted out of the butter and garlic, so got the bowl of sauteed mushrooms on the side to top my steak. I had enough to share with my table of 11. Very reasonably priced and it was super crowded on a Sunday night. Our waiter was pretty good, he was pretty busy himself attending to all of us.\n\nI would come back for a nice, meaty meal with a group of friends.",2
Tao is a beautiful restaurant and the food is very good.  Especially the Chilean sea bass it was to die for.\n\nHowever the service was very bad.  Our server was non-existence.  Only came a couple of times and it took 10 minutes to take our order.\n\nHe seem pre-occupied and even when he took our order he was looking elsewhere. \n\nWe spent $200 for two people but I had way better service at Denny's.\n\nI wish I had brought it up to the manager at the time but we were in a rush to get to a club.  I guess it's a hit and miss reading some of these reviews.  All else equal this would of been a 5 star but service was so bad it warrants only 2.,1
"First time the BF and I dropped in I grabbed bun with pork, shrimp and eggroll. Their bun is really good. The eggroll was nice, the pork and shrimp had a nice marinade and was cooked to juicy. The noodles were blanched just right and the veggies below were very fresh. The BF had the curry and while it was full of mixed veggies and chicken, he didn't really like it. I tried a bit later at home and it tasted more like gravy than curry and I thought it was okay, but not something I would order again. \n\nWe weren't feeling so great this week and came for their vegetable and tofu pho. I don't think they have vegetarian broth here or if they do it's not on the menu. There was a lot of broccoli, carrots, bokchoy and tofu in it so they didn't skimp on that which is nice and the sprouts and basil and the \""saw leaf\"" that came to the table was very fresh. The broth was a bit too heavy with white pepper and star anise though. It did the trick with helping my sore throat, but it was abit overpowering of a flavor that I don't prefer. I hope that this isn't the usual and was just an off day...I would give it a chance again. \n\n I generally think the quality of ingredients here is better than the standard and because of the location far from any competition, the prices reflect both things so keep that in mind. People get so used to dirt cheap pho that you may feel it's expensive even though most items are below 10 bucks. I think the service is decent, and friendly both times and seem family run. \n\nI say, come for the bun / rice plate , but some of the other things I'm not too sure about. I'm sure we will be back. Sometimes we just don't want to drive all the way from Centennial to Chinatown to get some Viet food.",2
"Every now and then it's advisable to check this second hand book store as a cheaper substitute to its looming neighbour (Blackwells). Even if I've popped in for a fleeting glance the owner always asks what I'm looking for, suggests an alternative if the book is not available and eagerly helps me find exactly what I'm looking for. Admittedly some of the mark up prices will have you questioning if the shop is worthy of the second hand label (some are a little expensive) but nonetheless you may one day take heed of this advice and find a bargain.",2
"It was just kind of...meh. Based on the service. Took out of town family in Christmas Eve to check out the very interesting menu. Our waitress had no personality at all. We could almost hear her eye rolls as she left our table each time. We really felt like we were a bother to her. \n\nWe started at happy hour snacks and led into dinner. Pork belly was great! Fried artichoke was delicious and I am craving some now. Harvest salad was great. Love the pecans and blue cheese.  Others at the table ordered grilled BBQ ginger pork chop, chopped ranch salad, and the happy hour burger (great deal at $6!). \n\nOne day we'll try it again. The menu is so diverse and exciting. Wish our waitress had been on board.",2
This place is a terrible idea unless your rich and can order like 5 burritos they are acrimony as shit my burrito was 6$ and the size of like a taquito. My order was 20$ for that and 3 mini ass tacos with no flavor. If your really looking for Mexican food this ain't it. The horchata is good. Anyone recommend a real Mexican place in central Phoenix?,0
"I took my 21 month old son here for the first time today.  It's in a house that's been converted into a play space.  We were disappointed overall.  We arrived at 10 AM (their opening time) and the place was locked.  The man running the place showed up at 10:15.  Off to a bad start.  The place is cramped and taking more than one child would be very difficult since the play areas are in different rooms.  You have to basically climb over other parents and kids to get from one room to the other.  It didn't seem very clean though the toys were high quality.  Also, since it's a house, the acoustics are horrible when there are 20 loud children playing.  It can get quite claustrophobic.  It's a shame because it's a good idea in theory but has been executed poorly here.",1
"This place is a joke. Whatever you do--don't pay extra for feta cheese cuz you won't get it lol! 2nd time this has happened. 1st time, okay I understand but 2nd time - now your just making free $$ .\n\nAsked for my gyro with feta cheese, tomatoes & lettuce. Lettuce went missing too! My asst. Ordered a chicken pita & there was 4 very small pieces dried up pieces of chicken.\n\nI called to today to let them know they needed to pick up the pace & not rip people off with feta cheese, & lack of lettuce and lack of chicken of my assts lunch. But the owner answered and told me to speak with the person who made the lunches!! Are you kidding me ? What owner puts their cook on the phone ? A lazy one!! Yes, the cook messed up but to put the cook on the phone to handle the situation ?! The cook even said it was unprofessional of the owner to put him on the phone. \n\nSo, you will not get feta, lettuce, decent chicken or a answer from management/owner.. But the cook is forced to talk with angry customers! Lol! What a joke!",0
"We dined at this restaurant based on a friend's recommendation.  From the moment we sat down things were a bit off.  Our table for two had one of us against the wall and the other in a chair.  Clearly standard, but the extra long table was not.  We were so far away from each other that we could barely converse.  The couple next to us had actually turned their table and were sitting next to each other against the wall to combat this issue.  \n\nOur service was AWFUL.  The waiter barely checked in on us and when we asked him questions about the menu he provided little additional detail and was actually fairly aloof.\n\nThe food was actually worse than the table and the waiter.  I had the short rib and it was completely charred.  So overdone that I couldn't get down more than 5 bites.  When I informed the waiter how poor it was he said that they could offer us a free dessert.  Somehow at the end of a terrible meal the last thing I want is more food from you!\n\nMy husband had the lobster pot pie, which was decent but not nearly as good as you would expect for a signature dish at a restaurant of this price point.  We also tried the horseradish whipped potatoes, which I did not enjoy but that may just be due to heavy horseradish more than a universal issue.  We also had the lobster rolls and cheese fondue, which were both good.  We saw many other diners eating the Kobe burger and fries entree.  We would clearly never go back here, but I would recommend other diners stick to the less expensive and more basic options, as they seem to be more successful.",0
"My boyfriend and I had went in for dinner and was not pleased at all. Instead of going to our usual spots for Mexican food like Blanco, LA Fonda Del Sol and Z'tejas, we decided to try somewhere new. I hoped that this little joint would be awesome but within 10 minutes of arriving, I lost hope. We sat, got our menus, ordered our drinks and received our drinks. 10...15 minutes later, no one had come to our table to take our order. I got up to ask who our server was. We got an apology and our new server was really nice but it did not make up for how bad the food was. I ordered the Chile relleno and it was pretty much a soggy bell pepper with cheese that was drenched with the same salsa they served with the chips. It just looked like a sad dinner. Not worth the money... Boyfriend ordered the enchiladas - no bueno. But the drinks were good! They took care of the first round of drinks to make up for forgetting us but nothing makes me want to go back. But we tried!",1
Terrible!! \nWhen we are greeted @ the door the hostess tells us there is a $15.00 minimum per person per hour...trust me that's not a problem but such a turn off to be there greeting. We had a bunch of appetizers and  none were good. People... stop serving Guacomole from a bag it's awful!!!! Fresh is best...duh!,0
"Seat your self type of place.... Someone 10 min later brought us h2o but we didn't see anyone for at least another 10 min. \n\nAll 4 of us felt sick after we ate there. I kept finding bones in my chicken enchiladas. \n\nOur drinks were so overly strong, they tasted bad. \n\nOverall, poor experience, won't be back.",0
"me:  \""Do you have Arrogant Bastard?\""\nhim: * blank stare * then, thinking...\nme:  \""Any other micro-brew type beers in a big bottle?\""\nhim: \""Oh, a bomber? We have Fat Tire, Guiness, Heinekein, (yada yada)...\nme:  \""Great, I'll have the Fat Tire.\""\nhim:  \""That'll be $3.50\""\n\nThis was the actual conversation today at the LIQUOR STORE across from The Vig on 40th St. and Indian School.  I've been meaning to go there and today was the perfect day since the Jeep's thermostat read 97 F today.  The Drive-Thru is the bomb, perfect for a quick beer in a brown bag.  Normally, I skip the bag. \n\nYou could always go in and shop around, they have Liquor, Beer and Wine.  Arrogant Bastard is a great beer.  I love it when any product starts off the description by telling you that you're probably not going to like it....",2
"Stayed here for 1 night during the LIfe is Beautiful Festival, wanted to arrive early as I knew check in would be busy during that weekend.  When we got to the desk, we were told check in was at 4p, that seemed a little late for check in but I left my name and hoped we could just pick up our room keys when the room was available. Came back at 430 and the check in line was looong! We waited and since nothing was signed we had to wait to actually get a room assigened to us.  When we got to our room I was happy. The rooms are updated and spacious and wouldn't mind staying there for a night or 2 again.  My only complaint are the elevator wait times...they took forever and after a long day of walking around you don't want to wait in a crowded lobby just for an elevator to get there.  I liked the food court and other food options as they had Mcdonalds, Subway, and Zabbas.  They also had a sushi Restaraunt and Hash House (which seemed to have a long wait Sun morning, but that's expected) my only other tip is check to make sure you don't need anything from the gift shop that you may have forgot to pack because it does close...I believe I went around 1230a and they were closed.  The sports book is nice but the game I was trying to watch was featured on the small screen and was hard for me to see from the high top tables.  *sportsbook bar makes good bloody Mary's!",2
"I may not live in SoCal where the big KTown scene exists, but I am familiarized with the KTown in Santa Clara- so not to toot my own horn, but I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on Korean food, ne?\n\nWith a hankering for Korean food and all it's spicy, sweet, and savory goodness I came here to OHYA. To be honest, after dining here it wasn't so much of an OH YA! for me more like OH, OH ... that's it?\n\nOrdered the Dolsot Bulgogi Bibimbap and the Seafood Soft Tofu Soup. The Bibimbap was alright, props to the clay bowl and sauce being pretty decent. Good amount of veggies, but meat seemed a bit lackluster. You can bet I doused my bowl in the Gochujang sauce. The Tofu Soup was just okay, lacking in seafood, they put imitation crab meat sticks in it which is a big no-no for me. You either put mussels, clams, shrimp in it not imitation seafood.\n\nYou get a discount for checking in, so be sure to tell your server prior to your bill coming out. The service was good, being that there were only 3 other tables occupied in the huge place with 3 other servers, but only one was serving/helping out. It was interesting. Our waitress was good though, as she kept checking up on us and such.",2
"i think reviews for this place are based on happy hour experiences. the food was SHOCKINGLY hot and fast out the kitchen. methinks there's some heavy microwave usage going on. the interior of the restaurant is and dark and fancy, but the food is mediocre and overpriced.  in fact, the roaring fork became both a barometer and a joke for the remainder of our visit in scottsdale.\n\nif you want an equally priced meal with amazing food, yelp something else closer to oldtown (might i suggest something from the Baratin/FnB empire)?",1
"Just recently went there and ordered \""Super Nachos\"" Didn't get anything close to super nachos. Side order of guacomole was super runny; order of nachos was way too small for the price paid for it and no refried beans were on the nachos; barely any meat or cheese also. Went back for a refund, some lady who claimed to be the manager  named \""Virginia\"" denied my request for another menu item comparable to the price I paid for these lousy super nachos or a refund. As a returning customer, I'm appalled at such service. I liked going there, because the location was convenient from my house and the food and service was always good up until now. I will not go there again !!! Rude attitude and lousy customer service! F+!",0
"Overall, I am a fan. They're a little overpriced for not spectacular pho (couple other places have a more flavorful broth ect...) But this place is great for other things.\n\nThey have a really great selection of Boba drinks and spring rolls (Not just the standard pork/shrimp combo).  They also have Octopus Balls, Goat, Escargot, Quail...ect.\n\nIf you're feeling adventerous, give them a go. Otherwise, if you're in the mood for Pho only there are other places that do it a little better.\n\nC-",2
"I came here on a Tuesday night for Techno Taco Tuesdays. Their complimentary chips and salsa were good. Their salsa is not spicy. It's the slushy, mild kind. Their tacos were $2 that night. Their tacos normally are $3-$4 each. I already had an early dinner so only got two tacos- beef adobada and the veggie potato cheese taco. The tacos are small.\n\nThey have a very impressive craft beer selection. However, they need to know their beers. My husband ordered an IPA and one of the Belgian beers for the second round. The second beer tasted exactly like the first beer. When we asked the waiter, he said it was the right order. Uh, OK? My friend ordered an amber ale but they gave him one of the IPAs.\n\nI came here again the following week. The second time here, they forgot my friend's taco. No biggie, it happens. I got the carne asada and the veggie taco since I liked that one the last time. Carne asada was OK. Not bad or the best.\n\nI would come back during HH and please make sure you give people the right beer please!",2
"Gord and I drove to St. Jacobs a couple weeks ago.\n\nIt was lunchtime so we went to Benjamin's Restaurant & Inn.\n\nNestled in the heart of the Village of St. Jacobs, Benjamin's Restaurant & Inn offers its guests the charm of a vintage inn with modern conveniences for your comfort. For 150 years, the building which houses Benjamin's has accommodated overnight guests. Built in 1852 by a local Mennonite named Joseph Eby, the original \""Farmer's Inn\"" was a stage coach stop en route from Berlin (Kitchener) to Elmira and all other points north.\n\nI had a hamburger and fries.  The burger was good ... the fries so-so so I just had a few.\n\nGord ordered the wild boar meatloaf. He had asked to substitute the sweet potatoes fries (he's not a fan) for potato salad and the server ended up bringing both.  He said the meatloaf was good.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint and old fashioned ... there was mostly an older clientele when we were there.",2
"If I could give negative stars, I would.  \n\nTHEhotel at Mandalay Bay was supposed to be the site of my wedding on 11/11/11.  2 months before the day, the O Suite (2000sqft penthouse) was booked and paid for in full.  A week before the day, I called to confirm.  The day before, I called to confirm.\n  \nThe day of, 8 hours before the wedding, they had given the suite (as well as all other penthouse suites) to Manny Pacquiao and his entourage.  He was fighting the next night.  He had been set to fight 2 months prior when the room was booked.  He had been set to fight the week before when I called to confirm.  He had been set to fight the day before when I called to confirm.  THEhotel knew all along that this would happen, yet took my money anyway, and let me book the suite for my wedding day. \n\nMy now husband was the one to get the news at check-in, then come tell me (thus ruining the whole not-seeing-eachother-on-the-day-of-thing) w/ tears in his eyes knowing how heartbroken/stressed/upset I would be. I cried.  ALL day.  This was a destination wedding, we had people coming from across the country and other countries in general.  Now we had a skimpy 800sqft suite (which they kicked someone else out of, I'm sure) to hold a 35 person wedding ceremony & reception in?  Luckily, our great friends searched the city for what turned out to be an even better penthouse suite at the Trump Tower 4 hours before the wedding was to start (go there!).\n\nTHEhotel only offered that other suite and another basic room to us, that's it.  There was NEVER an apology, just simply a, \""we understand your frustration.\""  What they did was illegal, breach of contract.  There is a totally a small claims case there.  Finally, after PULLING TEETH we received our money back as well as a $400 comp to use at the hotel/Mandalay Bay (which we used to take all remaining guests in town out to lunch & I got a much needed 80min massage at their spa). \n\nWhile it all ended up working out and for the better (go to Trump Tower!), needless to say, I will NEVER stay here or give THEhotel/Mandalay Bay my business EVER again.",0
"Oh CB&C I hate to do this to you, but I'm afraid you earned it. And it's not about the food. I am a regular visitor to this place probably coming 2 to 3 times a month to have the buffalo chicken dip, which I highly enjoy with a side of ranch. Last night we popped in at 9pm after a movie. Closing time was 10. Sat at the bar to grab a bite, but we couldn't even get the bartender's attention for a menu. I mean all the way down to shouting \""excuse me, excuse me\"". Here's the catch, the bar was not busy, there were perhaps 5 patrons there. The guy tending bar was far more concerned with closing out for the night and talking football with some other customers to even look our way. A waitress did finally get his attention for us, and we ordered beer and asked for menus. You know what? After several minutes still no beer and the bartender was back to closing out his register. At that point we decided to leave. There is no need to beg for service and too many places to grab a meal to be ignored. CB&C, I hope you read your yelp reviews and fix this soon. I like your location, I like your food, but if I can't even order it, you've got a problem.",0
"I really want to like Sonics but the food always seems to fall short of my expectations. (and I don't expect much for fast food joints) love the numerous drink options, and the parking-ordering option, but in the end it's all about the food, and the food just isnt all that.",2
"This is my second Rock n Roll Half Marathon and all I could say afterwards was Seattle is way better! And no this is not just my hometown bias....I mean Seattle had hills and I still preferred that over the flat Vegas course!\n\nThe good:\n1. Easy access to health and fitness expo prior with no parking fee.\n2. Running at night with all the lights from the main Strip.\n3. Weather was nice (not windy, not cold).\n\nThe bad (this list is long):\n1. Running bag with little to no goodies/coupons.\n2. More expensive registration fee than a lot of other cities.\n3. Difficult to find parking near the start line, thus needing to walk 1-2 miles to just get to the start.\n4. Rubbing elbows with people for the first mile of the run due to the amount of people per corral.\n5. Poorly lit or unlit roads near Fremont street...first off it's ghetto there and second  off now I'm going to trip and potentially get injured =(\n6. Post-race snacks after the finish line were lame!  They didn't have bottles of water right after the finish line...you had to walk quite a ways before finding a bottle.  And in terms of the snacks, I mean at least throw in some bananas.  At the Seattle one there was a plethora of snacks and even jamba juice.  They had beer....but honestly I'd prefer a banana over a beer after a long run.\n7.  The medals were not consistent.  I ended up with a nice one, but my brothers ended up with some jacked up looking medals with faded print and colors.  However, they did say they would replace the medal after my brother took a picture of his and sent in an email.\n\nI know the amount of people at the Vegas run is 30k plus, a lot more than other cities.  However, the novelty of the Strip lights wore off pretty quickly.  I think it's a more difficult run since there's little visual stimulation on a straight course at night time.  Only positive for me is that I shaved off 10 minutes from my last PR =)",1
"Slow, painfully slow service.  Only one register open regardless of the length of line.  They exist only because they have a perfect location.  Unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in.  Wait times for food are horrendous.  There will be numerous people with food in hand in line, yet they sometimes have the only register person also making espresso drinks (slowing down the entire line).  I guess that 2nd register at the end is just for show.",0
Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.,0
"I basically was forced into joining Health Net, because my Blue Cross policy did not meet the requirements driven by Obamacare. Due to my budget restrictions (insuring a family of four, with 2 adults over 50) I basically had two choices, and each was with Health Net. After two months, I can say they have been generally incompetent, and I haven't even filed a claim yet. Their website regularly fails to allow me to make a payment. They don't send me bills by US mail or email, although I've selected both methods. Their Accounting department doesn't acknowledge payments I've made 40 days ago. I do have membership cards, but how can you trust a company that doesn't even have the ability to be competent at the basic stuff like billing and accounting. How could healthcare.gov use a supplier that isn't prepared to take on a large number of clients? After April their customer service hours have been reduced, which is another sign of incompetence. \nI wish I could go elsewhere, but even if I could afford it, I cannot change medical insurers for 12 months, as I understand it. Thanks to all in DC, for another job well done! But of course, I doubt anyone in the Federal government  has to deal with Health Net as their insurer.....",0
"OK, so here's the thing.\n\nI love the sushi here. I really do. I've gone to this location many times and I really love the rolls. Notable favorites: Vegas Roll, Dragon Roll, Tootsy Maki, and Spicy Tuna. Also, they have garlic edamame here and it's AMAZING. \n\nIs there a fun, great variety? No. Is the sushi \""best in the world\"" quality? No. Is the music pretty loud? Yes. They DO have reverse happy hour, which is of course great. However, the first time my friend and I came late at night, there was no problem; the second, we were told that unless we were of age to drink, we couldn't come in. It didn't make sense. We were not trying to drink or sit at the bar, and it's not like RA becomes some sort of nightclub after 10. Still, the waiter refused to seat us.\nSo that was kind of, well, off-putting. It's the main reason for 3 stars rather than 4.\n\nOtherwise, it's fine, but there are better sushi places out there.",2
"We came to watch Sirens prior to watching Mystere. Crowds started to accumulate at 8p for the 830p show on a Sun night.\n\nPick a spot in the middle since there are 2 ships that take part in the show.

"We paid a 'resort fee' however the jacuzzi was closed, the deceiving swimming pool was nasty dirty. Our bed sheets did not look clean and my daughter left with bug bites...we filled a complaint but the only thing we heard was ' pest control said nothing was detected'.

"The service was good and the atmosphere is nice...but the food...a joke. We ordered the rib eye, the chorizo, the sauteed shrimp and the steak tar tar to start....and to end. We took a few bites and realized we had to go somewhere else and eat pronto. The rib eye was 2 slices of a decent steake but verrrry fatty...and that was the best part of the meal. The chorizo was less stellar than Jimmy Dean and i dont even eat that garbage. The shrimp tasted like it went from the freezer to the microwave in bacon fat. And the tar tar... which my friend ordered and he has worked in some of the finer NY restaurants including Ciprianis.. was laughable. When the waiter came to ask if we needed anything more we said the check and the nearest decent restaurant. I said the \""chef should be demoted to bus boy\"". He summoned his manager who was nice enough but insisted that his chef was \""one of the best in spain\"". Insert laughter here. Ok well congratulations to him but this food was nothing but overpriced. He comped the two dishes we left on the plate (which was not our intention) and apologized but we left hungry and very disappointed. And btw i have been to Spain and the food there is not spectacular as rule but the great Tapas places are all about quality which this place lacks.",1
"Literally anyone with taste buds and a digestive system can make it work at Ghengis. At one restaurant, you could walk away from the grill holding a bowl of....\n1. Curried fried rice with shrimp, egg, & sprouts\n2. Honey soy brown rice with spinach, tofu, broccoli and carrots\n3. White rice with teriyaki beef, sesame and scallions\n4. Udon noodles with peanut sauce, pork, onions, and snap peas\n5. Rotini noodles with roasted tomato sauce and sausage\n6. Tortillas filled with BBQ chicken, onions, and peppers\n7. Some disgusting combination of any/all of the above, plus calamari and some congealed sauce that was accidentally poured onto the food instead of into the sauce cup.\n\nThe endless possibility offers some novel appeal and exciting promise of your own creation, but it also makes it exceptionally difficult to know what will pair nicely together unless you're an experienced Ghengis-goer or you can already cook (and if you can already cook, what the deuce are you doing at Ghengis Grill?) Plus, if you do succumb to being overwhelmed by choices and your food sucks, it's your fault. Then, there's always the chance that your food sucking is not your fault... on two separate occasions, the chef has broken my egg before cooking it and just served me my dish, sans egg. What is fried rice without the egg? NOTHING.\n\nBasically, if you're looking for somewhere to eat with a rather diverse group of uncultured people (or a lot of children) everyone can find something to eat for a 10 dollar flat rate. However, if you've got even an inkling of gastronome in you, don't expect to be impressed.",2
"We were so tired from all the walking and thought it would be easy enough to hop on the monorail to return back to the Venetian.  We walked into one of the monorail hotels thinking the monorail station was going to be close to the entrance we had entered. WRONG!!! I swear the walk was about a mile long before we got to the ticket booths.  We might have been better walking back to the hotel since we were about a mile away anyway!\n\nThen, after we had walked through a mile in the hotel's casino, we were SHOCKED to find that the monorail is now $5!!!!! That's more expensive than Chicago's public transit system! We were not happy. This thing used to be free!!!! I guess the economy is really hitting Vegas hard.\n\nThe overall monorail ride is great. There is no conductor so say a little prayer that the automatic transit will never get stuck.  Also, remember to pay attention to signs on where to board. We missed a train because we didnt pay attention to the signs.",2
"Fox Rent A Car in many aspects that matter, is awful.  That transfer you make to another shuttle after riding your original shuttle to the airport car rental center is ridiculous.  I was told it was to avoid some sort of tax, but I think the difference between Fox and most other rental car companies was only a few dollars.  I would have gladly spent it if I had known.  I highly advise anyone reading this to make the additional investment.\n\nAfter the long, tedious, staggering line, when you finally make it to the person at the counter, they are so nice and helpful that it reminds you of the way customers SHOULD be treated.  I dealt with a few different people here for various reasons and they were all so helpful and accommodating once I finally got to them after waiting in line.\n\nGreat customer service, awful waiting time and airport shuttle transfer (way too time consuming).\n\nWould I book with them again? No.  Do they have awesome customer service when you are finally able to deal with them?  Yes.  Fox Rent A Car just has too much working against it.",1
"We tried Habaneros out a couple days ago. The staff is very friendly and the prices are spot on for the amount and type of food you get. \nThe nachos are a great starter for the value. Lots of meat, beans, cheese and all the other fixings that nachos should have. The chicken fajitas were huge for $10. Not the best ones I've had considering there's no lettuce or tomato included, but not bad. Lots of peppers and onions. \nThe carnitas burrito (enchilada style) is something I would definitely pass on. The meat was extremely bland and there wasn't any wet sauce that you could expect on an enchilada style burrito. \nI would give them a 3.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm not necessarily dying to go back. The quality just wasn't quite there, but at the price point it's still a value.",2
"Ghetto?? Need I say more.. So when we first got checked in, we went to our room...We laid on the bed to relax after being on the road...after about 30 minutes of relaxing, we hear a knock at the door..but before my husband could open the door, a Mexican lady BUSTS into our room !! She started waving her hands around in the air and was speaking Spanish to us. We were in utter disbelief! So..if that wasn't bad enough, she picks up our phone, makes a phone call (to who, I don't know), she is speaking Spanish to whoever it is she is speaking to on the phone..She got off of the phone, said something to us in Spanish and LEFT! Me and my husband were really STUNNED.. So, once we got our bearings together, we called the front desk to complain. The girl that I spoke to apologized and said that she'd talk to the maid that came in our room. Ok..so the room...it was minimally clean..the porcelain in the tub was not sparkling..the decor was meh.. the room smelled musty. The price of the room was high IMO compared to other hotels in the area considering the quality of the room. So, to make matters worse..their were teenagers running up and down the halls ALL NIGHT..So, I finally call security (which I've never done in my life while staying at a hotel, I can bare some noise, after all it's Vegas, but this was ridamndiculous) they FINALLY responded to my call and when they did, they knocked on their door. (I can hear them) and they said \""The folks next to you called and complained and said you were too loud. Please keep it quiet\"",  so all I could think is GREAT.. This dummy has now told these people who outed them! I would have preferred to be anonymous, especially me knowing nothing about who I am next to.  It truly could have been anyone that complained because they were just that loud...So  I asked if I could switch rooms after this, they told me that I couldn't.. I was like..\""WONDERFUL\"" .  So we bared with it.. We had also asked for an extra blanket for our bed at one point...I kid you not, it took about 2hrs for them to bring it.. They woke us out of our sleep by the time they finally brought  it up... Also, the area surrounding the casino is SUPER shady..make sure you carry your switchblade with you if you plan to walk the streets in that area!!! The casino floor is nice here and the Level 7 club is classy, the breakfast buffet was decent. (We got free passes)  But I definitely wouldn't stay here again. I've stayed at less pricey places and had a much better experience. I'd go to one of the hotels downtown before I'd stay here again!",0
"Despite the mixed reviews you can read for yourself about Mexi-Casa I think the food is decent. Is it authentic? Not really. Is it the best quality? Eh, not so much. But it IS decent, and I enjoyed my chicken burrito.  \n\nMy issue with Mexi-Casa is the amount they charged. My I felt the portion was pretty large and I didn't end up finishing it- but don't think I wasn't charged! I thought the drinks were over priced as well. \n\nI would come here if I was really hungry and craving a burrito in Dormont, (that happens more than you think!) but otherwise I'd rather drive to a Mad Mex.",1
"I'm not the biggest IHOP fan but each week after our weekly meeting someone picks a restaurant and this week they wanted IHOP. There was 10 of us in our party for dinner.  Our servers name was Denise got everyone's drink orders and took our dinner orders.\n\nDenise seemed to disappear for long periods of time instead of being attentive to our beverage refills. All  in all I guess her service was OK. If the place was busy I would be more forgiving but it wasn't. All in all Denise was very sweet and friendly.\n\nOn a good note I ordered the Tilapia Florentine ( two delicately seasoned tilapia filets, resting on a bed of spinach tossed in creamy Alfredo sauce and served with creamy mashed potatoes) I asked for a vegetable instead of the mashed potatoes). When my dish arrived I did not see the menu said my Tilapia came in a  Alfredo sauce. I asked what the sauce was and Denise told me ad asked \""Why didn't I want the Alfredo sauce  \"" I replied I didn't see it was in a sauce\"", She asked if I'd like it without the sauce and brought me a new Tilapia dish with no problems or attitude. \n\nWhat can I say? It's IHOP. Need I say more? Everyone else in my group enjoyed their meals. Sometimes you are in the mood for IHOP like food we were. Our expectations were met and IHOP didn't disappoint us.\n\nFOOD: I don't expect much from these types of restaurants so it's a hard to let me down when I eat there. The food is OK nothing special but It hit the spot. SERVICE: We liked the service that was given to us. The restaurant accommodated our party of  10 no problem.  Our waitress was friendly, attentive and efficient. CONCLUSION: The food was  good, typical IHOP food. No complaints on that at all. You get exactly what you expect. IHOP is IHOP, Its laid back, casual dining. The experience is better when you're with friends. The menu is the same everywhere. RETURN FACTOR: 100%]\n\n************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************\n\n5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well! \n4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business. \n3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again. \n2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family. \n1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT",2
"Overall, the best sound setup for jazz in the city.\nThe food leaves something (dinner somewhere else) to be desired, the drinks are tiny and the covers are high.\nBut - I've seen consistently good music here. Either the owner is an avid jazz fan or just knows what talent is and books it.\n\nOther jazz clubs in Montreal keep a tight leash on their rotation so you end up seeing the same acts again and again. Upstairs Jazz keeps a good mix of Canadian and international musicians in an unpredictible line-up. This fact alone keeps me coming back to find my seat at the bar for at least two sets, sometimes all three.",2
I am a loyal Einsteins customer so it pains me to leave a negative review but this is literally the worst location. The food is still up to par every time I've been but the customer service is awful and unprofessional it also feels a little dirtier and less kept them most locations. It wasn't all bad there was one employee who almost seemed embarrassed for the rest. I still love Einsteins  but will not be coming to this one again. Very unfortunate.,1
"My folks love this place and took me there for breakfast last weekend.  I must assume that it was just a bad day but the way the handled it tells me I wont go back.\n\nWe sat for 20 minutes before we finally flagged down a waitress who then told us that though this was not her section (every table around ours was somehow) that she would still help us.\n\nWe placed our order and 30 minutes later, we got our breakfast...cold, overcooked and tasteless.  Our poached eggs where hard cooked, the omelets dark brown from burn, hollandaise that was tasteless and runny. We voiced our complaints and where told that the kitchen was having a bad day but no form of atonement was offered.  I really don't think we should have had to pay fully for our meal or at least a free drink or something to say \""I'm sorry for your crap meal but come back and we will prove we don't completely suck\""",0
"Gonna make this short. Told the waiter it was my birthday. It was my 21st. Our bill was over 400$ and it was for three people. The price i don't care about. But just because there is a party of 20 next to us does not mean you can simply ignore us. I asked for lemons literally 4 times. Asked for bread 3 times. He couldn't explain ANYTHING on the menu that we asked him for. And he charged me for an extra drink \""by accident\"". I don't know if the server thought I was an idiot or if I was just naive but I work at a shitty little hole in the wall on LA and my manager would be livid if he knew we ignored a guest who spent a good amount. The servers name was Juan and I will make sure to avoid this place next time passing through the Luxor.",0
"There's a snack bar in the back of Mermaids that sells two culinary masterpieces, in the same genre as the dearly departed Ho Dog: a deep fried Twinkie, and deep fried Oreos.  Both were covered in a thick layer of heavy batter.  The Oreos had a bit of chocolate flavor.  The Twinkie's creamy center helped enhance an otherwise nondescript piece of fried dough.  I was a little disappointed.  They were neither good enough nor bad enough to be memorable.",1
"Lately I've been eating at a lot of buffets. Everyone pretty much has the same items so I've started creating my own dishes from what I'm presented with.  I've already liked this buffet.  This one time I came here for a Sunday Brunch, I got full on all their usual breakfast dishes.  Looking for something different I discovered my new addiction by mistake, it's brisket in miso soup with green onion FTW it's so freaking good. At the carving station I asked for a piece of brisket it already looked good. I grabbed a bowl to put au jus into, which is usually next to the carving station, but it was miso soup instead and since I didn't want to waste the miso soup I added green onion just as your suppose to and was going to finish it after the brisket. I ended up dunking pieces of brisket into the miso soup and loved it.  I went back for 2nds and 3rds. I've been back 2 more other times just looking for miso soup and brisket.  The last time they had brisket and hid the miso soup in another section. I found it and enjoyed just plates of it. Trust me forget the rest of the item and just do brisket and miso soup with green onion unless it's crab legs but even on those nights I might just do it only.\n\nThey place gets busy and lines do get long but I don't think any of them know about this brisket and miso soup combination haha.",2
"My first time here. My husband visited a couple of weeks ago and loved it.  He thinks it is better than Pita Jungle, but I am neutral. I had the chicken supreme. The chicken was delicious but I was not a fan of the reddish sauce on the beans.  I am not sure what it was, but the flavor did not appeal to me and it was also used on the grilled veggies. Hubby LOVES those. We also had the chicken quesadilla which was pretty tasty. The salad was really fresh and the lemon vinaigrette was very nice. Small little place, and it was a little warm inside. Only fountain iced tea which is a strike for me. Food was not knock your socks off, but ok so it will not be a place I am dying to eat at all the time.",2
"By reading and asking around, we got APDC recommended, so I made a reservation. We expected a great night out with marvelous food, but no! Everything they served was greasy and fat. My husband and my father ordered the pork tenderloin, which needed to be prepared for an hour? And it was such a setback! Only a big piece of meat on your plate. Red cabbage was drown in the grease, horrible! They took three bites and didn't finished it.  I had the salmon, which wasn't great either and my mom had happy pork chop, was ok. For these prices, we eat in Manhattan a great dish! \n\nAlso the people next to us gave back their food, not a good sign.\n\nDon't go here!! There are so many other great restaurants you can go.",0
"I ate here on a Sunday night.... Here is the low down. It's a damn good burger, I can't give it \""great,\"" and I wouldn't go too far out of your way for it, but if it's convenient and you're looking for something better than fast food, and you don't want to eat upscale (because all you really want is a burger) then this is your spot. Pretty expensive, but if your eating in Vegas and searching for \""a better burger\"" then you ready for these prices. It's a safe call that probably won't change your life.",2
"This particular branch leaves much to be desired! The service felt very rushed....in fact, the server was preoccupied with other things, and not only pushy, but quite argumentative. He checked on us twice, once to take our order (which he rushed through) and once to collect our money. The food was very bland, and the toast was charred when it was served. Not a good breakfast choice with so many other options in the area.",1
"While we did have a large party on a friday night we expected the wait to be a bit long... but not 50 minutes... then it took forever to get our drinks. We got no crayons for the kids even after we asked. It took 30 mins to get the appetizers & salads... Im not sure if the waitress was just overwhelmed but we got only 1 refill and that wasnt until the manager came over with our dinners which was served to adults first then kids 5 minutes later... overall I think this was the worst experience we have ever had at a Chili's... the 2 stars is soley for the food, which was good ...",1
"Been here before quite some time ago probably for a burro.  Came in today just for menudo. I won't be back for it again.  Before I could taste a spoonful I had to skim out quite honestly about 1/4 cup of oil/fat first. It literally filled the little styrofoam cup the onions/cilantro come in.   They don't clean the tripe, each piece had a layer of gooey fat on it.  Spoons were itty bitty, especially if your bowl had the pata.",0
"This was our first and last time to Liberty Market.\n\nWe ordered the biscuits and gravy and a side of liberty potatoes. It was a lot of food, which my wife and I split. We were impressed with the biscuits and gravy, they were pretty good. The liberty potatoes were very salty and greasy.\n\nAt the conclusion of eating the breakfast, my wife took a look at her Coke which came from the fountain, more specifically she looked at the glass, and there were bugs on the inside of the glass. Initially we thought that it was just a dirty glass. We looked closer, the bugs were alive and moving!\n\nAs we were examining the glass a waiter came by and asked if we had ants in our soda! We looked closer and they were ants! He apologized and took the glass and we saw him go over to the soda fountain to examine the soda nozzle. I then took a closer look at the Coke I was drinking, ANTS! Yup, they were in my glass too! And I had already drank two glasses!\n\nThe waiter came back over and said that he was going to comp our meal. I told him that it was in my glass too. He apologized asked for the bill to go and comp our meal. The problem was that while he was away another customer went to that same Coke nozzle and filled up her glass.\n\nHe came back with the comp'ed meal. We were disgusted, a little queasy, thanked him and left.\n\nThe problem was, as we were discussing after we had left the restaurant, the waiter seemed to already know what the problem was when he came up and asked if there was ants in the soda. And the fact that even he found out that there were ants in our soda he did nothing to prevent the lady who filled up her drink from the same nozzle!\n\n\""Joe\"" may be cool about insects crawling around on his food on the farm, but they need to be kept out of the sugary soda!",0
This place used to be really good for pizza and fingers they have gotton skimpy on the toppings and the fingers are small plus there prices went up! the fingers hardly had any sauce and they were the chunky fat ones not the big flat ones! they must have changed owners or something.,0
"The late night diner that comes with a side of adventure. \n\nThe food is your standard diner fare but the atmosphere is what gives this place its charm, especially if this is a late night stop for you. If you come here right after bars close, expect to stand in line for 20-30 mins, more if you have a group larger than 2-3. \n\nFood is not bad but there is always something going on at the diner. When I went last time, there was some scuffle that occured on the outside. Usually it is just how drunk people are but being from the south it was somewhat entertaining to watch. \n\nThe staff is friendly and courteous and the space is somewhat small but works for a late night stop.",2
"Nothing special, nothing fancy but my fav local dive bar...let's face it...there's not many bar choices by me! The waitress' and bartenders are always super friendly and know the locals. Food is bar food so take what you get. I will say they have some of my favorite ranch dressings though, love to dip my fries in it! Slather anything up with that ranch and it's delish! To be safe I usually stick to chicken tenders or cheese sticks. $1 domestic beers on Wed...can't beat that! (Though I'll stick to my Old Meck) they have an assortment to at least satisfy your thirst. They have a drink special everyday, and one weekday a good deal on crab legs. Bathroom needs a good scrub...but like I said, it's a dive bar! Expect to bring your own Lysol LOL\nCome visit :))",2
"P.F. Chang's In General to me has always seemed like a Glorified, Overpriced Panda Express with a crappy bar that floats every drink and skimps on the liquor. Nothing really stands out on their menu.. Changs \""Spicy Chicken\"" Is a joke, it is ZERO Spicy, They used to have the Asian Grilled steak with grilled asparagus that was pretty decent.. But of course its gone now, And A lot of the items on the menu are run of the mill Asian fast food on fancy plates in a fancy setting.. Pretty much FAIL.. I would recommend avoiding.. Too Many good chinese places in Las Vegas to waste your time on these clowns. Although I must say the service is always on point at this location, They have some servers that should be working in a real award winning restaurant.",1
"I went in to pick up some things to work on crafts for a Boy Scout Fundraiser.  I've always been told that Joanns/Michael's coupons are interchangeable and I have never had a problem in all the years I have been shopping there.  I had a 20% off of my entire purchase.  I didn't have much, in fact my total was only about $16.  I hadn't the cashier my coupon. She tried to scan it, but it didnt work.  I had to have her look at it and remind her it was from Joanns.  She then tells me I can't use it for my whole purchase, she will only take it off of the last item she rung up.  I asked her why because the coupon states the entire purchase and nothing I had was clearance.  She told me it was company policy and that she would call her manager.  The manager came and still said she would not honor the Joanns coupon after I had just watched her approve a refund for a customer in front of me that was clearly returning a used item with no receipt.  I had used this type of coupon at another Michaels before with no problem and no mention of this policy.  I informed her of this.  She told me I was more than welcome to go and try to make my purchase at another Michael's if they were willing to break company policy.  I do not believe she spoke properly to me as a customer.  Her customer service skills were definitely lacking.  I did not make that purchase and I went to Joanns down the street from this location.  This manager's treatment is definitely going to influence my decision to walk through the doors of that stood anytime soon.",1
"I had lunch on Friday, July 8 2011. They changed the menu. Horrors of horrors.  The salad that was perfect , farmers , was a soggy mess with too much dressing.  The bread, which was perfect,is now a tasteless brown bread. They are re branding to health food, why? Why not french style. Perfect fresh food cooked well? The salad was filled with tiny grains of quoina, if you like to have a million tiny grains stuck in your teeth this is the salad for you. Also, raw green beans.....WTF?\nThe manager was nice but fox is on a downslide. Probably getting ready to go public. Too bad another chain with mediocre food.",1
"Yikes. This place is cool looking, and has nice service- but the food is totally lacking. \n\nMy friend and I went for lunch and were seated within a few minutes. I saw there was a free chips & salsa with Yelp check in. I requested that, with a side of guac. I was told that the guac would be $5. Seemed kinda steep but maybe they make it super well- so I ordered it. \n\nGuac arrives and it is in a small cup- that could fairly be priced at 2-3 bucks- if it's quite good. This stuff was like a movie prop- it looked right but had 0.0 flavor. It was so odd. In addition to being a small serving, & having no flavor - there were also two golf ball sized chunks of underripe avocado. Like you couldn't cut then with a knife. So weird. Literally no flavor. How do you fug up guac? It's avocado, garlic, salt, lime, onion, some type of pepper. Not here though. \n\nFor lunch I had the red chilie chimi. Again- it looked nice- but really lacking in flavor and crispness of the tortilla. That came with rice and beans- both passable but that's about it. \n\nThroughout- our server was sweet and did a nice job, without which I could only leave one star. Oddly when the bill arrived our chips and salsa were on there. Our server told us she would take them off when we pay. It's weird because if you're planning your tip off the total- but the total is off by nearly four bucks?..... Also the $5 guac was now $6 on the bill. So our chips and salsa were \""free\"" but a small side of anemic guac was $6?  It's sad when the guac at Chipolte crushes this restaurant.  \n\nSo buyer beware- cool atmosphere, weak food. In the future when I'm seeking New Mexican cuisine I will hit up Richardson's in Phx.",1
"It's OK.  A smallish airport that is pretty easy to navigate, get your bags and get out.  Relatively well air conditioned which is nice considering the conditions you're likely to face once you step OUTSIDE.  \n\nFairly standard dining and shopping options --  about what you'd expect from a smaller metro airport.  Ample seating it appears.",2
"This was one of my favorite haunts when I lived in South Oakland as a student.  As a poor undergrad, the specials were excellent.  I played darts with my roommates there every Thursday while they drank $5 pitchers of Bud Light and $2 rum and cokes.  I recently revisited Garage Door with my Pitt buddies, and while I would have given it a 4-star review back in the day, I'd give it less now.  It's decent for a college dive, but doesn't hold up for grad students and beyond.",2
"If I could give a negative rating, I would. Long story short, bill was more than advertised menu price, brought to managers attention (white lady with blonde hair, think Tanya Harding mid-90s look and you will recognize her) she basically said too bad so sad, I said that's not acceptable for a quesadilla to be on the menu for $16.00 and you try to bill $20.00\n\nShe had no recourse or excuse, provided the bill without a pen. I asked for a pen and a waiter standing around (think Marc Anthony reject) threw a pen at me to sign. I immediately let Aria Conceirege know about the level of service being provided at Javier's and they immediately rectified the situation while letting the food and beverage manager know as well. Food was bland and average, nowhere near caliber of original Javier's in so cal.",0
"My wife and I were fortunate to dine hear before the crowd arrived. \n\nAs I mentioned in my review of China Mama, this center is super busy, and the greatest accomplishment is finding a parking space.\n\nWhen we walked in, there was a group of Chinese businessmen in suits, sitting at a large corner table. It almost looked like a scene from an old movie, where the Chinese Mob was planning something in San Francisco.\n\nThat was the highlight of this visit. \n\nThe bottom line is simple: The prices were on the high side for this type of food, and the quality just wasn't worth it. From the hot and sour soup, to the entree and side dishes we ordered, it seemed no better than a \""hole in the wall\"" take out, that re-heats its left overs.\n\nWe were not only disappointed with the food, but the service was less than friendly.\n\nMy friend, Phillip gave this place 5 stars 5 years ago. It must have changed owners, and the new owner is cutting corners to pay for the place. \n\nI will agree with Dave R, and his review. It's worth reading.  \n\nIf you have the good fortune of finding a parking space in this center, continue your good fortune, stay away from this place, and walk over to Q Bistro. Your wallet, and your sense of good taste will thank you!",0
"It is what it is, a discount cinema that plays movies that are just about to be released on DVD.  There are no amenities to speak of and the concessions are as expensive as any other theater.  With all that said if you want a fun cheap thing to do in the summer heat in Phoenix this place can't be beat.  The tickets are $3 and even better they are $1.50 on Tuesdays, so if you missed a new release this place can't be beat for a cheap night out.",2
"Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh, and dinner tonight was my first time in awhile at one of their establishments.\n\nBit of a complex review.  My biggest gripe with Casbah is that it's Casbah Mediterranean when the menu (at least on this night, but I don't think it changes all that much) offers very authentic Mediterranean dishes.  One lamb dish (not overly Mediterranean) and no couscous or tagine, which are major staples of Mediterranean cuisine.  Even a side of hummus and pita or veggies would be nice.  Nonetheless, the menu has lots of fine options, just none that I've seen in a typical Mediterranean joint.  I think it's a little misleading especially if you're seeking Mediterranean cuisine.\n\nWe sampled several of the cocktails, all of which were creative and well priced.  As for food, we split the bruschetta (prosciutto and blue cheese), meatballs (pork) and the brussel sprouts were quite tasty, beet salad, and the potato gnocchi. So lots of food!  All was freshly prepared with quality ingredients and served with sophisticated presentation.\n\nLots of fine restaurants opening in the area, but it's clear to see that they have a loyal following.",2
"Been here three times or so. I was really impressed by the veggie burger the first time I came and the farm salad the second time... But the third time I got the farm salad again and the portion was smaller (I got half size both times) and it just wasn't as good. I also ordered the zucchini fries, which I love but the portions were a lot smaller on my third trip, too... Also on this third trip, the chefs forgot to include avocado for my salad and two other people at my table. They also forgot the avocado on my first trip, too. So I guess watch out for the missing avocado. Hesitant to go back after a poor experience my third time... But the first two times were good....",2
"Decent prices and medicore food. I had a scallop and shrimp enchilada with black beans and rice which wasn't bad by any means but you know that full feeling that sticks around even hours after you have had your meal?? Yep, that was this. I took the leftovers back to my hotel but couldn't bring myself to eat them because I didn't want to feel that way again.\n\nThe mojito, while essentially flavorless (I kinda like to taste the mint that is supposed to be muddled into my drink) was still pretty strong. \n\nThe atmosphere is warm and it's odd but it seemed almost southern \nin its decor with the whittled wooden chairs and tables coupled with tropical leaved plants and adobe-esque colors. Hunh. Not a place I would run to, but I wouldn't run from it either.",2
"It has the wraps, smoothies and the teriyaki bowls.\nHealthy eating, brown rice, white rice, white meat, dark meat. Geeze, a variety. Nice staff\n While waiting for my order to go, Lil did I realize that they charged me 99 cents for white meat and 25 cents (to go fee). Unless If I'm desperate, I'd rather go down to another qsr and get another meal. c'mon if you're gonna mess me over, do it discreetly (like McDonalds).\nThis location doesnt accept the coupons. I was just dismayed at the fact that something that should come with the bowl, shouldnt be charged extra.",1
"Opposite experience of the below - excellent service, salad was lackluster. Sugar cookie was exactly what I was hoping for - so I would say stick to the baked goods when ordering food from a bakery kind of restaurant! Lots of options up on the menu boards, but difficult to see them all until you right up by the cashier.",2
"My drinks seemed to be a little weak and they took a while to get, but I still had a great time there. \n\nOne small request though, get a mirror in the bathroom. Even the most divey-est of dive bars I've been in, have had mirrors to check out how drunk you're looking as the night goes on.",2
"This place terrifies me. When moving into the neighbourhood, we stopped for a drink in here while waiting for the landlord to turn up with the keys. The staff were friendly enough, but this is one of those bars that when you walk in everyone turns silent and looks at you. It is at that point you know this place is not for you. But lets face it, you aren't going to be down this end of town unless you are a local and you are going to be able to suss this place out. It is the definition of a dive bar, dated and hideous decor completes the look. I am sure this place is great for the regulars, but for anyone else... keep walking.",0
"I've lived around the corner from Shari's Diner (formerly under 2 different names, I think), but I've never been there.  Why?  Well, two reasons:\n\n1. In my eyes, you are not truly a diner if you're not open 24 hours, and Shari's isn't even open late.\n\n2. The place is a kitschy 50's style diner, and I'm not 12.\n\nNonetheless, my girlfriend was in the mood for some pancakes, and this place is so close, we decided to give it a try.  It was WORSE than I thought as far as ambiance.  We showed up on some sort of special night, and they had a DJ that was taking requests for oldies music.  Why do I know this?  Because the creepy owner came over to our table and awkwardly told us so.  On top of that, there are obvious religious ties to this restaurant, and I'd prefer my food without being preached to.\n\nAs for the food, it was delicious, though.  The pancake was one of the best pancakes I've ever had, and I don't even like pancakes all that much.  We also shared some eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy.  All were really good, and our entire meal came out to just over $10.\n\nIf I find myself in the mood for breakfast food and it's early enough, I'll go to the Bagel Cafe.  If I don't mind a drive, I'll go to Blueberry Hill.  If neither of those things work, then I guess I'll be back at Shari's.",2
"I went here with a friend for lunch and I must say that it was alright. The place doesn't look like much from the outside... in fact, I was a little nervous going in, but the inside is nicely decorated. I was a bit disappointed that they had only 2 lunch specials (neither one something I would like) so we had to order off of the dinner menu which was fairly pricey. They don't even give you a salad or anything at lunch (really unusual for a sushi spot) and to order a side salad was $5.50...ridiculous. I ordered gyoza and the spicy scallop hand roll. I have never had a hand roll before, and it was alright, but hard to eat.... I probably wouldn't order one again. The gyoza were the typical gyoza (like frozen), but they fried them so at least they were crispy. My friend said her two rolls were alright. This place wasn't bad, but I don't think I would come here again.",2
"Yes, it is a run down, dark and stale room but they host some killer music.  Plus, if I refused to hear like music in old dark venues I would have missed some amazing music in L.A., Chicago, NYC and even here in KC. \n\nI care about the music, so this place did it for me...great night. \n\n I will check out who is playing the next time I am in town.",2
"Had my Taco' in for service five times since I owned it:\n1. First day owning it I was getting an engine warning I found I had no gas cap - they gave me a new one, but forgetting to include a gas cap?  \n2. First week owning I had a tire air pressure warning - took them four visits to fix the leak over a two week period\n3. Oil change with an appointment - took 2 hours while I sat and waited  \n4. Oil change dropped it off  - when I returned it took them a half an hour to find my truck, and they forgot to wash it as offered\n5. Oil change dropped it off  - had to wait over a half hour for the 'valet' to get my truck.  Oh yeah, they forgot to wash as offered again. They asked if I wanted to wait while they 'washed it up'.  I think not.\n\nService here is awful in my experience.  The only reason I gave them a two star is the oil changes are free.",1
"THE WORST MCDONALDS IN PHOENIX, THIS MCDONALDS SHOULD BE shut down and closed.

"Rest assured there is no Egyptian food here or anything close to it.  I once saw them serving falafel for dinner and nearly freaked.  Other than that, there is nothing overly unique about this classic Las Vegas style buffet.\n\nThere are two main lines that serve essentially the same things on each side.  The decor is consistent with the rest of the Luxor with sand colors all over the place and walls made of wannabe stone.  The only thing they're really missing is bits of sand and dust falling from the ceiling.  I didn't feel like a pharaoh based on the way the staff had treated me.  The prices were king-like, for a mere $25 I could enjoy my din din.  Breakfast is the better deal here for sure as its a little less than $15.\n\nThe food is good surprisingly and incredible abundant but hardly a step up from your average buffet at any of the casinos.  Its very bizarre to hang out in the pizza section where its tossed in front of you while walking around the feasts of Egypt.  That feast is usually limited to Mexican, Italian, and general American cuisine.  There is nothing that is exotic enough to mention, other than the fact their hash browns are fabulous during breakfast time.  Then again, so is the Pyramid Cafe upstairs.",2
"Worst car wash that I have ever had.  The windows where covered with smears.  Looks like they took a dirty rag to wipe them down.  I had to ask several time to have the bugs wiped off my bumper, the drips wiped off the sides of the car and the rear bumper to be wiped down.  The final straw was when I got home and realized that they hadn't even vacuumed the car at ALL!\nAll this for $13.  I had gone here for years....I will not be returning.\nAfter reading the most recent reviews of this place...I guess I should just be glad that I didn't have anything stolen from my vehicle.",0
"You know, everyone raves about this place, and I can't see it. It's annoyingly loud, the seats are pretty uncomfortable and the food quality just isn't there. I just finished having lunch with a gf who loves Grand Lux and is in from out of town, so politely agreed to join at Palazzo. I ordered something different from the Asian Nachos which is the only thing that I have had there that I thought was extra good at one time, but the last time I got them thought they had gone downhill, so decided to switch today to the Rachel (sister to a Ruben). The meat was so greasy and bad tasting that I literally had to pull it from the sandwich and eat the slaw and bread alone which too was overly greased and dripping. I stopped eating at about half because I thought it would make my stomach upset if I ate more. Trust me, I don't usually walk away from a Ruben sandwich. With so many great places to eat in Vegas why bother?",1
"This place is very cool, but they are armatures! They do NOT know how to make a real cappuccino. It is complete false advertising because the present latte art only on a Latte, which is not how you make a cappuccino. They need to goto Italy and learn what to do. I hate coffee place that cater to the ignorance of America. This place has great potential and is hip, but they need to kick it up a notch. Learn the coffee biz, don't do it half Ass!!",0
"I couldn't finish my food because it was cold and tasteless.  I've had meals at IHOP that have been better.  I should have walked out before I ate because the decor was terrible, and that should have been the first sign.  Drinking water out of an old plastic cup was also gross.  I had the eggs benedict and the muffin was not fresh and the sauce was not creamy or hot.  I will never go back.",0
"A dive bar, a country bar, a drunk bar, a cash bar with a broken ass ATM.  A bar.  I've gotten hammered at this place on cheap beer (pbr or lite beer of some kind), seen it both quiet and fucking rowdy as shit.   One night I was there and there were like 4 fights where people were really busting each others heads. That's when it's time for me to bail -- I want no part of getting accidentally shot by some guy I don't know who's just gotten stomped on by 3 other guys I don't know and decides to bust out his fucking 38 and fire a few off into the crowd.  And I'm afraid to play darts in the place because it gets so packed I'm worried some retard who's not paying attention will walk in front of me right as I throw and take a dart to the face.  D'oh!  And there's always a bunch of ugly old chicks hitting on me.  I'm taken lady, oh and 20 years younger than you, so please don't fucking touch me.  Gross.  And there are only 2 light bulbs in the whole place, and those are both neon beer signs, so you really can't tell what time it is when you are in there, until they yell GET THE FUCK OUT, IT'S 3AM AND LAST CALL WAS AN HOUR AGO. WE'RE CLOSED ASSHOLE.  \n\nBut hey, details, right Yelpers?  It's on the way home from Vistal, so can stop in for 20 or 30 coldbeers after a shitty day on the golf course.    And it is pretty dark in there, so maybe the ugly old chicks aren't that ugly or old.  Yeah, it's definitely the light.  And the beer IS pretty cold and cheap.......",2
"I went to Casablanca Cafe on Saturday (02.05.11) and walked in but nobody was there.  After a while someone walked out from the back and he said \""sit anywhere\"", but with an attitude.  I ordered the special \""Seafood Pealla Plate\"". However, when it came out I began to eat it and I found that I was eating the shell of the mussell.  I told the owner that there was a cracked shell in my plate with pieces throughout the plate. He shrugged his shoudlers and said that \"" You have to be careful with pealla\"".  I was floored with this response.  I explained that shells are not edible and he said \""that was how we make it\"".  He then began to tell me the history of where pealla came from.  I told him to forget the history lesson and I will pay and go.  After paying I left and was miles away when I realized he charged me full price even though I ordered the special, which was at a discounted price.  I will NEVER go back to this place again, and I do not advise that you go either.",0
"I went in today to get a full set of gel nails, wanted them to look natural and simple with polish over the top. What I got was a really poorly done set that looks like it needs to be filled and it has only been 2 hours since I got them done. The gel and polish do not even cover the entire nail. I mention to the lady that it was gapping she kept saying no I wont notice or it will be okay. Also I kept saying I wanted them thin and natural, they look like really cheap acrylics. Very UNHAPPY! Need to find time to get these soaked off and find a place that can do a proper job.",0
"After Thanksgiving, my husband and I went there for dinner on a Sunday, I ordered eggplant Parmesan sandwich, he ordered calzone with sausage and something else, well they forgot the sausage and the Calzone was loaded with cheese, ricotta, mozerella, no tomato or pasta sauce, I remembered Calzones from other places always add pasta sauce, but not here, also, They forgot the sausage. \n\nThank goodness my eggplant sandwich did not make me sick.\n\nLong story short, my husband ended up in E.R. with severe food poisoning. \n\nI would be very careful with the calzones here.",0
"Humongous mega mall, with deals that make David X.'s eyes light up.  And for Pete's sake, they have a little train riding around the mall for the kiddies.  Of course, and you run this risk with any outlet place, it's completely hit or miss as far as merchandise.  Sometimes they get the overstock from a good season, sometimes its a bad season.  Last time I went into this mall, I spent a good two and a half hours, entered women's stores ranging from the cheap and trampy (Forever 21) to the classy professional (Ann Taylor), tried on dozens of dresses and tops, and left with a grand total of... a few pairs of leggings.  Uh, maybe next season.",2
"Cue Club isn't what it is all hyped up to be. I have no clue why it's as popular as it is... No one even plays pool in the back. It's completely over crowded and super annoying if you are going out with a large group of people. Other than that... Their drinks are  good for a decent price. Long islands are pretty toxic as well as electric lemonade, but if you are dragged their by your friends then I always tell people to get the liquid marijuana Its offered as a shot, but it's better as a drink.",1
"I am so sad to write a 2 star review of this place...I wanted to like their food so much! But, there were some problems, that we just couldn't ignore.\n\nFirst of all, it was Saturday night, in Charlotte...now, Charlotte is a restaurant town. No where is empty on the weekends, and I don't think anyone stays home on the weekends for dinner!!! This place was completely empty. We were the only customers the entire time we were there. This is a huge red flag, but when we were done with dinner, we understood.\n\nWe got the variety plate appetizer. The falafel was nice. Hummus was good. Babaghannouj was pretty good. Their stuffed grape leaves were the best thing we had the entire meal.\n\nHubby and myself both ordered tagine, I got lamb and he got the fish. The fish was fishy...I like fish, but this just wasn't exactly right, and I can't put my finger on where it went wrong. The lamb was tender but dry...I know that sounds strange too!!! But, it was pull apart tender, but there was no moisture, no succulence...it was ok.\n\nOur other issue is that we wanted \""authentic\"" Moroccan food...If you have ever read any of my other reviews...we really really like different foods.\n\nBut, when we were ordering the waitress told us that \""authentic\"" came with french fries, and the \""american\"" style came with rice... This just doesn't seem right to me. But, the rice was nicely cooked and flavored.\n\nSometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer from trying to stay too true to their roots, and fall short because the ingredients are lacking here in the states.\n\nBut, sometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer by trying to americanize their menu...and going way too far.\n\nI think this is the problem with Casablanca. With zero customers on a Saturday night, they need to re-think their approach to Moroccan food in Charlotte.",1
"Not quite the A-List crowd like the one in NYC, but it did the job.\n\nNice looking venue (but what venue ISN'T nice looking in Vegas?), though not quite as impressive as TAO (that room is just incredible looking, but with a shitty crowd.)\n\nThe girls were very drunk and very friendly, though I must admit not so to every guy. LOL\n\nI couldnt tell you anything about the restaurant, but the drink prices were quite reasonable compared to Manhattan.",2
"I was a bit iffy about coming to a place in the notorious China Town Mall when our business associates invited us here for dinner.  We even went back a second time for a second attempt on our own.  They are located in middle of the indoor shopping complex within the strip mall.  \n\nFor cold starters, we tried Tofu Beef & Cucumber and Happy Couple, both were quite bland and a bit on the sweet side. We had an odd soup with fish ball in it, which is almost like a bowl of noodle soup without the noodle, and the soup was quite salty.\n\nThe Chicken Pot was a bit boney on the sweet side, and flavor was not all there either.  Beef Noodles was ok.  I avoided the Egg Plant.  The Taro Short Ribs was an interesting dish, but the combined flavor was just very odd even for a Chinese dish.  Chili Broth Beef & Fish was just a big mess, I could not find the star of the dish.\n\nPeach Smoothie was the best part of the meal, as it was a decent quality drink.\n\nDa Sheng was not up to par when compared with other Chinese restaurant in the area, however, they do excel in their drinks.  Perhaps they should just focus on that instead...  Service was just \""meh\"".  I suppose the low price was able to justify the poorly made food.",1
"I grew up eating in little hole in the wall chinese restaurants and I really wanted to like New Garden.  I had driven past the place many times and thought it was abandoned but after looking on Google and seeing some good reviews on Yelp I decided to give the place a try.\n\nThe interior matches the exterior,  There were food stains on the wall next to the both I was eating in.  The server laid out our place setting by handling the eating surface of every utensil she put down.  One of the bowls they brought us was dirty too.  \n\nThe server never came around to see if we needed anything else but she did decide to drop off more napkins right as we were finishing our meal.  The food isn't bad the prices don't match the service and the questionable cleanliness will make it enough for me to never come back.",0
"I really only come here for the turkey club and pesto turkey sandwiches at lunchtime, and this time I got the latter. I expected to pay maybe $7.50 for it, as there are no prices on the website or mobile app...It ended up being over 10. It came with fries. \n\nFor that price, I almost expected it to be the best turkey sandwich I ever had, and it was way short of that. I could barely taste the pesto and the whole thing needed salt! I ordered an overpriced mimosa, which the only redeeming quality to this visit was that they leave the remnants of the little champagne bottle at your table for you finish off.\nService was slow, but it did seem unusually busy for a weekday at 11:30a. My drink and food came out fast, but by the time i needed to pay and get out of there, my waitress was nowhere to be seen. \n\nI will be looking for a new place to get a turkey sandwich,lol My decision is based on first price, then service. If it had been cheap, I wouldn't have cared about the service, and if it had fantastic service, the price wouldn't have bothered me as bad. \n\nThis was my \""last straw\"" visit to this place. My husband doesn't like it,which is why i went alone. I was hoping it would impress me as it had in the past, but it was ultimately a fail. Will not be back.",0
"I actually like this place and would like to give it a higher rating, but I felt like there should be a more inexpensive lunch special.  There is harsh competition out there for lunch.  My pad thai was pretty good, but I didn't really feel like there was any spice to it at all.  I asked for medium. I guess next time I will ask for hot.  The prawns were a decent size.  I do plan on trying them again, for dinner maybe.",2
"I went for their lunch special, but they ran out of soup. They also ran out of eggrolls. They also ran out of curry. It took forty-five minutes for them to make new curry. \n\nThe extra star is for the service. Our waitress was very nice and apologetic about things which she couldn't control. \n\nAfter I ate, I also ran out. I'm not running back in either.",1
"We went on Father's Day-understaffed, and inexperienced servers, not a good use of space with the tables( could have had many more) and the food, well, we wondered why the table next to us left most of theirs.  After being served the food we understood why-muffins look great but were dry, the omelet and potatoes tasted like the canned greasethey were fried in (not a hit for our intestines either if you know what I mean, none of us felt that hot an hour later)  and even the salad dressing was gross.  We left ours too after spending 50 bux, sorry, this place was a miss.",0
"Ok I went out tonight to celebrate a friend's accomplishments and I mean to tell you the restaurant  decor was very tasteful BUT the general ambience was some BOO -JET-O! Delta's in CLT, you are not 5 star nor Michelin starred. People pay for the experience not the \""be glad we let you in\"" attitude and oh BTW, your time at the table is capped to 2 hours. What? What?        The worst part was when I inquired about the tiny table that should have only seated 6 and they crammed 9 of us in it. The hostess said\"" you had one person added to your party so we tried to accommodate you, since they joined at the last minute.\"" I have been to The Inn of Little Washington, Sequoia's, Tavern on the Glen, Butter and have NEVER been told that. Fine dining establishments allow you to be seated even if you are the first in your party, not this place. No you have to mill around until all can join in. What is this high school? Restaurant Nazi? No seat for you?\n\nThe stars are because our waitress was super nice, even though I was the last person to be served  in our party and I mean everyone had been eating 15 minutes before my food even came out. Terrible!\n If it is on your list for CIAA, don't do it Celie!!!! The company I was in was great and made it nice to be out. Will I go back? NEVA!!!",0
"We wandered over the Alley Cat Saturday night for a drink after attempting three other bars in uptown that had too long of a wait to get in. I was impressed! They had a great live cover band, who in particularly did Rage Against the Machine and the White Stripes pretty well. I liked how spacious this place is. You can come here and, even though it is packed, make your way to the bar and get a beer pretty easily with others who just want to have a good time, not pretentious people who are over dressed and under friendly. The DJ in between the sets did a pretty good job, but once he got on a killer 80's kick and we heard \""That Girl is Poison\"" I had just about had enough. It's good to throw the 80's in, don't get me wrong, but you have to know when to stop, and this guy didn't. Regardless, I would totally go back here.",2
"$109 bill. I hate it when I feel like I could have had a better meal in my own kitchen. Why would you serve me brown sugar that is so lumpy and hard as a rock? \n\nIt wasn't even sticky or the rich brown color nor did it smell like brown sugar should smell. It's obvious it was stale. Why would you even bring that out to me? \n\nThe 6oz filet was so thin and had no texture to it at all. I eat filet mignon ALOT, and in the price point that Outback is selling it for, it is outrageous that it tasted like it did. I had to ask for A1!!! IF A CUSTOMER HAS TO USE A1 to choke down a $20 steak in your restaurant, SOMEBODY SHOULD BE ARRESTED!!!  \n\nThe waiter was pleasant. The sweet potato was good, even without brown sugar.  But I can make a sweet potato at home for 1.00. \n\nI didn't like this visit at all, and for me to give it another shot, it would have to be FREE!  \n\nI would rather go Mastro's and spend an extra $15 for an 8oz filet and feel like I died and went to heaven. People who eat here are selling their taste buds AND their self respect short.",1
"Oh! Old Red Square; I mourn you. \n\nWe head to Vegas at least twice year and ritually used to kick off our trip with kick ass double martinis and caviar at Red Square every time. Gone are those great martinis,  replaced by over iced,  over priced weak drinks and tiny portions of caviar. Gone too is the caviar hour. Boo!\n\nThe service is still good and I actually prefer the new menu, but we are going to have to find a new spot. Major bummer.",1
"Ordered from them at 6:04 p.m. for delivery...at 6:52 p.m. no food...called the store to find out where our orer was and was rudely told, \""I don't know, it's not here, so it must be on it's way\""...7:23 p.m. no food...called to cancel order, and while on the phone with them the delivery guy shows up...I agree to pay, but no tip...get our food, and start going throug the bag and noticed some extra items...fried wontons and spring rolls...maybe free because they were late?...nope...there was a knock on the door...delivery guy gave us the wrong bag...got our food finally and it sucked...worst lo mein ever...will never order from Chen Wok again...oh, and sorry to the people who's food I fingered for them...",0
"Ugh this place is annoying.\n\n- too many stairs\n- bouncers are incredibly rude\n- dance floor is closed off ~11pm because it gets too crowded\n- when on the dance floor, I'm afraid to leave the dance floor (for bathroom or drink) because I'm worried I won't be able to come back\n- too crowded\n- outdoor area is too cold during the winter\n- headlining DJ doesn't come out until 1-1:30am\n- hiphop floor stinks",0
"It is nice and clean with cute dog pictures all around.  I enjoy the open layout\nOn my first visit, I really enjoyed the fajita meat, the tortillas were a bit dry and oldy tasting but oh my gosh, the PRETZEL was AMAZING. If they could make every sandwich or slider on a pretzel roll like that, it would be HEAVEN.   I was told fish tacos were also excellent.  On the second visit the pork was dry and chewy and the beer brewed sauce to go on it was non-existent.  The sandwich got lost in deep fried onion strings and I had to ask for the beer BBQ sauce which was then brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. The cheese dip was standard Velveeta like process cheese, nothing special.  Chips slightly staley tasting.  The wings were not very good due to soggy skins, too little sauce, hardly any taste and kind of chewy and too lightly flavored; just not right.  \n\nThe specialty drink I ordered was good at a price of $7.50 and not very big at all.  They brought it in a Martini glass and it was definitely not a martini drink.  It should have been alot larger for the price.  The beer list is not as extensive as Mellow Mushroom across the street.  The service was great.  The music was odd but they changed it after I asked. Something young people without money might listen to.   The lighting can be interesting at certain tables.  First visit was a 5 star but this second visit was nothing special at all.  For my 2 visits, this averages to an A-OK.",2
"You know, sometimes you just forget where you bought that pair of slacks that fits so good.  And sometimes you forget what an awful experience you had at a restaurant last time.\n\nThat's us...so fourth time is a never, ever again.  NEVER!\n\nFriday night...fish and chips.  We love fish and chips!\n\nNEVER, ever again.",0
"I agree with Brett, McKirdys is a little bit of a let down (and Ruth Chris is the business)\n\nI'm not much of a steak expert, but how you cook it doesn't matter, it's the quality of the meat. I'm not saying this stuff is low grade or anything, it's good. But it does't merit the acclaim that the waiters were quick to give it. The meat looked a little skinny, definitely not what I was expecting.\n\nDesert was excellent though. So give this place a try if you're not expecting much.",2
"We should have known not to go to Margaritaville when all the other restaurants in Westgate had long waits and we walked right in and had our choice of tables. We should have known to leave when told they do not offer happy hour on game days. \n\nWe ordered house margaritas on the rocks, which were fine. A pretty standard house margarita. They were $7.50 each. \n\nWe ordered Crab, Shrimp and Mushroom Dip, which was $12.50 roughly. It is a decent sized serving, but size doesn't matter because you won't eat more than two bites.  It has the look and consistency of a tuna melt, complete with melted cheddar on top. It does not taste like any of the stated ingredients, but more how what I imagine cat food would taste. It comes with Texas toast, the variety you would find in the frozen section of the supermarket for $3 for a family size box. We sent it back. \n\nWe also had wings with the Jamaican jerk sauce. They were mediocre at best. More edible than the cat food, but not worth ordering again. They were around $11 for 8 or so wings. \n\nService was poor, which is surprising considering how empty it was compared to all neighboring restaurants. \n\nWe left hungry and found the melted cheese that comes with pretzels and nachos at the game far better than anything at Margaritaville, if that says anything. \n\nI will never go back.",0
"Our kids love the food at Cracker Barrel. When they're away from Phoenix they lament, rhapsodize, reflect on the heavenly food last served to them at Cracker Barrel. \n\nDarrin loves the catfish and greens. Orders it for breakfast, lunch or dinner every time he's in town. Chrissie enjoys the light, fluffy pancakes. \n\nAlthough Jr Jake prefers pancakes at Coco's he's smitten by the general store filled with candy, curios, and toys, toys, and more toys. He's amused by the checker board waiting for the next set of players to sit and play. And he's delighted by the peg board at each table waiting for him to invent his own fun.\n\nWe ate dinner, then breakfast the following morning at CB. \n\n- Exceptional customer service. \n- Enchanting general store decorated for Christmas. Uncommon, yet affordable tree ornaments and toys. \n- Mediocre food.",2
"Most of the time we get Chile's to go.  We will get hamburgers because if you get the big mouth burger to go it can cost the same some fast food joints or a couple of dollars extra.  We decided to dine in here the other day.  We have been here a couple times.  We put our name on a list and waited.  The girl sat us down.  I don't know but there is something so annoying about Chile's hostesses.  We sat down and must of sat there for a good 15 minutes, which in my book is a little excessive for someone not to swing by and say be with you in a \""sec.\""  We finally had a waitress swing by and ask for drinks, by that time I was already annoyed and my wife did most of the drink ordering.  The restaurant was busy so I just needed to relax, so I tried to.  The girl never came back!  I don't know where she went.  I could of blamed it on her helping other tables, but she wasn't anywhere.  We finally ordered and when the food came it was completely wrong.  Guess what the waitress didn't bring the food, which is OK because I don't think they do that anyway.  The waitress was gone again.  I actually got up from the table to grab a person to ask them to find her.  The guy I asked helped me out and took the food back.  Then another guy came to the table.  This is when I got really mad.  The worst thing a restaurant can do is send the manager to the table in my opinion.  why can't the waitress come by an tell me anything.  He asked if we could describe the waitress.  Then he said the next few words that just make me an angry person.  He said, \""the food is on us!\""  I hate that, because I don't mind paying for food, I just want service! Well off my soap box now on the service portion.  Don't bother with this Chiles on Eastern, just get it to go and enjoy it in front of the boob tube.  Cheers!",1
"Weirdly there is no yelp for the Verona one. So I am putting it here.  But I wish I had read these. \n\nI didn't realize until I read other reviews that they include a shampoo with your hair cut. My hair cut last about 10 minutes.  I have hair that is the same length, all I wanted was it cut so that I could still put it up to sleep. I specially mentioned this to her twice.  I wish I could include a picture of how short it actually is. Good luck hearing from someone if you want to talk to someone about not liking your cut.  \n\nMy advice pay a few dollars more and find a place that will take responsibility when they screw up.",0
"I went on a Thursday. It was $10 for ladies to get in, so I found that very reasonable. On Fridays it's $20 for ladies. It wasn't very packed on Thursday, which I enjoyed. I looove that they have salt water pools, and no kids allowed of course 21+. The DJ was alright, played a lot of house at first, then some hip hop. It was pretty loud, and you have to shout a little to talk to eachother, which is fine with me. \n\nI ordered a bloody mary and a fiji water at the bar, it was about $25. That bloody mary was soooo damn tasty, I wasn't even mad about the price. The bartender was also very friendly. I believe his name was Alex, although I could be mistaken. But he was great, I really appreciated the excellent service. I cannot stand when you go to a place and employees have the nerve to act stuck up when I'm in there spending money. \n\nWhich brings me to those GD raunchy ass towel boys (aka security). Jeezus folks, super cop status, seriously? They're like pumped up d-bags who want to police everyone for no good reason. Did I mention it took almost 20 minutes to get into the place?! I only brought myself, but some people had bags of stuff. They searched eeeeverything!! \n\nThey made everyone dump out all their liquids, even contact lense fluid and hand sanitizer! They said it could be drugs, (GHB) what is this the 90's? I found it hilarious. The place wasn't even busy. My best friend was not impressed and completely hated the place before we even got inside. We didn't stay long. They lose two stars from me for the douchey security guards, and long wait.  \n\nOther than that it's a pretty cool place. But the service was horrible. If it wasn't for the super sweet bartender, good drink, and one friendly bouncer, I'd have had to start some shit up in that MF!",2
"I've lived in some pretty cruddy places before but I think this one defiantly takes the gold medal for shady offices, renters, and staff.  It looks okay during the daytime and it even takes pitbulls which is why we signed the lease. The apartment they show you looks nothing like the one you re going to live in despite them charging you an arm and a leg when you move out. The walls are usually cracked (it looked like someone punched a hole into our bathroom wall) and the kitchen is older than I am. The office staff seem genuinely uncaring and can boarder on being condescending and snide. The pool isn't cleaned often and the grounds are a mess. I lived in Solara in Tempe next to crackheads before and I can honestly say I felt safer there than I did at Coronado. The staff tells you they do background checks and blah blah blah but with police roaming the grounds every night and domestic issues happening weekly I don't believe that for a minute. Just know other apartments take pitbulls and other big breeds and you dont need to put up with this place.",1
"Ok, so I think 2 stars is harsh, but I'm rating this compared to other Vegas clubs, as I am a local and have been to almost all of them.\n\nWe came here on a Thursday.  We had a table and got right in, but there was no line so I doubt we would have had trouble.  \n\nBut inside, the bouncers were RIDICULOUS.  We were NOT behaving badly, but they kept scolding us like it was a middle school dance.  Girls could barely dance with guys, one of my friends started to grind a little bit on a guy friend sitting in the booth and she almost got thrown out.  It's Vegas - relax!\n\nAnd I agree with previous reviewers about the music - house to top 40 and even some pretty old hip hop - not up to par for a Vegas club, sorry. Go to Tryst or Marquee if you're looking for a legit Vegas club experience, and if you're a local, you'll probably have a better time at Stoney's!",1
"I used to go to Keegan's for breakfast almost every weekend. I hadn't been by in a few weeks because I've been busy, and when I went in yesterday, I was surprised to find that they had a new breakfast menu. The old breakfast menu was composed of breakfast classics: three-egg omelets, pancakes, a breakfast burrito, huevos rancheros, etc-- it was tried and true, I never had a problem finding something that I wanted to eat, and at about $6.95 per entree, I couldn't go wrong. Well, the new breakfast menu is nothing like that. I had trouble finding something that I actually WANTED to eat. Instead of three-egg omelets for $6.95, they now have one and a half or two egg frittatas for $7.95-- so they raised the prices and you're now getting even less food for the money. Also, some of the dishes on the new breakfast menu just sound straight up disgusting. Puff pastry, eggs, and marinara for breakfast? No thank you. Unfortunately, it looks like I will have to find a new breakfast joint.",1
"Ugh, Marquee...\n\nI've been here a handful of times and I just never have a good time here. I'm not exactly sure why, but XS is just so much more superior than Marquee!\n\nEven though I don't like Marquee, I always end up coming here when I go to Vegas. I don't know why. Maybe because we are always forgiving and hoping Marquee will prove us wrong. So far, nope. Out of all the times I've been here, I've only had a remotely good time twice. Once when I went with my boyfriend and his friends and they got a table - it's always fun when you have a table, lol. And the last time I came here (couple weekends ago) when Sander van Doorn was playing was the only time I had a remotely good time here. Still, meh..I prefer XS.\n\nMarquee is located in the Cosmopolitan and I will admit that the venue is really nice. It gets pretty crowded though and the walkway is kind of narrow, so I don't like that about this club since it results in everyone pushing and shoving so they don't get separated from their group - doesn't help when everyone is drunk, too. Ugh. The outdoor area is pretty nice and I actually prefer to be out there than inside. There are a lot of cabanas and a nice pool. I hear their Dayclub is a lot better than their Nightclub, so I'm definitely looking forward to checking that out to compare.\n\nAside from all this, the thing I hate most about Marquee are those damn STAIRS TO GET IN. Gawwwwwd. MARQUEE IS NOT GIRL-FRIENDLY, I TELL YOU! There are like a million flights of stairs you need to climb before you get into the actual club. WTF?! By the time I get in there, my feet are already hurting. Ugh. They have elevators to get from floor to floor (they have different levels which is a cool concept) but they only let some people use it...L;HKADH0-9DAIHDP'HODK I can't.\n\nIn short, I don't plan on coming back here because my feet will hurt..unless it's for Dayclub in the summer. If my friends really want to go though, I'll go with the flow.",2
"I really hope to see these guys make it.. I went by one day too early and one of the guys came out to say hello and let me know when they would open that day. We finally made it down there last night to give them a try... kinda weird to walk into a BBQ place and not smell the BBQ! There were a few families in there, everyone was waiting for food. We gave our order to the 12 or 13 year old behind the counter and she placed it to her side and we sat down to watch her spend the next 10 minutes continuing to take orders... (Our slip was still on the counter..) Finally the entire stack of slips was sent to the back, we joked with the table next to us that we were probably on the bottom... After quite a wait the last family that walked in got their order and left... then the couple that came in behind us got their order as we sat and waited... by now we had gotten to know them a little and they were from Kansas City...  In their words the BBQ was ok... he felt that the meat should pull from the bone, which it defiantly did not do. They completed their meal and offered us some untouched ribs while we were STILL waiting for our food! We declined and finally the food comes out. Hubby takes the cornbread and immediately pushes it to the side of the table.. he refused to try it even, \""Its cake, not bread!\"" The ribs were ok... we pretty much thought the same, that it should pull from the bone more. The coleslaw was nothing spectacular and the rice/beans were pretty much left untouched. Not a place that we would go out of our way to go to by any means... :o(",1
"I came here due to the review of the day by Tonya P. I have actually heard about this place since its been opened, but I didn't have the chance to come here to eat. So I'm going to put my tastebuds to the rest on this restaurant compared to the other Vietnamese restaurants I usually go to around Charlotte.\n\nSo here's the deal. This place used to be Pho 98, and I only had the chance to go there once a very long time ago. Inside, they redesigned the place and the interesting thing I want to mention is that the back is where the cash register is.\n\nGiven the menu, I was happy to see such a large option of choices. I ordered their pho dac biet, fresh and fried spring rolls. My mother deviated and ordered one of their B\u00fan dishes. The portion, I thought was a little \""meh.\"" I mean the B\u00fan dish, vermicelli is dry with the option of the customer putting fish sauce for a little bit of flavor, wasn't so surprising in my opinion. I feel like other Vietnamese restaurants give you a lot more for your dollar. \n\nI felt as if yeah, sure it's in south side Charlotte and things can be a little more expensive but it still matters to me and how much you get with the extra money you spend. I guess all our money went to our service, which was great by the way... One thing to note was that when you sit down there is no utensils, not to worry it will come (they didn't forget.) After they served the first dish however, I thought they forgot and I was a little confused on why they would serve food before serving anything to eat with. I think they could really spend less time on the utensils if they set it up at each table beforehand.\n\nThe Pho that I ordered was okay. The portion was pretty good, a little less than I'm used to, but overall it wasn't bad. The broth was good, tasty and it's true they don't add any MSG, but I just didn't get that satisfied feeling of amazing that I usually get.\n\nOverall, from all the hype of everyone I was expecting godliness that would trump any other Viet restaurant. But, overall I just thought it was \""okay.\"" If I could give it more stars it would probably just another 1/2 star, but nothing more... One cool thing to note was that they do sell Banh Mi.",2
phone  review -well I was going to use 2 medium free fry tickets we got via the monopoly game. But apparently you have to have 2 people in the vehicle...1 ticket get person. So I can order 2 grilled chicken sandwich combos and pay full price  and they don't give a crap...But to piece meal the order to get it cheaper...it required 2 people in the car. J and I both call Bull shit. Keep your shit food. I'm going to Chick-fil-a.,0
"We had a party of 7 on Wednesday night to celebrate 2 birthdays.  Our server, Michael, was very good.  The 7 meals, though, were just OK.  Nobody said their meal was great.  I had the Mongolian Beef and the portion was small and the meat was like beef jerky.  I haven't been to Changs in a while, but I don't think I'll be going back.",2
"We just finished our staycation at the highly recommended Westin Kierland Resort. Sadly to say, we will not return. \n\nOur kids enjoyed the water amenities. The lazy river was slower than some, the slide was closed part of the time and there is only one family pool. The flow rider was pretty awesome, though. We enjoyed the shallow entry of the pool for our toddler. \n\nThe most disappointing part of our trip was the service. There was one exceptional waiter at the flowrider, Nick. He was a glimmer of light for the hour we were watching our kids on the wave pool. Yet when we were at the family pool 90% of the time, service was terrible. We had to track someone down to get food and drinks and were treated as if we were inconveniencing them. \n\nDay 2, my key card wouldn't work. So walking through the maze of the hallways with a toddler from the pool was less then appealing. \n\nAt checkout, I found errors in our bill, and again was treated poorly. I'm interested to see what the final results our account will be charged.\n\nWe've been to a few other hotels for staycations and have had much better service for less costs.",1
"I so wanted this to be a good experience... But it wasn't.\nWe arrived at Caesars and were placed in the Forum tower in a non-smoking room which was very run down for how much we'd paid for it. There were scratches and marks all over the TV cabinet, the room was very dark and we had a view of the back car park. Unfortunately I fell ill on the second day of our stay so had to call a Doctor to the room. The receptionist promised to call the company to send one out ASAP, we waiting three hours with no word so called back... She hadn't called the Doctor because she'd misunderstood something I'd said.\nWe also had a guest moved in next door to us who was a chain smoker, filling our room with the foul aroma of fresh cigarette smoke. When we complained the hotel offered to switch our rooms which, although worked out well in the end, seemed really ridiculous considering we'd been in our apartment for two nights already and they were aware that I was deathly ill.\n\nOn saying that, when we did get moved (to the Augusta Tower) we were given an entire non-smoking floor and an absolutely breathtaking room... why we weren't given this to begin with, I don't know, as we were informed it was slightly less than the one we paid for.\n\nThe ambience on the Casino floor and helpfulness of the staff was top notch. The restaurants second to none and the overall out of hotel experience was wonderful.\nCome party and gamble here, DON'T stay here.",2
"Exceptional variety across 9 stations including  seafood, american, mexican, italian, medittaranian, asian and desserts.  The seafood was my favorite with an excellent variety of offerings all cooked very well.  The meats at Americana were good, but the Mexican food was forgettable. Sushi was ok, but having eaten at Sushi Roku the night before it was anticlimactic to say the least.  Desserts were beautiful to behold but average to the taste. Bar is extra so for $50 either come hungry or go home.  Not a bad experience, but not one I will likely repeat.",2
This review is long over due ! Not happy with the way I heard one of the groomers speaking to a dog being groomed. That should of been a red flag to begin with. Last holiday season I was visiting a a close relative in the summerlin area during some time off from work and I decided to bring my terrier with me on vacation. She really needed a bath and hair cut badly so I found K9s through yelp. When talking to the groomer that would be working on my dog that day it seemed as if they were only half way listening to my requests and I felt shooed away with out finishing my last sentence about my dogs hair cut. Which probably explains why her ears were so uneven when she was given back to me. When i took her home i could see red marks all over her private area ! My poor baby was so irritated. Not to mention 2 of her nails were cut too far back and they let me know its not a big deal and that it happens all the time. Yea OK!! I will never ever bring my dog back to this place even if it is for an emergency out of state grooming,0
Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick.,0
"Just went here tonight and they had the worst donuts I've had in my life. That includes Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme too. I love donuts and when I move to a new area I always like to check out ALL the highly reviewed donut shops. I had a boston creme donut that was filled with maybe a tablespoon of creme and was really small. The donuts were dried out (that's my fault because I went at 9PM) so I won't judge them too harshly on that part but it's still not enjoyable. The cake donuts with sprinkles were tiny and undersized. I ordered a chocolate covered buttermilk donut (normally really good if you get them at Rainbow) and the bread of the donut tasted like it was deep fried in oil that was a week old or something. Seriously, the donut tasted like old grease, to the point that it was a more prominent flavor than the chocolate frosting itself. I committed the ultimate sin and threw away the other donuts I ordered and that's a first in my life.\n\nI don't know what other people are talking about when they give these donuts great reviews but I'm guessing that these people have never eaten a real donut or a donut outside of Arizona. I don't get why all the donut shops here (golden,bosa,rainbow,etc) are copies of each other. I drove 45 minutes to Lamars Donut Shop to get some real donuts and that's BY FAR the best donut shop I've found since I moved here. Don't waste your money at Golden, you might as well go to QT and pick up a donut if you're that desperate. Even Rainbow is head and shoulders above this place.",0
"I booked a room here for a place to crash after last weekend's beer festival. During check-in, I discovered that we were getting a room across the bridge in the Luna building. We drove around, parked in the underground lot, and took the convenient elevator to the top floor. Everything great so far.\n\nThe room surpassed my admittedly meager expectations. Not sure if we got lucky or if they are all like this. It was very spacious and clean. The kitchenette has everything you might need--fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove. The separate bedroom is large for the single king bed it houses. Same thing for the bathroom--huge and bright with updated amenities. The balcony faced west and had a nice view of the lake. If there is one thing that needs attention, it's the outdated TVs. At least there was one in both the living room and the bedroom.\n\nIt later dawned on me that this building used to (or possibly still is) a condominium. The mailbox cluster out front was my first clue.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ended up on the sofa bed. At first contact, it seemed like it would be terribly uncomfortable. But we both woke up the next morning enjoying a great night's sleep. Perhaps that was the alcohol.\n\nMy one complaint? Why on Earth would you ever, EVER close the bridge? When we were walking from the room to the main village, we found that the bridge was closed until 6:30pm for a wedding. That's just a terrible idea. (1) It's very inconvenient for your guests. I admit that the walk around wasn't that bad in the end. But the idea that you're basically cutting your guests off from the majority of your resort is just silly. (2) The bridge is so unfinished. Why would you want to hold your wedding there? The security guy said it only happens a few times a year. How about never? It's dumb. Stop it.\n\nSo yes, I'm allowing that to bring my rating down. We definitely had a nice stay, but the bridge thing is just bad business.",2
"And the award for the saltiest chicken curry on the planet goes to...\n\nNo, really. I must have had a bag of salt in that chicken curry with my $5.75 lunch special. The one that strangely comes with sweet and sour chicken, rice, and egg drop soup.  Honestly, the quality wasn't terrible - but seriously. Salt city. Maybe it's MSG. Who knows! However, service was very quick. Food was out in no time. For the price, it isn't bad I suppose. Certainly wouldn't be my choice unless it was my only one. It's also fun to say you ate at Jacky Chan's.",1
"My husband and I went to Dos Caminos for our \""day-after our wedding\"" brunch. I used to come here when it was Agave and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I was a tiny bit apprehensive. I'm glad we decided to give it a go!\n\nI will have to leave an update for this restaurant because we didn't have THE BEST experience, but it wasn't awful either,...so just the 3 stars will have to do for now. First of all, the seating on the patio is much better than it was under previous ownership. They have more tables outside and it feels more open. I've always loved that patio, but now it is a much more comfortable feel.\n\nWhen our server mentioned to us that we were there for brunch so we receive a complimentary cocktail if we would like, we were all about it. We took advantage and my hubby ordered a blended margarita and I ordered a Bloody Mary. I ended up having to send the Bloody Mary back because it tasted like peppered tomato juice. They had no problem substituting it though and I replaced it with a mimosa which was delicious. \n\nThe part that bothered us was that after we ordered our complimentary cocktail, we then found out from the server that our drinks were only complimentary if we ordered from the (very limited) brunch menu section. We were already half way through our drinks so we had to stick to that menu and there are really only a handful of options. Had we known this, we would have forgone the drinks and ordered from the lunch menu. \n\nWe ordered the breakfast quesadilla, one without bacon for myself, and we waited about 20 minutes after we placed our order and munched on the trio of salsa's in front of us. For those who don't like spicy food - STAY AWAY FROM THE orange salsa. My husband can't handle spice and he mistakenly thought that might be a mango salsa and he was wrong. It was incredibly spicy even to me and I loooove my spicy food. We were both pleased with our meal and the portion siize of these quesadillas are enough to feed 2 people easily. \n\nI will be back mainly for the lovely patio, but I also want to give their lunch and/or dinner menu a try.",2
"Very cool new spot in NODA. \nWas fortunate enough to attend yet another Trinumeral event here at the Chop Shop on 11-11-11. Security was tight, yet fair. \nCool location, at the end of 35th, across tracks is pretty much exclusively theirs. Security checkpoint to even get in the lot, I walked thankfully, but they were checking trunks!!\nOnce inside the place was nice and open, bar in the back, stage in the front. 2-3 pool tables right when you enter. \nGood prices at the bar except for the fact that (sorry ladies) unless you have boobs its very hard to get served, which is the main reason this place only got 3 stars. Everything else was great, except for the bar service, obviously catering to the people who were ordering groups of shots, and ignoring people who simply wanted a beer. They also ran out of a very popular beer i won't mention but its starts with PBR, very early in the evening. Come on, you are in NODA, with a huge party and don't stock the PRB, big FUBAR.\nWill come back, but don't look forward to the iffy bar service.",2
This poor review is specifically for the groomer Susan.  We brought our dog in at 11am and said to pick up the dog in 2 hours.  When I came back at almost 4pm she did not even start grooming her.  She said she will start on her asap and instead did a 20 minute haircut that looked horrible.  I left the store and will never go back to this groomer.,0
"The first time this place was a half hour late. This second time, they were half an hour late again n I must have slept thru their half ass late knock.. Credited my card back- thank god. The only good thing that came from this joint. Try the doorbell or being on time next time. Guess that's why they work at Pizza Hut. Xoxo",0
"On a normal day I would describe this park as: A rather small amusement park located on an island in the city of Montreal, where the pricing is average, the rides are average, the food is average, hell the whole park is pretty much average.\n\nOn Halloween however the park comes to life, with special haunted houses and people walking around in costume. \nThe one negative thing about that is however, that you have to pay extra for the haunted houses..even when you have a season pass. \n\nConclusion: It's alright, not a magical adventure, but it's something to do when you're bored and have the extra cash. \nPersonally, I'd stick to only going on/around Halloween, it's way more fun.",2
"My order was completely wrong. I have no idea how I order a build your own breakfast crepe, list all of the items I want in my breakfast and end up with the breakfast burrito? The waitress was writing for a while when I ordered and I thought she just wasn't short-hand writing my order which is unusual.. I have no idea what she was writing because when my order came out wrong she showed me the order she had written down (like that solved anything) and all that was written was 'burro'. I had to ask 'so when I said I would like to build my crepe and listed off mushrooms, spinach, ham and onions you heard burrito?' (which obviously has none of those ingredients) her response was 'well, that's what everyone orders'. Are you kidding me???? \n\nAnyway, I ate the burrito because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes for my food. it was actually really good I can see why other people order it but I was really craving mushrooms.\n\n#dayruiner",0
"Nothing more than a glorified Denny's, this place gets the job done after a long night in Vegas. They offer your full fare of food. \n\nBEWARE: Their full breakfast menu ends at 11am. After that, they only have a limited selection of their breakfast items.\n\nOther than that, the place is clean, fairly fast, and has flat screens all around for you to watch your favorite sporting event.",2
"This review is based solely on this experience because I love Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf as a whole. \nI stopped there today to get an iced tea and was asked if I wanted it sweetened.  I said yes, and asked if I could have simple syrup or agave syrup because I noticed that they have it.  She asked me how many pumps and I said two and then she gave me the total of $2.49 and directed me to the window to pay.  When I pulled up the person at the window said my total was $3.60 something. I told her that the other person told me it was $2.49 and she replied that they have to charge extra if you get agave nectar. \nTwo problems with this:\n\n#1. She should have told me there was an extra charge for it. \n\n#2. A dollar something charge for 2 pumps???  Ridiculous. \n\nI don't mind paying extra for something I want, but this is not a fair business practice.",0
"Decent enough... They were super busy, as the NFL playoff games were being shown. Service was expectedly a bit on the slower side because of that, but they didn't rush us or pressure us to order more food/drinks while we were there.  I found the mango lemonade to be super sweet. We got the nacho burger and fries, which were both way too salty. The wings, however, were good.  Lots of TVs, and they happily split the checks and prepared a to-go order at our request.",2
"I finally made my way back to this place again few months ago because I wanted to have their gnocchi and bread again. It was a huge disappointment. The bread was nothing like the first time I had which was soft and fluffy, instead this time was cold and nothing out of ordinary. Even more disappointing, the gnocchi was overcooked and too soft compared to before and the flavor was just okay. When manager came by and got the check , she asked us about our dinner. I told her honestly that I didn't like it as much as I did before. She just told me it's the same chef all along. Oh well, will not be returning.",1
"After visiting the Serendipity in New York, I had to visit the one in Vegas, and it just didn't compare. After falling in love with the Frozen Hot Chocolate there I thought it would be the same here but that wasn't the case at all, maybe I came on an off day or something because the Frozen Hot Chocolate here tasted like a shake that I could get from a fast food joint.",2
"My dog and I walk this park a few times a week.  The park is clean and pet friendly, obviously.  They have a great outdoor amphitheater, although I have never seen anyone perform there.  For the most part people pick up after their animals.  I think having more pet stations would help.  The park is well kept and offers a lot of space to sit and read, play ball with your pet, fish, skate, bike or just hang out.",2
"I've been to Vegas a lot.  I usually stay at the Venetian/Palazzo and I love it there.  This time, however, I met the fam and stayed at Caesar's.  While it looked nice and seemed rather well built a lot of things were broken or non-functional.  First the jacuzzi in the room was broken.  We paid for an upgrade and got a broken jacuzzi.  That's a big fail.  Another thing was the ice maker and the soda machine on our floor.  Both were broken...for the entire 5 days we were there.   Another thing was the lack of ramps.  When rolling heavy luggage on the way to the room it would be nice not to have to lug it up stairs, even if there are only 4 or 5 of them.  Other than that, however, I enjoyed my stay.  For the right price, I wouldn't be against staying there again.  I mean very little time was spent in the room anyway because, hey, it's Vegas.",2
Went to Poppys tonight with a friend. Had Marilyn as our waitress and she was awful. Didn't smile or hardly talk to us. She was so slow and hardly checked on us. We we were done it took her 15 mins to get us our check because she didn't check on us. When we finally got the check she put on the table and didn't even say HAVE A NICE NIGHT or anything. Extremely non friendly and I would never want her as my waitress again. She is the women with the lip work done. Hope the manager of this place sees this and trains her better. I work in customer service and know what I am talking about. I wanted to say something to her personally but didn't think it was my place to tell. Won't be going back. Btw food was ok.,0
This place not bad. Pretty good for a burger place. Burgers were delish! I got the bacon cheeseburger  on multigrain bread. Really yummy! The reg fries were good. Don't bother ordering the shoe string onion things .. They're freaking oily and a waste of money. The rosemary fries are ok but too too oily. The prices are ok a bit much for a burger. $5.99 for bacon cheeseburger $2.99 for reg fries. $6.99 I believe for the bigger version of the AZ burger which my bf said was pretty good.,2
"You always know what to expect with Festival in the Park.  Lots of crowds, many many art vendors, fair food and no parking.  There are performances from local groups and schools too!  If you are lucky it will be a gorgeous sunny day that isn't too hot.\n\nWe took a blanket this year and just people-watched which is always fun here.     Freedom Park is a great place to hang out and watch the doggies sniff each other's butts.  Always a great time but glad it is just once a year!",2
"AWFUL.  Avoid this place all together.  It's a far walk from the rooms with TERRIBLE facilites.  There is a single hot tub in the facility & it's slightly larger than a typical bath.  The co-ed areas are a nice idea (esp. for a couple), but somewhat lame.  The wave relaxation area had several non-functional chairs.  \n\nMy advice:  Skip the Canyon Ranch & head over to the MGM spa.",0
"I am beginning to think some of the birds there \""need\"" rescuing.   They recently received 30 or so parakeets from a hoarder & one was so bad, it did not have many feathers on her body and was caged in a tiny, tiny cage with another - which had no beak to peck the poor girl.   I felt bad & went & bought a brand new bigger cage for the 2 so they would have more room & be more comfortable.  I did not want anyother birds in this cage.  Well I came back the next day to check on her & sure enough!  another parakeet was in there - pecking on her!   She did not look like the still playful girl of yesterday.  I was so mad.  The stupid woman there promised she would not put any other parakeet in there.  She also told me today she has seen no pecking...  well within 5 minutes of me being there today, the featherless bird got pecked twice!  and was just sitting there.  OMG    what kind of people are running this place.  They are suppose to zoom in & be kind to these abused birds & they are idiots!     This is not the first complaint I've heard about this woman working there.",0
"Here is an update on my previous 1-Star rating...\n\nEli called and apologized for not responding to my two voice mails that I had left him. Apparently, they were having some issues with their voice mail system. No problem, since it sounds like it's not their fault. I decided to give them a chance and they were able to come out three days later to do a free estimate. It was nice that they didn't require me to be at the house while they did the estimate. Eli emailed me the next day with three high quality pictures of the yard and a short estimate.\n\nI called Eli today to ask him to beat a competitor's price that had also given a free estimate and he was unwilling to do so, citing a busy season of work. All in all, once they fixed their voice mail problem I had no issues with AMS Landscape other than that they were unwilling to negotiate on price, which is understandable if your business is going well. I WOULD recommend AMS to others based on their customer service, but since no work was done I am unable to grade their landscape work.",2
Wasnt really feeling it. If your in the neighborhood I guess it's worth it but don't make the drive. The food was just okay the service was really good but couldn't redeem my  tummies disappointment. I was super excited about their bottled fanta too but sadly it was flat. Just sad and flat :( Not worth the gas to go back. Everything was just ok I really thought the yelpers had my back on this one but I guess you get led astray every once in awhile.,1
"Once in a while, it's possible that a restaurant can have a bad night. Like going on your first date with spinach on your front tooth. But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art. \nMy first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \""garlic bread\"" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it.\nService was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere.\nSo I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife.\nThird times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right.\nCleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them.\nSuffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana.",0
"Bought a dozen cupcakes using a Groupon. Cupcakes were ok, but there are much better places in town in my opinion.  The cupcake itself tasted like something I could make at home.  I thought the frosting was better than the cupcake so that was a positive.  I prefer Retro cupcakes in the northwest.  For nearby The Cupcakery is superior to Caked.  Improve the actual cupcake by making it more dense and larger and I'd come back.  For now, I'll go elsewhere.",2
"Neighborhood spot with great prices, but hit and miss fish. I prefer a sure thing.\n\n--excellent yellowtail tells me the potential is there, perhaps i have to be a regular to get the good stuff because\n\n# ikura made me want to vomit\n# tuna, salmon sashimi fishy, not fresh (this is why people don't like sushi...

"I bought a Living Social deal for this company for $500 worth of services. The sales guy came out for an estimate, and after an hour and a half of my husband and I listening to how great the company is and  how great the windows are, we get a quote that was 1500 for one window on my balcony....the total was $2058 so that is 1500 for one window after the $500 discount, which is fine. My husband and I were going to let him know after we talked about it and decided when we would be able to have it installed by the end of the month. He calls his \""boss\"" and his \""boss\"" tells him to walk out of the deal. Seriously, after and hour and a half, then he turns around and tells us he bid the job (FOR ONE WINDOW) too low and that he needs to \""walk out on the deal\"" . They are refunding our money for the Living Social deal but I am disappointed and also feel like our time was wasted. The salesman did his job selling us the product, but then tells us he cannot deliver. I would suggest if using this company to be very clear about what they are giving you and be careful on the quotes.",0
"I like eating local whenever possible.  Bub's is pretty decent.  It's not great.  It won't change your life.  It is tasty and edible, though.  I've had better burgers, but not many.

I would go there again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.\n\nMy biggest problem with Bub's is their prices.  For the quality of food they serve, I feel overcharged.",2
"This Hotel is actually pretty cool...\n\nyou just have to know what to expect a lot of the reviews for this hotel are some angry people..ahem..\""HELLO LOOK AT THE PRICE YOUR PAYING FOR YOUR STAY HERE!\"" \n\nIT'S SUPER CHEAP i like it for what it is if i want a High Roller's typa place then i'll gladly head to the Venetian but if your coming to vegas on a budget the riviera is the PLACE to be Clean rooms nothing fancy just a room with your bed and bathroom, the customer service is great and there's a decent buffet in the place......Def coming back here agian if i come back on a budget ...",2
"Good.  Not excellent, not great, but good.\n\nI found it WAY too crowded and noisy for my taste, but I suppose that's a good thing for the restaurant's bottom line, and they probably wouldn't have it any other way.  Things like service-staff training and quality control must be top notch there, because every waitstaff person I have dealt with there is uniformly pleasant, well-informed, fast, and helpful.  Similarly, in the four or five visits I have made, I have never had a QC nightmare with undercooked or overcooked food or screwed up orders - even when my wife ordered a fairly complicated custom sandwich.  For that, they defintiely deserve kudos because it is hard to tolerate inconsistency at a place like this.  But they are indeed consistent.....but unfortunately, it is only consistently \""good\"" food, nothing special, especially at these prices.\n\nThis would be an easy 4-star if they found a way to shave 20% off the prices.  Just too much green for just normal \""good\"" food, if you know what I mean.\n\nBut I like to focus on the positive, so I will say with confidence that the truffle-oil fries are a real treat, and well worth the $6.",2
"My friends and I have been apt shopping today and we've seen quite a few. We drove by and decided to take a look around. We walked in, and after about a minute, a lady walked by and said that someone would be with us. This was said despite the fact that there were two other guys not doing anything when we walked in. She ended up coming back shortly simply saying \""hi guys\"" and not even offering her name nor asking for ours. She was trying to figure out what we were looking for which is standard, it seems. But when I responded to the question of what my \""ideal apartment\"" would have, she simply said \""oh, okay\"". She didn't mention that they had or didn't have the things I was wanting. What was the point of asking me then? The grounds were nice and the pool area was a bit better than some I've seen. The apartment itself looked like the Domain and Dwell Apts, which we were told that the current company bought it from them. I know it was WestCorp, because the brochure still had their info on it. Other than that, she didn't try to get me to leave anything to hold an apartment or offer up any other info that might be helpful. I was asked if there were any other questions I had. I didn't even have motivation to ask. I was done. Not impressed. If that is how a non-resident was treated, I can completely agree with the other bad reviews I've seen for this property. Good luck!",0
"In all, I think you'd do better just by going straight to the box office for the show you want to see. Tix 4 Tonight has some deals, but the seats I got for my show weren't very good (it's a gamble because you don't get to pick) and I had to wait in a very long line (half of the time in the hot sun) until I got to buy them.  They tack on a $5 fee for each ticket also, so it decreases any money you might be saving.  On a positive note, the people who work there are very friendly.",2
"Easily the slowest and dirtiest McDonalds I've been to. My Big breakfast order literally took 17 mins this morning when I asked to talk with the manager, he said it happens and tried to offer me a apple pie. The tables are all filthy. This is the norm for this location.",0
"The hotel was nice however it's not worth the price per night in my opinion. \nWe requested a non-smoking room and all night I smelled cigarette smoke, I'm guessing coming through one of the vents. It was nasty and I didn't want to reek of cigarettes. \nBeautiful water fountain show and elegant decor inside.\nHowever, it's highly overrated.",2
"Invited friends to dinner and drinks there, as we had been there before and enjoyed the experience.  This time, not so much. Arrived with a party of four, and was seated at a table that was too close to the next table on one side (making it hard to get in and out of our seats)' the other side backed to the walkway to the kitchen, making our guest uncomfortable with all the traffic behind them. This was done, even though there were at least 5 or 6 open tables that did not have this issue.\n\nThe appetizers were delivered promptly and were good quality (meat and cheese board with olives) though a bit pricey.  Drinks were ordered, and when I ordered ice tea, was told that they charge for EACH GLASS. I asked about this and was given a lame excuse by the waitress that it is because they brew it by the glass. Later when the Manager delivered some of the food, I questioned this policy stating that this was the only place in AZ that I knew that charged for ice tea by the glass. She gave the same reason and when I stated that it surely did not cost $2.50 to brew more tea, she got defensive and said that \""This is A WINE BAR YOU KNOW\"" \""We don't sell much ice tea.\"" I replied \""No doubt at those prices\"" and asked if she ever heard of the \""Designated Driver\"" that could should not be drinking. She gave no reply and left.\n\nThe food was only fair, I had the shrimp in pasta and cream sauce. The shrimp were large, but the pasta was too dry with only a coating of sauce.  My wife (a vegetarian) ordered the Mac and Cheese and the arugula orange salad. The salad was nothing special. Unfortunately, the Mac and cheese had ham in it, even though it is not listed on the menu. Thus, half of her dinner could not be eaten by her. I tried it. The Mac and cheese was bland with little flavor and again, way too dry.\n\nWhile our friends did not have any issues, they only ate half their meals. Probably too polite to express disappointment to us on our pick for dinner.\n\nThe service  was not timely, had to ask twice for water, because the server forgot, she even stated when asked for the second time, \""Oh I did not know you wanted water\""\n\nAll in all, mediocre and way too pricey for what you get. Probably ok if all you want to do is drink wine and an appetizers, don't bother for dinner.  Was hoping it would be better, but either the Living Room or Postinos have much better service and food for the same cost.",1
"This place was AWFUL. I was using the groupon so I had to call to make a reservation for my friend and I. As soon as I told the receptionist that I would be using the groupon, she tried to hang up on me. I told her she hadn't asked for my name yet, and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise, she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much? She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would \""look bad\"". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. \n\nWhen she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, \""Oh my God\"" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails. We would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon. This was the worst nail experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO TO MAGEN NAIL.",0
"We stopped by this location around 9:25 pm, for a light meal. We ordered one sandwich, an order or fries, popcorn chicken, and ice cream. We sat talking in the car for awhile, and around 9:40 we realized it had been quite a long time. No one came to talk to us or even to take our money until 10 pm. That's right, it took over half an hour for four items. When we received our food, it was cold and the fries were half full. I asked the server to at least bring us some hot food as we had been waiting almost 40 minutes. All she offered was an apology and my ice cream (with no spoon) while she ran back for hot food. I expected at least more acknowledgment of our inconvenience, something. This was the most ridiculous service I've ever had, and having worked fast food for 8 years I feel that I am very understanding about mishaps and service problems. I will never return here.",0
"Stayed here 3/6/12-3/8/12\n\nGot the room comped, 1st time staying here. NASCAR was in town this Sunday and it was a long line to check in.  I say roughly 40-50 people in line and about 5-7 people working the front desk.  Our room was at the Habitat Tower so it was a long ways to get to.  Rooms were decent but the beds were not \""Queen\"" sized.  More like Full.  Dont think we stayed in an updated room.  The good things are that it was smack in the middle of the strip.  Walking distance to everything.  And at time of check out they have kiosks for express check out on the right.  I think it was a manager who helped me check out.  Very patient white man, being I never tried the kiosk check out.  I like more of the piece and quiet type of place so definetely not staying here next time.  I will for sure stay at my Time Share at the Cancun Resort South of the strip.  Very peaceful and super friendly staff.  If you are the party type I would recommend this place.",1
"I like the vibe and the burgers here.  The took away my favorite beer (a rasberry lambic style), but I can understand that something like that is not to everyone's taste!  The only real complaint that I have is that one of the hostesses needs an attitude adjustment.  I went in a couple weeks ago with a dear friend visiting from out of town and wanted to bring her to BrGr for a quick welcome drink when she arrived.  We arrived around 4pm on a weekday, when the place was virtually empty, and asked to sit on the couches (again, the whole area was empty) and the hostess curtly refused to seat us there on the grounds that we weren't eating.  It is my experience that the best way to handle policies like this is to say to the customer that they are welcome to sit where they would like as long as the place is empty, but that if a large table comes in they will have to move.  After all, we just wanted a quick drink and, based on my experience of the place, would have been out before the rush.  In any case, what was a pretty good opinion of the restaurant was seriously soured by this experience.  The hostess wasn't even apologetic, she was off-putting and generally seemed like her decision was based on power and pride, not care for the customer or the business.",1
"What's a good way to start Saturday Morning in Las Vegas....Bagels and Starbucks! \n\nThe breakfast bagels came with cream cheese and we probably got about a dozen bagels. The bagels were tasty, definitely a little hard on the outside but still good. \n\nGot the bagels and headed to the Starbucks drive though :)",2
"Worst Nail Salon Ever!!!\n At first, when you walk in everything looks great. it nicely decorated and everything is clean....but half way through my manicure...i knew that i was in trouble.\nI brought 4 of my girlfriends there for mani/pedi because we were in vegas for my bachelorette party. But Get Nailed was over priced by about $25 and the outcome was a disaster.\n\nWhen you pay over $50 dollars for a mani ped you expect  certain things to come with it like....\nfor your nails to be filed to the same length\nand for the nail polish to set well and not have bubbles and cracks in it 10min later.\nand our nails never fully dried. after 6 hours the pedicures were destroyed by our shoes and my hands looked like my 5 year old niece painted them.\nDon't waste your time or money at this place. I should have demanded my money back!!!!!\nps...the people work there were nice but very unprofessional too!\n2 thumbs down!!!!!",0
"This hotel gets 3 stars. If you are expecting a luxurious hotel, this is not the place to stay. Book a room at the Mirage for that. They have much nicer rooms for the same price. We got the king suite. Very tiny. Not good if you will be spending most of your time in your room. But if you want a cheaper place to stay and will be out and about while you stay here, the NYNY would be adequate.",1
"Great crowd, diversity and I'm not talking about the boat.  Ordered a Corona with grenadine n the whores flocked. I'm starting to like Phoenix . \n\nOn so apparently don't be black in here tho. I got kicked out for literally nothing, it's crazy. They claimed I spilled someone's drink, I even offered to buy the person another drunk but they weren't going for it. Go figure right. Fuck this bar .",0
"Hurry and get there soon before it closes...if you want to waste a meal there...terrible, disgusting...it's like a school lunch one of the kids said...Taco Bell is much better...it's like airplane food another diner said...We had a steak arachera taco plate, enchiladas, taquitos and a bean burrito...the stale chips were an omen and I almost wanted to walk out then!  The food tasted bad like really crumby old leftovers.  The sauce on the enchiladas was like spaghetti sauce...IDK  if they just don't know what good food is...or they don't care!   Yuck, gross...puke!  Don't go and waste time or money at this poor excuse for a restaurant!  I feel bad for tourists who innocently wander in expecting a good meal and end up with this pile of slop!",0
"Spacious rooms, off the strip, you get what you pay for. No frills, bells or whistles. Stayed here for my 30th birthday and we pretty much were out all night and the only time we spent in our hotel room was to nap, basically. Just imagine 5 people crashin' in one room with double beds. \n\nParty weekend..need I say more?\n\nI'd stay here again.",2
"Let me start out by saying that I know many people who LOVE this place and frequent it on a regular basis.  Also, I have worked in a restaurant for the majority of my life (serving, bartending, managing...) so what I am about to say is no exaggeration.  That being said, why does it seem that every time I go there I feel like I walk in with a giant stamp on my forehead reading \""PLEASE IGNORE ME AND GIVE ME TERRIBLE SERVICE\""?????????  \n\nEvery time it takes about 10 minutes to be greeted and another 10-15 to get our drinks (even while sitting at the bar)!   Last time my fianc\u00e9 and I bellied up to the bar the bartender didn't even make contact with us for 15 minutes because he was too busy bragging about that he is the \""best bartender in the world\""- I kid you not!  It was obvious that there were several regulars at the bar, but a bartender needs to know how to schmooze them and pour drinks for others at the same time.  I honestly don't think that guy could walk and chew gum at the same time :-/\n\nNext, when we have actually hung around long enough to get food, it hasn't been that great.  The pancakes tasted like they are the frozen kind you pop in the microwave, the carne asada and eggs dish was sooooooooo greasy we ate about 2 bites, and the bruschetta was bland and the bread tasted like it has fake smoke seasoning on it- which needless to say was totally weird!  \n\nI feel like my family and I have just had bad experiences at BLD and as mentioned above, many people I know love this place!  Having drafts like Papago Orange Blossom will ensure I try this place again sometime- perhaps we will sit in the dining room since the patio and bar have been a bust so far!\n\nPLEASE BLD- I WANT TO LIKE YOU!!!!!\n\nPRO'S- Protein shakes, dog friendly patio, and great craft beer!  \nCON'S- Service, food (so far).....",1
"Ooh, Roosevelt.\n\nThe Good:  They have an awesome selection of beers.  Also, the conversion of an old house into a bar is pretty fun.\n\nThe Bad:  Lighting- on what planet do you require a cell phone to read a menu??  Seriously, I know that I can act like an old lady sometimes, but I shouldn't have to squint to see what's available.  Service- the bartender was actually awesome.  The \""servers\""...I am not sure why they are even there.  There were two gals, and one of them took my initial order for a beer and every few minutes they would walk back into the room, but not once did they ask me or any of the other 3 people I was sitting with if we needed another.  Even though the bar was almost empty.  I had to walk to the bar to order a pretzel (which was delicious), and also walk to the bar to close out my tab.  If the service was better, heck ,even acceptable, I'd probably be giving this review 4 stars.",1
"Well Hello freinds... Hope all is well!!\n\nBiLo is BiLo... \n\nI don't feel much of a need to write a review for a grocery store (even though that's exactly what i'm doing now) except for times when they go OUT of their way for good customer service or when it seems someone (maybe the GM) has gone out of the way as in OUT on lunch. As in OUT of the way of sight, help, cleaning, restocking, removing old, beat up looking produce. \n\nI mean this place reminded me of the old Parking Shop on Wilkerson Blvd back in the days. \n\n-Dark brown mean.\n-No prices on the ground turkey (about 10-15 packs).. NO PRICE LISTED\n-Very brused green bell peppers (Which are actually a chilli, thanks Alton Brown... God I love that guy.. he's like Mr. Wizard, Mr. Rogers and FoodNetwork combined)\nrant over... sorry about that.\n-produce area made me feel like i was at a TJMaxx or something.

"After experiencing more misses than hits here in the past 6 months, I've decided to downgrade my stars from 3 to 2. It's just not very good, and whoever is in the kitchen doesn't understand Vietnamese cuisine at all. I have it from an inside source that they're having difficulty finding trainable staff, and there really doesn't seem to be anyone at the helm here. My lunch today of rice vermicelli with chicken, a dish I've had here dozens of times,  was almost inedible. I mean, it's hard to overcook dark meat from a chicken to the extent that was served up to me today...you've gotta work at it. I suspect that, as business is slow, food is not being prepared to order, but being pre cooked and held; it has that taste to it. The rice noodles themselves had definitely been precooked, and probably been held for longer than a day, as they tasted of refrigerator. Yuck. No more will I be bringing my business here.",1
"hmmmm. Undecided. On the plus side sweet service and pretty nice, clean, tasty food. Cold tofu was good, and variety of rolls all pretty yummy. We were two of four customers, so ambiance waivered between low to non-existent, which is a shame 'cos I really want tiny, holes-in-the wall that do good food to thrive. Decor is a bit tired, and needs a good clean. Ambivalent about returning, hence the 3 star review.",2
"I have to admit that I was disappointed in the food Olives. Service was great and they were very understanding when we were an hour late for our reservation (we called twice). \n\nI really liked the bread they serve in the beginning with the olive tapenade. The warm walnut bread with honey was AMAZING and we even requested more.\n\nStarted the meal with the beet salad and crab beignets and it was just meh. Really didn't have any flavor and wasn't impressed. The crab beignets also were like deep fried crab cakes and not beignets. It didn't do much for me in terms of flavor or taste.\n\nThe main dishes were the portabello mushrooms flatbread and the salmon trio. The flatbread was probably the best thing we ate (except the warm walnut bread rolls...drool...) and you could taste the truffle oil on it too. If you're going to eat there, I'd highly recommend that you order a flat bread.\n\nThe salmon trio was a seared salmon, salmon cake, and salmon tabouli. The seared salmon wasn't anything special but i did appreciate they didn't overcook it. I thought the salmon cake was interesting and probably my favorite of the three. The tabouli wasn't memorable. Not worth $36.\n\nEnded the meal with a vanilla souffle and taste-wise it was fine but the consistency was off. My expectations of a souffle at a Mediterranean restaurant were also not high.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant atmosphere and our waitress was great. I just didn't think the food was really worth the prices and I would not go back again if I was in Vegas.",1
I am sick to my stomach!!  I just had a bug on the lemon in my water.  When addressed with the manager Dan he was unprofessional and failed to provide any sympathy and or apology on behalf of the restaurant. He comped the POTATO CHIPS on our bill!!. I understand stuff happens however its the tact in how the situation is handled when something does go wrong that will make or break the after thoughts of your customer. I will NOT be returning to this restaurant,0
"I'm sorry but you should NEVER have to wait over an hour in the waiting room and then wait more once you're finally in the room! It takes forever to get an appointment with your doctor. The doctor just kept telling me I needed the right cocktail of meds for my migraines even though I've tried just about everything. She had no interest in what I had to say and questioned everything I said, and not in a good way. I'm not sure who they treat but it's not patients! BTW- I experienced the wait time over 3 times I went there. I thought maybe it was just a bad day that first visit but it wasn't.",0
"I can't rate the experience because I didn't really get one. Here is what I can rate: \n\nI went to try H.B. for the first time on Monday (3/25). When I got there, they took my name and the host said 10 minutes. I came back 15 minutes later, and the same host said another 10 minutes. I came back 10 minutes later and a hostess said I still had 2 names ahead of mine and she apologizes \""we are waiting for the servers to catch up\""\n\nI looked inside and there were plenty of seats. I said \""why not bring people off the curb and offer them drinks at least.\"" To which she replied \""sorry, just what my manager said\""\n\nSo I called Citizen Public House and they prepared a table for me on the spot. (IT WAS MONDAY) I won't be trying again. Figured I would mention it, as it could have been easily correctable: \""hey can we get you a drink at the bar while you wait\"" or \""Hey my apologies, we are very understaffed, can we seat you and offer you a beverage\""",0
Ate here again when back in Vegas and I must say I'm so embarrassed I took my mom here! I don't know what happened since our last visit here but it was awful this time and we won't be going back! Too bad we will just have to find another sushi spot when we visit Vegas.,1
"Cleanliness 5 stars\nSelection of Animals for the amount of space they have 4 stars\nSouvenir shop prices, not too bad for plush animals.\nValue per admission price, 1 star\n\nIt is waaaaaaaaaaaaay at the other end of the Mandalay check in area.  just keep walking, and walking, and walking.  You'll know you are in the right place when you see a large kiosk snack\\souvenir area, and the ticket booths will be on the right.  $18 per adult, not a single discount for guests staying at Mandalay.  $36 for my wife and I, free for my toddler at the time.  25 minutes later we were done, and we were not even walking that fast and took the time to take pics where we could.  The paid photo booth is a complete rip off.\n\nI would NEVER pay to come here again.",1
"Sadly this is the only good Fry's near my house which I occasionally frequent if I don't make the trek to Mesa or Chandler for grocery shopping. I don't know, something about going into a store that regularly has two security officers makes me feel like I am heading into a prison or something. I always feel like there are eyes on me or something, creepy. The store itself is pretty nice, small selection on the organic though, and the evenings are pretty slow. It is located in a strip mall to get all your shopping done all in one spot: Gamestop, Target, restaurants, Great Clips, ACE, Anna's, Ross, etc.",2
"This place is horrible since the owner changed to Food Express! The prices have risen since then. I would understand if the food was outstanding or if it was an upscale restaurant, but please, its nowhere close. The food quality has degraded to levels worst than I can describe. The food that came out was so cold and tasteless we couldn't even eat it. The waiters and including the manager treated us like 3rd class citizens. These people even charged us $1.50 per bowl of rice. We had to remind them 3 times before they even delivered it to us. Our dishes all came out before our rice was even served. They used to give you hot dessert after your meal, but not anymore. I would advise not to come here even if you were playing table games, if they comp you or give you half off. You're better off driving to Chinatown and going to HK Star for a authentic and worthwhile experience. This place ruined our night.",0
This is a review of the male dance review\nA girlfriend and I went to this club on a Sunday night. The strippers were mostly amatuers and they all danced like girls.

"Good pizza, definitely better than the national delivery chains, but not nearly as good as the top notch pizzeria's we are blessed with. That being said their prices are actually higher than the best places (Grimaldis, Spinatos, Quattro al Formagio, Humble pie, Pomo , Grazi, Bianco, The Cove). So - I recommend NYPD if you are really hungry for Pizza and can't get to one of these other places, or for home delivery - and look for a coupon.",2
"Will this be my last review of a Starbucks? Perhaps not, but it will be the last time I visit this one.\n\nI was not impressed with anything here. The wait, the line, the service the flavor of the coffee - not up to Starbucks standards for sure!\n\nI may not be a coffee expert, but I know that this place needs some massive changed. Even the staff came in inadequate. Thank goodness for Jamba Juice or I'd be very thirsty at this airport!",1
"I used to love this place, I had been a customer for almost 8 years.  I havent been by there in a while and wanted a good pizza.\nThe food was horrible.  The pizza uses such a low quality peperoni that when cooked, coats the pizza in yellow orange grease.  The salad was old with rusty lettuce, and the chicken wings were that greasy oily mess you get when they dont change the fryer oil often enough.\nSAVE YOUR MONEY DONT EAT HERE!!!!!!",0
"We traveled to Point Brugges last night from Mt. Lebanon, specifically in order to satisfy a craving for mussels. We waited about 10 minutes for a table, were seated, ordered beer, and only then were we told that they were out of mussels!!! What a disappointment.  Other than that we had a decent meal, the beer+cheese soup was good, the fries were transcendent, but we probably wouldn't have come all the way out to the East End on a Sunday evening just for those things.  Oh well, c'est la vie",2
"today was bad. seriously pathetic. I've eperienced better service from this store and others.  \n\n1. when trying to look for someone on the shop floor - NO ONE could be seen.  not even at the doors.\n\n2. I was looking at the inspire range for belts and they only had one after i enquire at the till after standing in LOooooooong queue.\n\n3. not once, not twice but three times the lady at the till buzzed for other staff members to come and reduced the queue and even after a forth buzzer no one came - pathetic.  Really felt sorry for the lass as i've been in that situation and it's not nice.  \n\nI did get a belt though rather please with myself.   The store did need a tidy up though.",1
"I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.\n\nThe servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!\n\nNow for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).\n\nStrike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!\n\nIf you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!",0

"Came here again.. this place is good.. we like it.. it has yummy pizzas, it's BYOW, and has a lively atmosphere.. there's just something a bit miss with the service I feel.. you constantly feel rushed, the staff barely stand still to take your order and midway through appetizers (at about $15 each) mains are slammed down as soon as they're ready followed by the check mid meal.. everything is attended to it just seems rushed and a bit frustrated.. my wife made the observation that it was all male staff, and maybe they need a female on the team, which we thought was funny..\n\notherwise we like it.. great pizzas, but it'd be nice if the guys took 4.5s to just say and act out some basic pleasantries etc. at $30 per person, i don't think it's that crazy to feel a need for..",2
"I remember growing up, Olive Garden was the \""fancy\"" place for a family dinner. It was the place my parents took me and my sister to celebrate a good report card, a local competition win, or a special birthday. This is also where I took my date for our first high school homecoming dinner. \n\nFast forward 15 years, my well traveled older self have come to realize that this is far from the authentic Italian food that has established itself amongst world cuisine with its fresh, rustic ingredients and detailed workmanship in the kitchen. But there are a few things here that still have me coming back after all those years of cultural growth:\n\n(In no particular order)\n-Great drink selections\n-Endless soup with any entree\n-Zuppa Toscana\n-Dolcini (guilt-free cup sized mini deserts)\n-All day lunch portions served at reduced prices\n-Prompt service and friendly staff\n-Consistent quality\n\nSo next time you're in town and not sure where to go, there is something for everyone at the Olive Garden.",2
If you advertise an industry night and I call about said night please inform us that there is a private party before 10 of us walk up expecting to bowl. When we call to make a reservation just tell us you are closed for the night before we all plan on being there.,0
"Came here on a Sunday night. We enjoyed the ambiance. It was a big dining space but at least half full. The service was also good. But the food was just OK. We ordered a white sangria, pretty tasty and very little alcohol -- just the way we like it. We also got a side salad that was fine, but not memorable. The shrimp fresca pasta was extremely buttery but not very salty, and the shrimp were overbreaded. The tenderloin tips were also OK with the beef being a bit chewy. We would probably go to Cheesecake Factory next time we're in the mood for big portions of classic American fare.",2
I was really disappointed tonight! My baguette was a little soggy and the cafe sua da was definitely not the same. Let's hope these kinks get worked out in due time because I know a lot of us have been waiting for Vegas to get a Lee's for a long time now.,1
"My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a nice steak and raved about Strip House in New York and said I would love it if Las Vegas location was same as New York. The waiter was awesome, but when we received our steak, it didn't taste the same. He asked for the steak to be split becasue it was a large cut. I am not a steak eater so I don't know when a cut is bad. His cut was great, but I kept chewing and chewing and eventually I gave him some of my cut to see. He noticed I was struggling, but assumed I was chewing slow. He spit his piece out and asked to speak to the Manager. He let the waiter know how he felt and was disappointed with my cut. They said it was from the same cut, but he disagreed. The Manager approaches and his response to our complaint was highly unprofessional. He comments were uncalled for when situation was explained. He said you ate it so nothing can be done about it even though he was told I wasn't a seasoned steak eater. He lied saying he came from new York location when my boyfriend mentioned names, he was clueless. He was very immature and childish and defensive. His hospitality skills were horrible, customer skills even worse and all he did was remove the side dishes ordered. We were not looking for a free meal, but something to be done to rectify serving a bad cut of steak which was a pretty penny. My boyfriend was outraged at the poor service the Manager gave portrays Strip House to be a place that doesn't care if a patron is satisfied or not. I cannot recommend this location due to his performance and will let the New York location know of our horrible experience in Las Vegas.",0
"I met some friends here for dinner and drinks, finding the place is a little tricky especially if you don't make frequent trips Uptown. \n\nThey offer valet but I'd suggest just parking I the BoA parking garage and taking the elevator down to the restaurant. The atmosphere is fine, nothing fancy but you should expect it from a BBQ joint. The place wasn't busy so we were seated right away. \n\nThe menu is not very extensive, but includes all the classics : ribs, pulled pork and brisket just to name a few items. For starters we ended up ordering some wings. It's not a bad deal for just $5 you get half a dozen wings with blue cheese and some other dipping sauce. The wings were very tasty! The came out hot and packed with flavor. \n\nFor my meal I went with the pulled pork sandwich and cheese grits. Meh, it was okay. I've had better pulled pork at other BBQ places and they didn't really give a lot of meat on the sandwich....more bun than meat is no bueno!!! The cheese grits were decent...but again nothing to write home about. If I came back I'd stick with the wings. \n\nSo why the low score??? Aside from the average food the waitress/bartender had a horrible attitude. I've said this before and I'll say it again....if customer service is NOT your thing....please do us all a favor and pick another job!!! Shitty service ruins the experience and meal every time! Even if the food had been better I'd have to strongly consider give my money to someone who rolls their eyes at me and my guests AND ignores my requests while I'm eating (excuse me for needing a refill on my drinks and extra napkins....ugh!). \n\nSo try this place at your own risk...or just grab some wings to go!",1
"Yesterday I needed to meet a client from North of the valley and I had other customers to visit in Deer Valley.  There are not many places in the area open for breakfast that are not chains so I picked here.  Getting there at 8 I probably missed most of the folks getting breakfast or picking up a sandwich to take with them for lunch. The guy who runs the place has almost an attitude but you warm up to him pretty quick.  \n\nI ordered the Max burrito which comes with egg, potato, cheese and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham ($4.29). It was pretty tasty.  It is moderate sized.  Price per ounce is easily twice that of a similar burrito at most of the local Mexican fast food places.  Part of that cost is location (Deer Valley is not cheap) and employee cost.\n\nWhile I was there there was a steady stream of folks coming in but never really busy.  It is hard sometimes to get in the parking area because of the backup for the Dunkin Donut located at the other end of the building.\n\nI am sure I will go back again because it isn't a chain, the food was OK and the service was pleasant.",2
"I can only speak for this location but the Thrifty here sucks!! I booked through Hotwire and got the bullet on this round of russian roulette. \n\nLet me set the scene.....Friday afternoon around 4:00. We walked up and were second in line, \""sweet\"", I thought foolishly. It took 35 minutes for the ONE person in front of us to be helped. There were two agents for the Thrifty side and the one chunky black guy in the suit was chatting it up with people for about 5 minutes out in the lobby area after escorting someone down to the car pick up area. Then he comes up and screws around on the computer for nearly 5 minutes before seeing a large breasted women with a low cut dress in the Dollar line and helping her before us (and we're a good looking couple in our late 20's not exactly hard to look at)! She literally had just walked up and was helped immediately while our line had now grown to at least 15 people. I was about to explode at this point but calmer heads prevailed and I could not be 100% sure he was a Thrifty agent since he was right by the line between the two (after we had been helped I saw him helping the person behind us so he was definitely a Thrifty agent). The older white lady with red hair helped us and was very pleasant but at this point I was not really interested in her chit chat. \n\nSoooo if getting a car in a timely manner and being helped by professional agents is not a big deal then by all means choose Thrifty! If you are a normal person and hate poor customer service and crappy management then look elsewhere. You have been warned!!",0
"Exactly as my rating states, it's just meh.\n\nI wouldn't mind going back and trying something else, but I did not like my burger, it was fine, but not for the price. A little suggestions on what ingredients to pair would've been nice. My black angus patty was crumbling all over the place and my entire burger fell to pieces. To top it off, the zucchini fries tasted and looked store bought :O( Better luck next time...",1
"I would really give it 2 1/2 stars if I could...but I grade on a curve. \n\nThis place is fine. It is basic american-chinese food. It is better than buffet-places, but like other reviewers have said - there is better Chinese food available in pittsburgh.  (ie. China Palace in Shadyside)\n\nThey have a good lunch special and the service is pretty fast for a large dining room. The location is great. It is a good lunch spot downtown to sit, have lunch, and be on the go within an hour.  \n\nYou will not impress a date or client with this place...you (or they) could do better.  But for a get-out-of -the-office for an hour lunch with friends, this will do just fine.\n\nThe restrooms are weirdly outside the restaurant in the lobby of the YMCA.  Which is fine, just weird.",2
"So our office tried something different for lunch than our more frequented 'renovated home\"" type restaurants that we usually go to in downtown Phoenix. Because this is close to a place we usually go \""That's a Wrap\"" we decided we'd try this place out for take out too.  The parking lot is a bit odd because its large/loose gravel....but there seemed to be plenty of spaces so that def. a bonus!  The atmosphere was really laid back and really pleasant. Very friendly staff seemed to be everywhere, so that was nice too. \nMy order was a take out order for about 10 people in my office. I thought for sure I'd be taking out 4 bags...but they had very economical/green packaging (paper boxes and paper wrappings) . So it was nice to only see 3 bags (once I got the food...which unfortunately took 40 mins. instead of 20 to prepare). But hey, it was busy and I had almost 10 orders...so no biggy. As far as the food, they didn't have baked beans as they state on their menus, nor did they have steak for their steak tacos. (weird...it wasn't even 12p yet and they were out of food?!) Back at the office, everyone enjoyed the food. It wasn't anything over the top nor was it 'plain'. So compliments to Coronado Cafe for that (usually some places are too froo froo for me downtown).  I had gotten the portobello sandwich w/ potato salad. The sandwich was very yummy. It  had onions, cheese and other ingredients and was on focaccia bread which added just the right amt. of flavor to the sandwich. \n\nAlthough the food is good, I do wish the food wasn't as expensive as it was. (For I know the 1/2 sand. and 1/2 salad combo, that others ordered from the office,  really wasn't that big of a portion). All in all...nice little place with good food. Try it out!",2
This Starbucks has really went down in the last 4-5 months. Never same staff and drink consistency is horrible. I used to love going here staff was so nice and now I will be hitting a different one. I wish Starbucks would pay attention to YELP. I see a lot of unhappy customers in the last few months.  Maybe time for management change turn it back around.,0
"Decent Mexican - in particular, Oaxacan-style cuisine.  As like every hotel/casino based restaurant, it is exceedingly overpriced.  Drinks are ok - I ordered a glass of $10 sangria - I've had better.\n\nPrior to your meal, you get your chips and dip; but you get three different types of dip with an herbal/salt accompaniment.  It was generally ok, so it was fine to eat this while biding time for my entree.\n\nThe enchilada platter was pretty good, but again - I've had better.  My friend had chicken tacos - again, there's been better.\n\nMy last name is Diego, and so we had a fun time trying to convince our waiter to give us a discount because I share the same name as the restaurant (walking promotion, right?)  Of course, it didn't work.",2
"Food was decent for a buffet, nothing spectacular but decent Chinese food. They filled the drink glasses as soon as they were empty so that was nice as well. The bathrooms left a LOT to be desired for cleanliness. The doughnuts are worth going for if you get them when they first come out! Man they were good!!",2
I don't see what the big deal is about this place. Yeah the view is nice and all but the food is pretty average at best. We both had the crab cakes and they were horrible! And the service sucks. We were pretty much ignored the whole time during our meal after the food came. \n\nThe bartenders kept giving a women who was all ready clearly drunk more drinks. And she fell on her face right in front of our table and almost knocked it over with no apology from management.\n\nI should've gone to The Capital Grille instead.,1
"I love bbq and had been waiting a while to go this place, because I wasn't sure if it was a good restaurant or not. So I decided to visit recently and ordered a lunch dish with baby back ribs, chicken, and beef, with a side of mashed potatoes. My mother could make better ribs with more meat on them than what I had received at this restaurant. The sauces were disgusting and the waiter didn't even bother to give us biscuits even though they were complimentary. I tried the chicken, but it wasn't anything as expected and was definitely not up to par, this being a bbq restaurant. I didn't even try the beef and for three people we ended up paying around $65 with the tip for a very unsatisfied lunch and setting. I will not come back to this place of establishment.",0
"I read reviews for movies, restaurants and products all the time. How did I forget to read the reviews before dropping $200 on this show I don't know. I've always wanted to see it. I heard they changed it after a performer died, but I still thought it would be good. I was wrong. I wish I had seen it years ago before they changed it. We were not impressed, and there's too many other shows to see.  It was my girlfriends first Cirque show, and she didn't like it. Where's the acrobatics she asked? I didn't have an answer, as I was wondering the same thing. Go see Mystere or O at Bellagio if you want a Cirque de Soleil show, chances are you'll be disappointed with this one.",1
"I went here for dinner tonight as part of a work outing.  I ordered a cup of the pozole and the machaca plate.  The salsa was good.  The chips seem to have been salted six to seven times.  Not appealing.  The pozole was sweet.  When the waiter asked me how it was I was honest.  He told me said, \""sweet?  I've never gotten that out of the pozole\"".  Nice people skills.  Try an apology or something nicer than basically saying I was wrong. The machaca was salty to the point of inedible.  The refried beans were extremely salty as well.  My coworkers complained of the same saltiness in their meals.  Their cook needs to learn how to season the food.  Or maybe taste it before you send it out.  I'm going back to San Diego tomorrow and I'm going to get some good pozole.  I would rather dumpster dive for food than eat here again.",0
"This place is a cute little cube in the middle of a sad, thrift store parking lot with a drive-thru liquor store. However, they've created a nice atmosphere that is somehow enjoyable. \n\nI went for \""Happy Hour\"" and was shocked that their happy hour menu pricing was $9-$10 for a glass of wine! Made me wonder what their prices were normally? Yikes. There were no appetizers or food specials either. However, the place was packed, so apprently they don't need to offer attractive deals to get the after-work crowd.\n\n The service was completely overwhelmed and uninformed, but geniuine and sweet and I wasn't in a hurry so it was fine.\n\nThis is likely a great place for coffee, lunch, etc. But I definitely won't be back for happy hour. There are just too many other places where I can get enjoy a drink after work without going into debt.",2
"I've been to Hickory Tavern 3 times now.  All 3 times, during lunch.\n\n1st time @ Mallard Creek - 2 people - build your own salad.  Impressive and thoughtful menu item.  Great options.  Kudos for this.  The cucumber wasabi dressing is amazing.\n\n2nd time @ Harris - group of 8 - burger and fries.  Meh.  Pretty standard fare bar food.  At least the beer was cold.\n\n3rd time (16SEP2014) @ Harris went something like this - 3 people.  11:15 - get seated by greeter, total of 5 customers in the restaurant.  11:20 - people around us are getting their drink and food orders taken, some of these people came in after us, we have not been greeted by a server.  11:30 - drinks and food start hitting tables around us.  11:35 - still not greeted by a server, so we stood up and left.  As we left, I made eye contact with the bartender, I'm sure anger and disappointment was over my face.  I don't have a shred of tolerance when it comes to being ignored in a restaurant.\n\nI make it a rule to avoid places that disappoint me like the plague, poor service being the worst offense.  There are many options in Charlotte for places to have lunch, this one is off the table for me.  If you don't want to send a server to my table, you can't have my business.",0
"It is unfathomable to me how a place full of dbag hipsters and the nouveau riche can manage to be so sh*tty and pretentious serving mediocre food and awful beer. Customer service is nonexistent here and the place routinely smells like vomit. Seriously, what is that smell??? Much be the stink of the attitudes. Have been here with friends twice for celebrations. Would never voluntarily return with SO many better options in the neighborhood. Ugh. Hope this deliberately trendy place crashes and burns and makes space for a real, quality brewery and not something thrown up with a ton of money to attract past-their-prime frat boys trying to act like they can stomach something other than Bud.",1
"So. I just got back from Vegas, and stayed at, of course.. The Palazzo.  Well, I must say.. couple months really did some damage to the casino.  Can't believe I'm going to give this place 2 stars but whatever has got to be done.\n\n(1) Service just got horrible.  It went from a solid A to a very average C.  And trust me, average is not acceptable in Vegas. With all the competition they have, it was very disappointing experience this time around.  From the front desk to the casino credit, it was very just average.  Maybe even a little below for the price they charge you for room.\n\n(2) Room was still big and comfortable as I remember. But can the cleaning service be upgraded?! If the room wasn't comped, I would've been even more mad... but because it was free, I can't complain that much right? But at $350/night regularly, it was quite annoying that the cleaning lady could not distinguish lotion between conditioner.  I was in the shower, shampooed my hair, great.  Time to condition my hair... but wait, what is this, the lotion? Since when did people lotion their body in the shower? Very irritating when it took me almost an hour brushing my hair just because someone can't distinguish between lotion & conditioner.  Also, I was looking for my glasses that I left on the nightstand for about an hour, only to realize that the cleaning lady decided to tuck it into the bottom drawer. (Even though I specifically told them not to clean anything BUT the bathroom). Ugh.\n\n(3)  Gaming wise... wow. Must say, pit boss's and dealers got super unfriendly.  Maybe they've been running into some not-so-great players, but honestly, what's up with the service?  Here we go again on the service.  Unacceptable, especially when the Wynn & Encore is just a bridge away.\n\n(4)  They charge you for an extra fridge and late-check out now. What? I know they're going bankrupt and all, but c'mon now. Are you really going to scare away your loyal customers so you can get a few bucks here and there?  I have never been charged for an extra fridge nor the late check out.  But this trip made me realize... The Palazzo really must be DESPERATE!\n\n(5) They don't comp cigarettes anymore. Wow. What else are you going to take, free alcohol? The Pit boss told me that it was because of health issues and regulations.  I assumed that this was all of Las Vegas's new rule and thought it was quite dumb but still let it slide.  Next day, I went to the Wynn/Encore to play, and the pit-boss comped cigarettes like nothing.  I was confused.  I then told the pit-boss what the Venetian/Palazzo told us about the cigarettes and all he said was, \""The Palazzo is still around\"" and laughed.  Seriously.  They're still around? They need to honestly up their game.\n\nMy loyalty has really gone down in the drains with this trip.  On the up side, theres always Wynn/Encore.",1
"Just had lunch in their newly remodeled store.  This was by far the worst lunch we've had in quite some time.  Server brought my order and not my dining partner's.   The waitress checked back later and said the other order was \""dropped\"" and was reordered. Both food orders were awful.  It is hard to ruin a simple hamburger and onion rings but they managed quite easily.  The table behind us had their order messed up too.   We will definitely NOT be going back!",0
"It was an alright place to stay. My room was clean and spacious. The bed was huge which was a plus for because I move around a lot in bed. They had and iron and ironing board which I needed desperately. Plenty of towels. Didn't have a coffee machine which I thought was standard now in hotels and motels; lose one star. They're \""all-inclusive\"" breakfast consisted of cereal and store bought danishes; another star lost. And everytime I was in the lobby, the receptionists were dealing with some angry customer, either in person or on the phone. All in all, my experience was pretty good.",2
"Does anyone who actually lives here ever buy anything here? I never have. The prices are ridiculous and the shit ain't that good, because ultimately let's face it: they're scouring Las Vegas for the best vintage clothing. LAS VEGAS.\n\nNay, this store is a trap and a lie. Our arts district deserves a better second hand clothing store.",1
"This hotel could get either a 5-star or 1-star rating, depending on one's priorities. I chose to rate it 3, because as much as I loved the decor and the interior, a hotel should offer a safe haven- a place to quietly enjoy the night and morning hours. Unfortunately, while we thoroughly enjoyed the furnishings, the gym, and the service in the hotel, we were simply unable to sleep. \nThe problem wasn't with anything the hotel had any control over, but rather its location. It is in a very vibrant section of downtown Scottsdale, surrounded by bars and nightclubs that attract a loud and youthful clientele. We were there three nights, from Thursday through Sunday, and were unable to catch even a wink of sleep prior to 3:30am on any of those nights, despite being very sleep-deprived from each night's noisy surroundings. \nBetween the car alarms and the voices carrying through the desert air all the way to our fifth floor room, the sleepability of the hotel was simply untenable. \nBottom line- if sleeping is important to you, and or you are not nocturnal, and or you do not wear ear-plugs to sleep, you should avoid this hotel like the plague.",2
"I used to get takeout from here a lot. When I lived closer. It is really fine. Nothing to get excited about, but not terrible. I had the Pad Thai lunch special and it is nice that they use breast meat. I thought that it was too sweet and it is weird that it comes with rice. The fried rice is not great. Not bad tasting, just plain and not worth eating, really.   The service was very friendly.",2
It's not the cheapest pizzeria in the area but consistency is what I like most about Pizza Express. \n\nMy delicious favourite pizza tastes and looks exactly the same each time we go there. \n\nPersonally I have always found the well-trained staff to be attentive and professional in every way. However the atmosphere is a bit sterile and it's more of a lunchtime or teatime venue. I wouldn't choose it for a special night out.,2
Well on 5/29/14 I took my car in to get a wash and oil change. As they did a good job on interior part of my car etc my E-Cig ($80) battery was stolen out of my car from there. It is a lesson learned from me as you can't trust having your important stuff in your car while you wait. I know nothing will happen from this but as I work in auto industry (sell online diagnostic resourse) I will make sure this company has to pay highest prices for are software and will never return unless I need gas real bad and I am driving by. If I catch one of the employees at rush hour etc I feel bad for them. O my e-cig is missing well then how did that black eye get there;) Anyway screw them.,0
Fast and efficient although I would say I hardly ever have a supurb car-wash at this place even if I get the works. I always feel rushed to leave so when I end at my final destination I have to do a once around and get all little bits they missed myself. \nI would still say they do an adequate job especially since my car is always really dirty by the time I take it in... plus they are good about putting coupons out into the market so keep an eye out for them and save a few more bucks. \nAnd don't forget to tip the guys washing your car... it's hot and humid outside and they appreciate it.,2
"Any Cirque du Soleil shows are guaranteed to be a spectacle-- and sure enough Le Reve was no different. As much as I enjoyed watching hot men with hard abs jumping into water at great heights, 75 minutes of it was more than enough. Honestly, they lost me 20 minutes into the show. Maybe I don't appreciate the art-- but I really didn't get the storyline at all! I understand it's suppose to be \""A Dream\"" but a dream about what?! Hot men running around being hot? Fine, guess that's quite a dream.\n\nWe sat in the splash zone and barely felt any splash! Any seat in the theater is a good one but if you're looking to save yourself a little cha-ching.. do the splash zone!",2
"Had dinner there last night with a friend.  We had an Asian waiter who appeared to be the owner (30-40s with glasses) and asked him for his recommendation.   He gave us the look \""are you serious\"" and we felt as if we shouldn't have asked.  After the awkward pause, we asked again and he made an effort to recommend their signature dish: bulgogi bibimbap ($15).   The restaurant wasn't too busy, about 35-40% filled on a Monday night.  The food was good and I'd rate it 4/5 for the bibimbap.  Before we left, I asked the owner about how to go about fixing my cracked dolsot (hot stone bowl).  He didn't seem to care and replied \""Oh you can't fix it\"".  It was an another awkward moment and perhaps I shouldn't have asked.  Trying to carry the conversation to avoid the awkwardness, I remarked, \""Dolsots are expensive.\""  He asked, \""How much did you get it for?  \""$30\"" I replied.  He then condescendingly replied, \""That's cheap.  Ours is more expensive. It's commercial.\""  The owner needs to work on his customer service skills.  In all fairness, he did do a good job refilling our water and we gave him the standard tip, despite his poor attitude. Bottom line:  Food 4/5, Price 2.5/5, Service 3/5.",1
"Awful. We went for happy hour and ordered nachos and beer. The nachos were pathetic and made with cheese sauce and a very few pieces of chicken. My sister in law had chicken quesadilla and it had three pieces if chicken. To top it off, they opened the garage doors at 6:00, causing the inside temp to be 90 degrees. When we talked to the manager, he responded there was nothing he could do. Never going back.",0
"I'm happy for the one person who likes this place but honestly my biggest problem is that out of $500 deposit I got back $2.33! They painted every wall in the place. I was there for one year, I didn't put up art and I don't have a kid to draw on the walls. Why did they spend half of my deposit to paint the walls?!? If they even did, its not like I could verify that it was actually done. That's why Pala Mesa sucks. Also, they're in the ghetto, just FYI, and they're expensive as hell for the location. Light rail sure, but also hooker motels, tweaker trailer parks and constant police copters overhead looking for criminals in the area.",0
"My friends and I are on a road trip from Sacramento, CA to Austin, TX and wanted good subs. When we opened them in the car we saw that there was barely any meat on the sandwiches and all the pickles were pretty disgusting.  We do not understand why this place has such a great rating....we do not recommend it at all.",0
"I'm going to reiterate what other reviewers have said previously. The service is completely lacking here. The servers - while friendly - take an exorbitant amount of time to come to your table. The kitchen - while making incredibly tasty food - is unacceptably slow. And the price you pay for both is just far too much for what you get. \n\nAs for kid/family friendly, I would try somewhere else or get carry out. This place is a brewpub that tries to be good for families, but in the end it's still just a bar.\n\nTasty food but not enough to make up for the other detractors.",1
"Although they have a good selection of cheeses, the store and their employees are definitely NOT kid friendly.   A very bad experience 3 yrs ago with one of the owners was so bad that it caused us not to set foot in the store again.\n\nIf you have kids, save your aggravation and don't bother going into the store. Fragile & glass items are set very low on the shelves and easily accessible from a stroller.   The store is so tight that you will have a hard time keeping your stroller or kids away from the items. If there are other people in the store, you will have no choice but to move closer to the shelves which becomes too temping for kids no to want to touch something....  And if your kids do touch something, you may get a scolding from an owner by reminding you that  items on the shelves are fragile and can break. Seriously, anyone telling me that a glass bottle or jar can break is just being rude... we get it... duh,  glass can break!  Maybe if glass items were not 2 ft off the floor, it wouldn't be such a big deal.  Unfortunately our experience is not isolated. We have friends who experienced the same thing at Formagination.   \n\nSo take this review into consideration - if you are with young children and are coming from the toy store just a few doors down, think again about walking into this store with them. You may just walk right back out and thinking to yourself, is this store really worth the hassle?  You may just find yourself going back to a local grocery store, co-op or cheese factory store for your cheese needs.",0
Was told to be here for a drug screening mandated by work at noon. I get here at noon and they tell me I'm looking at a 45 minute wait. Receptionist seems very unfamiliar with her position. Very very frustrating experience. *** finally seen after over an hour wait. Nurse was nice but I hope I never have to come here again.,0
"Visited Olives with the Hubs the night we landed in Vegas for a conference. I had made reservations online, specifically requesting a table out on the patio overlooking \""lake\"" Bellagio, and when we arrived, a table hadn't cleared yet. We didn't mind, and took two seats at the bar. There, I enjoyed the most delicious lemon-flavored cocktail, complete with sugar-rimmed martini glass & all! \n\nSoon, our table was ready & I have to say that we got a fantastic table, the perfect spot for me & the Hubs, right on the lake's railing... perfection. At least for Las Vegas :-)\n\nWe ordered another round of drinks and awaited the arrival of our entrees. The bread & olive tapanade served while we waited was nice, but nothing to go crazy for. I ordered a special of the evening - shrimp & pasta. Unfortunately, the shrimp looked a bit like fishing bait and I located a number of small shells throughout the dish, but the overall fresh, creamy lemon flavor was good - I wouldn't order it again. The hubs ordered a fish special of the evening, along with some asparagus, which he raved about. \n\nWe opted for a third round of drinks and some fountain-gazing after our meal, since we weren't \""feeling\"" the desserts at Olives.\n\nOverall the experience was lovely, drinks were killer, albeit a bit on the pricey side (it is Vegas, after all) and our table out on the patio was to die for. A great Vegas experience, not necessarily a great Vegas meal.",2
"I went here yesterday for lunch with friends. The food was pretty good, as usual (I had chicken parmesan and my fiance had an alfredo dish, which he said wasn't that good) but this time the service wasn't as superb. My fiance's silverware was dirty, and my Pepsi tasted flat. I ended up just drinking water. \n\nOur initial waitress mysteriously disappeared after getting our drinks... another waiter took over and said that the other waitress had to \""take off.\"" This was kind of confusing, because we saw her waitressing other tables right by us. Plus, I never like it when there are about 5 different people stopping by your table. One guy asked if we wanted more bread, and we said yes, and then he never brought the bread basket back. Different people brought out our dishes... and, nearing the end our waiter kept asking us if we needed anything (we were just sitting there talking), which made us feel like he wanted us to leave. I think we would have understood this had it been extremely busy and a long wait, but there was hardly anyone there!",2
I came to this location looking for beef ribs and was annoyed that they didn't carry them.  However I did notice that the meat they did carry looked amazing and were priced surprisingly cheap.  I picked up a package of amazing pork chops for $4!  The parking lot is a little crazy and the lines were slow and ridiculously long; seriously it took over ten minutes to check out.,2

"Went here for lunch. They had one server working which slowed things down but not enough to complain about, the server still did a pretty good job but I could see the more sensitive type knocking off for it. The food took a bit but the portions are pretty big. My wife got a bean and cheese  chimi and I got the Mexican pizza. The Mexican pizza was pretty much a cheese crisp folded over with some type of green chili. The Mexican pizza wasn't bad, about 3-31/2 stars and my wife liked her dish ok but nothing too good. The beans were not the best and nor was the guacamole. The soda was flat and tasted pretty bad. The chips and salsa were nothing to write home about. But again, the portions are big and the food is decent but I doubt we'll be back anytime soon.",2
"One of the high end casino at Vegas.  A must stop.  A very large elegant casino, nice high end shops, the best fountain show ever, great rooms and a tram that connects you to other casinos like the Aria and Monte Carlo.  Next door to Cosmopolitan and across the street from Paris and Planet Hollywood. And on the corner  with a bridge to connect to Caesars, Flamingo and Bally's.  What a great location.  So why only 3 stars?  The shops are nice but the mall is small.  When you see the Caesar Forum or the Miracle Mile Shops or the Grand Canal Shoppes, this one will disappoint you.  The high end restaurants are kind of boring.  The reward program doesn't reward you.  I seem to lose here more often than the other casinos.  If the rates are reasonable, I would stay here all the time, but since they are not, I don't.  It still a must do while in Vegas.",2
"I went in to speak with this dealership about trading my car in, it was 845pm and they didn't close until 10pm.  I was met by a salesman, test drove the Lexus I saw on line and had them appraise my Lexus.  I had a guy come over to me on 3 different occasions that was very very rude to my husband and I, and never introduced himself to me.  I was there looking to spend nearly $40k on a car, so I do expect decent service.  The sales man asked if I met the finance manager, I said I'm not sure some very rude and demanding guy kept coming over and never introduced himself to me.  He apologized for the guys behavior and said he would introduce us once he came back.  The \""gentleman\"" and I use the term loosely because I guess it just sounds better than asshole, came back again and said he needed me to tell him what I want to spend on the car....?!?!!? WHAT?!?!?! Um I asked him to tell me what the numbers were looking like, he again said \""you need to answer my question\"" So I proceeded to tell him he has been rude since I got there and treated us awfully.  If you don't want to be at work at 9pm...go home but don't treat people like crap and expect people who don't know who the hell you are to discuss their finances with you.  And then he told us we needed to leave.  I called the dealership to file a formal complaint the next day and they refused to transfer me to someone that could assist, I sent an email on their website, and contacted the head of sales via email and have not heard back from anyone.  Per the website...this fellow who is oh so sweet and friendly is the Finance Director.  I would figure the dealership would try to do some form of damage control or at least try to say sorry for their employee treating us like shit.  Needless to say, I'd rather buy a brand new car from Lexus for $40k and be treated like a human and not like someone that is a waste of time.  Needless to say, this was by far the worst experience Ive ever had with a dealership and Id advise you go anywhere other than there if you want to buy a car",0
"Several years ago we dined a few times at this restaurant and were not impressed, but I had points to burn and the current menu indicated 21-day, dry aged beef is now being served so we (actually I) decided to give it one more try - silly me.  \n\nEntrees include a choice of potato and salad with my wife choosing garlic mashed that were puree like and garlic-lite.  My baker with sour cream was better.  The salads were primarily iceberg lettuce that had been topped with diced tomatoes, a couple of olives and red onion tossed in for good measure and dressed with bottled blue cheese.  \n\nThough our slabs of cow were served medium rare as requested, it took a Herculean effort to just to cut them into bite sized pieces.  Our server seemed to be on auto pilot and never once stopped by to inquire if we need anything or had concerns.  This was proved to be by far the most disappointing meal of our entire 14 day vacation.",1
"We stayed for one Saturday night. That was probably the appropriate amount of time to stay, because I never really did feel settled in. The people at the front desk were nice, but were almost trying too hard to sound American if you know what I mean. The hostel has its own bar with decently priced beers (\u00a32 for a Tiger) and a good breakfast complete with haggis. They also had laundry facilities on site. It cost \u00a31 for the dryer, which doesnt sound bad but we needed to put our clothes through twice to get them dry and it wasn't even a quarter full (we only put in what we were wearing as they had gotten soaked in the rain). Also, it was really loud outside on a Saturday night. Overally, it was good enough especially for the cheap price.",2
"I always go to the movies and this is by far one of the worst. When you look down there is popcorn and other delightful encounters! While I ordered my drink and popcorn I noticed a pile of ice cubes slowly melting RIGHT on the counter in front of me! If they weren't apart of Regal Theaters, I think they'd be out of business honestly. The only good thing about this specific theater is that the chairs are pretty comfortable, but in all.. that's it. \n\nIf you ever make the choice between Regal at StoneCrest or at another establishment, pick the other place.\n\nOh and don't get me started on the price!! $31 for 3 people! Adults!",1
"this is not the place to go for fabulous mexican food. it's not bad, but it's like going to applebee's and expecting a great steak.\n\ni really only like their happy hour cause it comes with free food. mini chimis, chips and salsa and taquitos and such are free if you sit in the bar. i haven't been in awhile, and all locations are different, but from i remember, margaritas weren't a HH special, which is pretty much blashpemy. for friday HH there is usually a DJ. \n\nthis particular location has been going through some heavy renovations, as there will be a light rail stop literally on their patio doorstep (p.s. the otuside area is HUGE), so imagine in the next few years this plca will have a fairly large crowd for HH all week long.",1
"For $2 a ride, it's a cheap way to see the Strip and the people on it are a mixed crowd.  There was a combination of couples, families, and flat out drunk crazy people.  I really feel sorry for the bus drivers that have to deal with these weird people.  It took about 45 minutes from the front of Paris to  Fremont Street.  The ride is really slow because there are so many stops and traffic get so slow on the Strip.  If you're not in a rush, the Deuce is the way to go.",2
This place is a real dump. Glad I changed to the other Travelodge close to MGM rather than this one. The staff was friendly but the hotel is in dire need of an update or maybe a fire.  There are many better bu diet hotels for less money in town.,0
I hate two lane drive thru. Unfortunately I live in the area.  Three times now they go out of order and I get stuck waiting for someone to acknowledge my lane.  Once they took two orders at the other lane while I sat waiting.  Poor procedure inside.  Each time no apologies and no offer to compensate even when I asked today. Go elsewhere like In N Out across the street.,0
"I have never experienced such rude mean service from the security staff.\nI was there for a bachelorette party this past weekend and holy sht it was beyond packed I'm surprised that the fire department didn't shut this place down.\nThankfully we had reserved a table and purchased bottle service everything about the bottle service was fine up until all decided to go downstairs and dance, did I mention how crowded it was.  As we were walking downstairs I was pushed into one of guard the  A$$wipe takes me by the arm and slams me against the wall and starts pulling me thru this maze of a back room. After witnessing how they beat up on some guys I was horrified that they would do the same with me, eventually they asked the meat head that took me back there what i had done and the he said I had given him lip and pushed him, really??? it was an accident I didn't push you I said, after apologizing for something that I didn't do they let me return to the party. I got my stuff and LEFT I was not going to spend any more time there. \nThe next day I woke up with bruises on my arms and on my legs. I would not recommend this place to anyone it's not worth it this place is way too crowded. I was told that they also took the person who was walking behind me and that they punched him twice. \nThe only reason why I didn't call the cops was because I didn't want to be the one to ruin the party.",0
"I will be the first to admit, I do not like the sweet sauce they put on their spaghetti.  That said, I hoped one of the other options would be edible.  It wasn't.  The Chicken Joy so many people rave about practically flooded my kitchen with grease when I bit into it.  The meat itself was poor quality and stringy.  They provided a very small bit of gravy for the chicken.  The gravy tasted like it was made with dirt.   The Hamburgers were overcooked but other than that they were typical fast food burgers.\n\nThe staff is very rude at this location and get impatient if you do not know your order when you walk up or if you ask any questions.\n\nThe restaurant itself always seems dirty, more than once we have had to switch tables because their was some sort of goo or food leftovers on them.\n\nI tried to find some Joy in ChickenJoy but alas, my second trip was as bad as the first.",1
"My wife and I were really looking forward to trying out this restaurant and yesterday we were severely disappointed.\n\nWe came Friday around 130PM for lunch.  Got seated no problem, great.  Staff were very courteous and that was in line with a 5 star hotel.\n\nThe wait was terrible.  They were not understaffed as there were always servers available, but our server came around about once every fifteen minutes.  From the time we sat down to our first bite took about 30 minutes.\n\nThe food was average and overpriced for what we received.  It tasted fine but not much better than our usual nice restaurants, but at 50% the price premium.  The juice my wife ordered was the deal breaker.  9 dollars for a glass of watered down orange juice, and it was super sour (you'd think a 5 star hotel's restaurant would pick out nicer oranges.)\n\nAll in all, maybe the Sunday brunch would have been better.  But I would not visit again based on the service and value at this restaurant.",1
I have been to this Best Buy numerous times. It's conveniently located however this Best Buy has the absolute worst customer service I have ever witnessed.On two separate occasions a worker has failed to answer my questions when I have been willing and able to wait to buy a product. I have also tried to call the store to check on a vacuum and I can't even get through past the automated phone service. This just turns me off to Best Buy completely.,0
"After noticing the $6.89, 16inch garden thin crust pizza we got it, but it was cold and not near the $6.89 price on the menu. Total waste and lies! After telling the waitress our service got real bad. You can't charge different prices. Looks like a consumer protection issue here!",0
"I went there about 2 years ago so I hope things have changed. I was looking for a simple (but well-done) cut that wasn't too expensive. After looking all over the internet, I decided I would give Tonic a try and ask for Emilie to cut my hair. \nWell, I got the simplest cut ever (which I could have replicated in my bathroom)! It didn't suit me (I was hoping Emilie in all her knowledge would provide more input besides selling the products) and cost me 70$ NOT including tip!\n\nThis was the very last time I set foot in a hair salon and I have been happily cutting, styling and dying my hair myself ever since to great results. The highlight of my experience was the delightful Romanian student who washed my hair (with extra neck and scalp massage Mmmmm!). I hope she's still around!",1
"My husband and I went to Spa Mio today to use gift certificates we received for Valentines Day.  We also received some great coupons in the mail, so it seemed like the perfect time to go.\n  My first impression when led into the spa area was that it was beautiful.  Very relaxing, comfortable atmosphere with plasma tv's showing peaceful images, great variety of magazines and a bowl of fresh fruit.  They also had a tray sitting out with cucumber water, as well as fruit drinks.  So far, I was impressed.\n  Then it was time for my 80min massage.  My therapist was very nice, but it just wasn't a great massage.  I was so disappointed because when I scheduled the appt., I asked the receptionist to please give me someone good as I get many massages and am a bit picky when it comes to them.  I asked the therapist to increase the pressure and she said \""sure\"" but then proceeded to dig her elbow into me. I hate it when they do that, that is not what I mean by deeper.  After the disappointing massage, I was on to my pedicure.  The pedicure was fine, but honestly not any better than my usual pedicure I get at the nail salon down the street from my house for half the price.  Also, when I booked the pedi, I asked the receptionist how long the treatment would last and she said it would be an hour.  It was just barely 45mins.\n  The attendants in the spa were extremely nice and helpful, however, at one point they were talking very loudly complaining about other co-workers.  Not exactly what you want to hear when trying to relax.  Also, they were using the co-workers names and I couldn't help but think how they would feel if I walked up and said \""hey, that's my sister/friend, etc you are talking about\"" lol.\n  When I met up with my husband, he was not very impressed with his overall experience either.  We both decided we would tip 15% to our therapists.  We always tip 20%, but didn't feel it was warranted today.  Well, when we checked out, they informed us that a 20% tip is automatically included, unless we wanted to rectify the amount.  We felt very stupid and put on the spot, so just said that was fine, but it was annoying.\n  I don't think we will be returning anytime soon.",1
"This was my first time buying a car (that I would have to make monthly payments on) and I was searching the valley for the perfect one. Going to Honda, Toyota, Jeep and many more locations and dealerships I also went to this location to check out a very specific model of Volkswagen. I was greeted warmly in the parking lot and immediately told the sales associate what I was looking for (pre-owned and a few years old). After showing me one car on the lot that was a brand spanking new 2014 beauty I informed the associate that although the car is wonderful and I am not buying a new car. I asked him if he could check out the inventory for me and he happily walked me inside and sat me down at his desk. After a very long process of giving him my information (he typed with two fingers and seemed as though he had never used a computer before) we got NOWHERE in even looking at inventory. I was handed off to 3 other sales associates up to the floor manager all trying to sell me a 2014 brand new car. I felt like I was speaking a different language and they were so incredibly pushy and disrespectful. I will never recommend this place to anyone. Horrible sales attitudes and after traveling to numerous lots all over the valley this place really upset me. I was called a few weeks after to \""have me come down and check out their new inventory\"" and after telling Tommy I already purchased a vehicle, he literally repeated what he had just told me \""come down and check out our inventory\"" I was so infuriated they were STILL pushing me. \n\nOh yeah and I ended up buying a pre-owned Volkswagen Tiguan that I absolutely love from Lunde Peoria Volkswagen who has the most lovely staff and treated me with respect and helped me find my perfect car.",0
"I ordered from here a few days ago and because of that experience, I will NEVER order from Papa John's again. I ordered from my phone (like I always do) and paid with my credit card (like I always do-which they charged immediately) and had my bf go pick up the pizza on his way to my place (like he always does). They would not give him the pizza because apparently they have a new policy that the person paying has to be present. Ok, I get it, you guys implement a new policy. Business's are completely allowed to do things like that. No problem. However, it would be nice for the customer that when they are placing the order, there is some kind of notice that states this policy so I could have made my decision based on that.\n\nSo I called and spoke to a girl there (Jennifer or Jessica?). She was rude from the moment she started talking. Telling me how that's just their policy and there's nothing that can be done about it. I then told her that I think that is wrong of them since it never said anything about needing to be present online when I placed the order. She then proceeded to ARGUE with me saying that it does say it on there as well as in the confirmation email. I told them to refund my card since they refused to release my order, which they did. I then went back to the email (and read EVERY LAST WORD. It NEVER mentioned this policy. I also went back to the mobile order screen and it also DOES NOT STATE THE POLICY! So there was no way to know of this policy before ordering. \n\nI immediately wrote to customer service and told them of my experience and even offered to send proof that the policy was not stated anywhere! I received the automatic reply that my email was received but have yet to have any real response. I wouldn't be surprised if they sent my complaint to the store directly so of course they won't respond. What a joke!",0
"I am not experienced with BBQ so take that into account when you read this review.  I came here yesterday for take out.  I got two dinner combos--a Georgia chopped pork with the sides of Wilbur beans and garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  The other combo was a Texas beef brisket with sides of potato salad and Dave's cheesy mac and cheese.  Both came with a corn  bread muffin.\n\nWe enjoyed the dinner, perhaps because it was a different kind of meal for us.  It was quick.  I didn't call the order in but went there and ordered at their To Go section.  The wait was about 5 minutes.  Customer service was very good and I was soon on my way.\n\nThe only thing I regret is all the plastic used for take out.  Some recyclable, some not.  I think another time, I'd just go and eat there rather than bring home so much that will end in the landfill.\n\nI'll be back but I need to try some of the other BBQ places in town including one recommended highly by Nelson Q.  He never steers me wrong.",2
Very very bad. Got in at fri 4am the needed a room for a few hours of sleep. Arrived charged full rack rate instead of quoted players rate that i normally get. I have stayed here numerous times and have spent tens of thousands in casino. Well not this time. Paid for room went up to floor and none of my keys work i had exchanged keys 3 times and none worked. Went down a forth time and was givin a different room along with keys. Guess what no workie had exchanged keys another 3 times and finally got in. After screwing around tired and cranky i asked what can be done to adjust room price. The woman behind the counter gives me a coupon book and smiles. Wow. I was a repeat customer but will no longer be coming back. The room was dirty i just gave up. Word of advice stay away. Even the casino restrooms had pee all over the floor...save yourself the hassle.,0
"Good God, this place is a mess.\r\n\r\nFor those of you familiar with the Cosi chain, you probably are aware that their product and service has been gradually declining for years. \r\n\r\nThe new Madison store is no exception.\r\n\r\nLets recap my last 5 trips:\r\n1. Hooray!  Breakfast sandwich has all the ingredients!! Wow!\r\n2. Breakfast sandwich missing the ham I had ordered\r\n3. Breakfast sandwich missing the red peppers I had ordered\r\n4. Hooray!  Breakfast sandwich has all the ingredients!! Wow!\r\n5. Breakfast sandwich missing the cheese.  (And yes, I had ordered it with cheese.)\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the coup de grace... (meaning this is the death blow to me ever going there again.)\r\n\r\nMy friend Mark gets a breakfast sandwich on his way to work.  He shows up at work all happy and ready to eat, only to find that his sandwich is missing....\r\n\r\nThe EGG!!!\r\n\r\nI mean seriously, how do you miss the EGG of an \""Omelet\"" sandwich?!?!\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem is everyone there is sleeping in the morning and they don't really get going until lunch and dinner?  Should I be skipping breakfast and walking over to Jo's (which, by the way has a much, much better breakfast sandwich?)\r\n\r\nLook, I don't really expect Cosi to taste great.  I don't expect much at ALL from Cosi.  But really, I DO expect them to make what I order.  Their food is OK, at best, and I'm OK with that.  I'll go to Soleil if I want flavorful food.  Cosi is simply convenient.\r\n\r\nIf you're a gambler, go to Cosi.  You MIGHT get what you order, you might not.  What you won't get is good food.",0
"We were enticed with the fried fish and fried chicken for 4th of July dinner. What a joke...I may as well visited my friend at the nursing home and had dinner with him. Bland, obviously all pre-frozen and purchased by the 5 gallon bucket. Never going back...only saving grace was the server...delightful.",0
"What a horrible place!  I order a stew...little did I know it was going to be one of the most salty, tasteless meals I've ever eaten.  There was suppose to be Cilantro in the stew...there wasn't.  I ask for some and the waiter brings my parsley! He tells me they don't have cilantro, yet the menu clearly said there was cilantro. The owner sometime later came by to ask me about the meal, I told how bad it was...he said thanks and turned around.  My sister ordered a beef Kabob...menu price was $17.  The waiter asked if she wanted this or that. We get the bill, and her meal costs $25!!!  She thought the meal tasted good, but said she'd never go back again. We got the bill for $60!!!  With all their nickel and dime items.  I would never suggest this place to a soul...and the restaurant is empty...and there is a reason!",0
"Make sure to get the Red Won Tons.  Food here is pretty good overall.  There is always a long line which is a good sign.  It's not that bad of a wait, so stick it out.  Stir-Fried Chinese Greens of the Day is excellent and I always get the Dan Dan Noodles.  Extra spicy.... Every time I'm in Vegas, we always go here at least once.....",2
"After everyone raving about this place and Martha Stewart eating here we knew we had to go. We gave it three different tries. We are done. I fail to understand the appeal of this restaurant or how they stay in business. The food is decent, but don't be hungry or have any place to be as you'll be waiting. And waiting. That's after you've waited and waited for one of the empty tables. Then there is the completely incompetent, rude and totally unprofessional staff to round out your miserable dinner.",0
"The food was GREAT.  Since we were there for restaurant week, we were able to enjoy a sampling of their items and loved everything (ceviche, nachos, mahi mahi tacos).  The service was okay.  The food was so good that I really want to give it more stars.  I never thought decor and energy of a place would be such a turn off but sadly, it was for me and Distrito.\n\nMy main issue with Distrito is that the decor is too colorful and busy.  It also seemed too casual (i.e. outdoor seating of picnic tables) given the menu seemed a bit more upscale.  We were seated at a small table inside that had a bright pink glittery top. Alone it would have been super cool but it was too much to take in with the multi-colored and differently designed walls and tables around us.  We asked to move to a table with a normal top which was a table too large for just 2 people.  A couple of the walls and the bungee cord divider reminded us of Easter Basket designs which was strange.  Overall, the place is a bit of an eye sore.  \n\nThe energy level in the place was very low but it was a Monday night and the bartender said it's much livelier Thursday-Saturday.",2
"Sometimes you want a quick lunch that doesn't cost $15+.. sometimes you want some reliable food with the quality level of say Mcdonalds or a Subway.. this place is NONE of these things. It's slow, it's expensive, and the quality sucks. F you Caesar's for not putting a food court in the mall either.. seriously.. they screw you into eating their over priced crap. \n\nPay a few bucks more (at least at lunch time) and eat at Mesa.. it's worth the splurge and you won't walk away feeling jipped.",0
"Outside in front of the business you have two employees smoking cigarettes. Nice.... First thing I want to do when I walk into a restaurant is smell cigarette smoke. Why don't these employees smoke in the back of the restaurant? Blatantly not  giving a sh*t.  Once you walked in, you see a sign that says \""Please wait here to be seated\"". I stood there and right in front of me I see the Men's bathroom door and a folding table filled with napkins, silverware, and menus. Its pretty rare to see a server station look like that all out in the open.  The place was half full at 2pm. Servers were walking around but no host to welcome new customers. I stood there for about 5 minutes without getting greeted by anyone. The food isn't worth the terrible service. Never coming back.",0
"I'm kind of befuddled as to how this place averages 4 stars.   A good museum is one that wants you coming back for multiple visits.  \n\nAfter two hours, we were done.  Our kids are super-curious and loved places like the Children's Museum right down the road.  There, we would visit a dozen times per year.  \n\nI think that this museum just feels tired and limited.  Even with all of the floors, there's just not a lot of sizzle to the exhibits.  \n\nA major metro like Phoenix should have a bigger, badder museum.  I guess this just goes to show why this State is ranked in the bottom 5 nationally in all things related to the education of children.  Too bad.",1
"We had the Orange Cafe Benny and Veracruz Omelet... Not impressed.\nThe coffee was horrible, either burnt or overly bitter, our waiter was mute or shy, barely spoke a word. \nAs for the dishes the \""Benny\"" was an odd mix of Boiled and Creamed egg mixed with too much onion and a bit of mushroom and bacon with sauce on top of bread... All I could taste was the onion and boiled egg. \nThe omelet was better, but the odd addition of celery to a otherwise decent salsa was confusing, ultimately overpowering the taste. \nThe save face on these plates was the potatoes, which were nicely cooked and spiced. \nFruit was mostly unexistent, just a slice of orange and melon was included. \nThe odd combinations failed to impress, and for $34 with tip for two, I don't think we'll be going back.",1
"Awful. Awful. Awful. Worst service I have ever had, bad food, cold food, overpriced. \n\nWhere do I start? We waited 20-25 minutes to get in for breakfast. It was the WORST service and food I have had in a long  time, and EXTREMELY overpriced (particularly considering the awful food and awful service).  My husband and I got mimosas (why not? we are on vacation) and they were $9 each.  We expected a large wine glass for our $9.  Instead, we received the smallest, tiniest champagne glass I have ever see.  It was a shot of champagne for $9. No thanks. I'll pass.  \n\nThen my husband and I got the eggs Benedict to eat.  He got the traditional and I got their special one.  All of the eggs were overcooked, 2 didn't even run out when you broke them open.  They were basically hard boiled eggs.  The sauce over them was tasteless and cold.  Everything, in fact, was cold and unseasoned.  It was awful.  \n\nThe service through the entire meal was awful but when we tried to pay the bill, we were ignored for at least 20 minutes.   We almost walked out and I have never walked out on a check.  When I finally got up to complain and get someone to take our credit card, the manager brought the check but did not ask how the food was or if everything was ok.  Even the management didn't care.  This is cafeteria food for $20+ per plate. There are farrrrr better places in Vegas and even in the paris to eat, for much much more reasonable of a price.",0
"What the HECK!!!\nwe heard so many things...4 stars on yelp, one of the top 3 vegas buffets behind wicked spoon and bacchanal, blah, blah, blah.\nwe were sooo excited...out first ladies weekend away from the kids and hubbies and we had to hit at least one vegas buffet to say we truly did vegas.  the other 2 buffets were hovering close to $50 for dinner so we decided on studio B since it was $39.99 for a seafood friday dinner buffet.  \nwe jumped in our mini van and left the strip to head to henderson and at 6:00 we had to wait in a 45 minute line.  our fault completely for not peeking our head into the food but we drove all the way there in our minivan and we just had to believe yelp so we figured it was worth the wait.\nall i had to do was make one quick trip around the buffet and i knew it was a DUD!!!  i love to eat and so unfortunately had my share of buffets...let's just say buffets are not my fave...pure gluttony.  but i figured if we are going to do it...let's do it right!!!\ni think this place is nothing more than a tiny weeny step above home town buffet (i think that's what it's called...right?)  sure there is a huge selection but i would definitely choose quality versus quantity.  wilted salads, frozen fried fish, boxed mash potatoes, dried up small tiny crab legs, cheeeaaaaap wine from a box, even their lattes which i was sooo excited about was the type you pushed a button for and sooo darn sweet!!!\nARRGGGHHHH!!!\nso disappointed...not only by the food but also the HYPE!!!\nstill had a blast in vegas BABY!!!",1
"The food and drinks were good, but the service was beyond awful. Unfriendly waitresses were the norm. Plopping the menu's down on our table and leaving without a simple greeting or eye contact? I have never experienced that before and it was odd to view up close and personal. Will never recommend this place due to the wait staff and I am one that rarely complains or cringes when other people do at my table.",1
"I have minimal expectations for this chain and they have been met. I have had to return to the restaurant many times after leaving the drive through to get my order fixed.  That would have to be my biggest complaint. On a positive note, the inside and outside of the building  is normally clean and tidy. They have always gotten my food out fast, which normally would be a plus if I didn't have to go back to get the order fixed. This location has a prime location due to the fact they have no competing venues with in miles of them.",2
"Our reservation was set for 7:30pm on a Saturday, we arrived to a nearly empty establishment with outdated d\u00e9cor and senior citizen to match. That should've been red flag number one. We waited at the entrance for a few moments before we were greeted by whom I guess was the owner. He said he had been expecting us, sat us at our table and disappeared for the remainder of the evening.  Our waiter was odd; he seemed to be in a rush and irritated even though the place was empty. For starters we ordered the pasta trio sampler and the Oyster Rockefeller.  The only thing memorable about the sampler was the gnocchi which was as good as most yelpers mentioned. The Rockefeller may have been the worse I've ever had; the oysters were so tiny I could barely discern them in the heavily creamed spinach. I'm not sure how something so creamy can be so utterly bland and flat. For the entr\u00e9e I had the Salmon which again was drowned in a weird sauce that covered the entire plate. The salmon was moist but the sauce was putrid. It tasted at least 3 days old. The sides were cold oven roasted potatoes which again were covered in that odd sauce. For the finale, I tried the Cr\u00e8me Brulee, again that was a mistake. It was ice cold and had chunks of pineapples in it which is not normal nor was it ever mentioned. The top of the brulee was not properly browned and didn't crack when my spoon hit it. I look forward to cracking my Cr\u00e8me Brulee, darn! Needless to say I will never be back here again.",0
"I'm weird.  I believe in smiling at people and saying please and thank you.  And in saying, \""Can I help you?\""  \""How are you doing today?\""  You'll get none of that nonsense at this Fry's.\n\nI know a guy who is friends with a department manager for Fry's.  He said they had a \""customer service\"" push one time, telling their employees to ask customers if they were finding everything they need, and to tell them thank you.\n\nAFTER THEY HAND OVER THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY AND KEEP YOU EMPLOYED!\n\nUgh.  It is sad you have to tell people to do this.  This just reinforces I live in a Bermuda Triangle of bad customer service.\n\nThis morning I got cut off on my quest for yogurt by an employee checking her phone.  She was smiling, but it wasn't at me.  I have a feeling it was at the naughty message on her phone.  That is great use of company time.\n\nThen I stood patiently at the Tully's counter while two geriatrics gave me the X-ray, how-you-doin little lady look.  No employee in sight.  I even wandered around looking for one.\n\nSo I had to risk my life in the Cobblestone parking lot to get some caffeine at Dunkin' Donuts.  God I hate that parking lot.\n\nAnd so, I'm done done doneski with Fry's and continue on my quest for good customer service in the Alma School/Queen Creek corridor.",1
"Red Square was one of my favorites. Wonderful food, top notch service and the best vodka drinks around. I was excited to have my kids with me in Vegas and wanted to treat them at one of my favorite restaurants. I raved all about it. \n\nWe were told the restaurant had been sold and there were many changes. None of which seemed to be for the better. The signature beef stroganoff was horrible. I was told the old owner/management would not disclose the recipe so that was the best they could do. The appetizer skewers were burnt and you couldn't even tell what kind of meat you were eating. The steaks were just steaks. Nothing to write home about. My son had the shrimp, which he said were tasty. There was just no atmosphere. No dining experience like before. It was just a restaurant. The service was so lacking. Our waitress didn't know what she was doing and we were completely ignored. Almost three hours in that place. We were told there was a new system in place and everyone was trying to get use to it. What??!!! Why do I care about a new system!  We paid well over two bills to be subjected to poor training and mismanagement. Oh and one more thing, this restaurant isn't a 21 and over establishment. So please hostesses, pull you dresses down just a tad. I don't like having to see the crotch of your underwear, if you're wearing any, as you strut around half dressed. I'm not a prude, granted it is Vegas, but not whilst I'm eating and certainly not in front of my two teenage children. A little class ladies. \n\nSadly, Red Square and my memories of the intermezzo's, wonderful beef broth soup with pillows of goodness and the creamy, melt in your mouth stroganoff and wait staff that was the best around is a thing of the past. Crossing off Red Square and added the Burger Bar. \n\nWho said change was a good thing?",1
"Went to Proper for pizza and beers around 5, and they were already pretty packed. We split a pizza and salad, both of which we're tasty, despite downtown level prices and portions. The crust has a great doughy chew despite being thin/brick oven, and I was a big fan of the carnivore toppings. \n\nHave to dock one star for service and one for beer price/selection. They only had two bartenders handling a large bar (beer/wine/cocktails) plus getting orders for the wait staff. Our bartender was friendly and efficient, but we waited over ten minutes each time we finished a round, and had to skip our last beer to get the check and run to a ballgame. He was absolutely swamped. \n\nBeer list was long but unimpressive. Focusing on regional beers is great, but four Yards taps is four too many, especially at $6/7 a pour. I'll pay $7 for something brought in from the West Coast etc, but not for middle of the road regional beers. Worth a second visit for a downtown pizza craving, especially if they add happy hour pricing.",2
"It's very unfortunate that I have to give this place 2 stars. They say first impressions are the most important. Well, my first impression of Le Chalet wasn't a very good one. We had reservations at 8 on valentines day. We weren't seated until 8:30 which I understand because people especially want to enjoy dinner tonight but the hostess didn't know anything. If we didn't say anything, we would've been waiting longer. \n\nThey had a special performance for Valentines day which we opted to see for an additional fee per person. It was a nice show but service seemed to be halted due to it. 80% of the people there already had their meals. It took us 2 hours to have an appetizer (the crepe with scallops), cheese fondue which had an unbelievable amount of butter in and a dessert crepe which was delicious. We originally ordered the \""La Potence\"" but since it took over 45 minutes, we cancelled it. Turns out it was the right choice since the kitchen didn't even prepare it yet. \n\nCan't say I'd ever come back by choice as it seems they need practice for serving a full restaurant. Turns out my scallops weren't prepared properly as I suffered from food poisoning later in the evening. Quite an impression that will last for some time.",1
"Oh Tea Station, where shall I begin? You and I were pretty good friends when we started to get to know each other, but then like an abusive ex gf, you started showing your bad points really quickly. I have been going to this place for months but after sampling other boba tea places around the area, I now know there are better places where customers are actually treated with respect. Why do I have to bring up respect when talking about a cafe? Because it has all to do with service. Or lack thereof in this case. \n\nThere are two wait staff members here, a boy and a girl, who always seem to be giving not only me but other customers a hard time when ordering drinks. I even experimented different ways to order drinks (Pointing to the drinks on the drink counter, speaking slowly and enunciating each word, learning Taiwanese (Okay, maybe not the last one but I might as well have)) to lower the aggravation or pissy meter off of these wait staff members. Nothing works. They will often get annoyed or angry that you can't get your order right the first time. I have worked front of the house in cafes before larger than this establishment and I have not once showed signs the level of discontent or disrespect these guys show. It's gotten from me being embarrassed thinking I made a mistake to being embarrassed that they don't know how to do customer service. Probably the only constructive criticism I can say is to retrain these two wait members or get a touch screen so you can punch in your own orders to save time, money, and customers. \n\nBut enough of the bad, the good is that their drinks are consistently good and there are some very good helpful members of their team like the older pudgy guy who usually mixes the drinks or the young short girl who always seem happy to have a job.\n\nI would give this place one star if it wasn't for the consistency of their food and drinks. Remember, people will go out to eat at places with good food and drink but they will only comeback if there is good service to match.\n\nMy advice? Why take the abuse? Try Volcano Tea House or Fresh Cup down the street. At least they won't chastise you for messing up your order or nag you on it.",1
Even though calendar show classes available they really aren't available.  Planned and outing based on the calendar and got an email 2 days before the event that the only opening would be at least 3 weeks away.   When I finally got ahold of someone that works there she said it is not her job to keep up the calendar because she is busy with other things.  Very disappointed with the customer service or lack of.  Will take my business somewhere else.,0
"i work really close to this place, so it's ultra convenient. but i reserve it in case of emergency only. \n\nthe veggie sandwich i first receive was the topping for a burger: lettuce, tomato and onion on bread. that was it. i realized this before paying and asked for some extra veggies, a slice of cheese and some mustard. talk about not delish. but it filled the hole.\n\nthey also just started this second counter inside the deli called the inner grill. grilled sandwiches, smaller portions and cheaper prices. i got the caprese: mozzerella, pesto and tomato on baguette, grilled. usually simple and good. this time? not so much. meh.",1
"I've came here several times and EVERY TIME its not dusted, washed and vacuumed all the way! and their slow. \nSeriously, its waste of your money. I get so annoyed when they come by where I work to sell coupons. I tell them their services are not worth my money.",0
"My friends and I went here for after hours and it was so-so. The lounge itself is nice, but small! Music was louder than any other club I went to while I was in Vegas. There was no cover since it was after hours and I actually got a free drink by talking to the bartender for long enough. Fun spot for late night, and I had heard that Carmen Electra was there earlier that night!",2
I had brunch here and found the food to be pretty average. I am not sure if I was supposed to order a specific breakfast item but I went with the daily special omelet which had filet. It tasted fine but wasn't anything to write home about. The omelet was actually quite bland and lacked seasoning. I also didn't enjoy the beignets as they were way too sweet and weren't moist enough.,2
"Friends took us there last night and all of us left fairly annoyed.  Admittedly it was very crowded but at $75 - $100 (after tax, tip, etc.) a person, they should be able to staff accordingly.  They sat our group of 8 in a back corner.  It looked like some sort of conference room as there was a projection screen above our head.   We sat and ordered drinks fairly quickly and then were directed to the salad bar to get started.  The salad bar was decent, however, the grilled vegetables were either overcooked and mushy or not cooked long enough.   The other items were more than decent...in all fairness.   Now for the meat.   They give you these little table markers which indicate to the servers when you are ready to try the meat selections.   It started off with a vengeance of servers coming to us to offer their wares.  However, after the first wave and only having tried a few items of what the restaurant offers - no one came.  We kept having to ask over and over to send someone with the other items and we kept getting the same meats offered to us.  So needless to say there were huge gaps in between our meal, all of the sides got cold, we had to ask for water a few times, no one came to check our bread...Coffee refill took over 10 minutes.   We were forced to leave a $70 tip due to policy but really we were borderline outraged.  Our poor friends that brought us were so embarrassed and angry.  It was a special occasion.  Living in this area - we have hundreds of fine dining choices.  Next time, we will try one of the others.   By the way, the meats themselves were hit and miss.  Some were over salty, some fatty, some over-charred, some perfect.  Ambiance is very nice though.  $500 tab - not worth it.\n\nC.L.\nGilbert, AZ",1
"Caribbean Fusion is good, but needs a little menu tweaking. \n\nI went there totally expecting beef patties on the menu. After I already ordered my Jerk Pork, I asked if they would eventually serve them. The other server (not my server) said...\""oh, we have them\"". Huh?? Where? They certainly weren't on the menu or mentioned when I ordered. All I really wanted was a couple beef patties, some plantains and genuine ginger beer! I ordered the beef patties (abandoned my jerk pork) and ate the plantains I ordered with my pork dish. The patties were delish and so were the plantains. The jerk pork was flavorful but a little on the tough side. \n\nSimply put, the menu was great with the Jamaican dishes. They went awry by adding Italian style pasta dishes and salads with no Jamaican flare, American side dishes....like corn on cob, baked potato and french fries. \n\nThey're not super busy yet, and could probably do better by narrowing the selection to a few stellar and genuine Jamaican dishes. Oh, by the way, the website is www.jamicanfusions.com (Fusion with an \""s\"", unlike the spelling of the restaurant). \n\nOn the lighter side, I know a great Mojito, and theirs are fantastic!!! \n\nBon Appetite!",1
"Not the most Mexican-y of Mexican places I've been to, but passable as Mexican food. I have been here several times and never been blown away. Its been here for as long as I can remember, and is a stable as long as I can remember. Tonight we went for their happy hour and I was surprised to see that they offer a free buffet! Chips, salsa, mini enchiladas, taco meat and beans. Not bad! People were still ordering full meals though, but I was all about the freebies :)",2
"Disappointing, but I have to preface by saying that my taste is spoiled by the diverse Thai restaurants in Southern California (LA and SD), so my standards may not be representative of Scottsdale. \n\nWe ordered: \nBeef Pad See Ewe (missing that \""pan-fried\"" taste, it's soggy and too salty) \nChicken Pad Thai (sauce was not infused into the noodle) \nGreen Curry (okay) \n#29 Pork dish (i think)--too oily \nThai Tea-- Decent \nFried Rice--They ran out of crab so we got the chicken instead--nothing to write home about \n\nNo mango with rice because they were out of season. Sob Sob \n\nWe really had high hopes, but were left high and dry, plus an uneasy feeling of grease in our tummies...Sorry to contradict the high ratings, but if you are a spoiled brat and come from the land of diversity, you too will understand. :)",1
"I expected a lot more from a dish that is the namesake of a restaurant. That's some greasy, flavorless fish, CFT. For shame. While I commend you for giving me a lot of food, it simply was not good.\n\nI also have an issue with the corn salsa that come with the chips at the table. I love corn salsa IN a dish. But, it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips. \n\nThe kernels...they were...everywhere.",1
I'll never go here again. I order the vegetarian sandwich to be delivered. The delivery guy shows up with no change which means I either have to turn away the food of pay $10 for the stupid thing. Then it was missing avocado. I  called to complain and they told me to search for the avocado between the cheese. $10 for a sandwich I need a magnifying glass to see what's on it. F that!,0
"We have tried this place multiple times. Drink prices are high. Last lunch experience they messed up a salad and chic strips. How does that happen? Salad was missing items. Strips were freezer burnt and came out dry and cold. Also had chili which was tasty, but no cheese. No cheese on chili?  C'mon!",1
"Very disappointing.  Big smiles with air brains....the window clerk screwed up an order ahead of us because she failed to read the slip three times in a row. The California Burger was like a cow pie sort of style, with an onion thicker then the meat slab.  The burgers were cold because the tomatoe and onion were so large, over powering the meat slab.  It was like a cold picnic including hard, cold, French fries.  I should have figured when the order was handed to me and the bag was not hot.  I am disappointed to see yet another business that will be short lived.  Sadly, I have already noticed the swing of business slowing :(.",0
"I love this place, Paris (the actual city) is one of my favorites in the world, and this hotel really does a decent job capturing its essence. Aside from the aesthetics this place is a huge pain in the Brie rind! My cell service is horrible, there is a modem in our room but a $15 per day charge for wifi (not to mention is only available on one device even after paying and horrible service), the cable is shabby and lacking of the most popular basic cable channels, and room service is full of fees and bogus charges. We are here on business and supposed to be given Diamond Club access but it will take them 3-4 days to \""process\""??? our info? Am I wrong to see that as completely ridiculous? And I know my cell service isn't the hotels fault but if I was allowed wifi I don't think my cell service would be such an issue. I shouldn't have to be dealing w my cell provider while away on business in Vegas. I feel almost trapped and kept from all basic conveniences in order to be lured downstairs into the casino and do not feel that my needs as a guest away from home have been considered at all. Also as stated, being here on business for a full week I would like to take it easy and relax being able to watch regular cable tv as I would back home after a full day of work. I feel at over $150 a night on the Vegas strip that it isn't far fetched to expect what the local Motel 6 offers and some.",1

"I spent almost an hour and a half waiting for an oil change that I had an appointment for at 10a on a weekday. There only two other people there that I could see and both waited over 2 hours (one was just getting two tires done). \n\nFull disclosure: I was redeeming a Groupon. I understand this is a tricky balance for businesses to make it worth the extra business deal sites bring in, but an extra long wait can be dealt with by having staff that doesn't treat you like you're the one making their life difficult just for taking them up on their offers.\n\nIt's hard to find a good shop, but this isn't it. Keep looking. Running a business is hard, I get it. But at least say sorry when you mess up.",0
"So, after hearing a lot of really good things about Raising Cain's I decided to swing by for lunch today.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.   I'll go through piece by piece.\n\n-The bread was pretty awful.  It was soggy and had a weird flavor to it.  \n-The fries were average at best.  Not terrible but nothing special either.\n-Cain's sauce is BLEH.  I tried their honey mustard as well and it wasn't very good, either.\n-The chicken was the only thing that was actually good.  The breading was very plain but the chicken itself was tasty and, as others have mentioned, actually tastes like real chicken.\n-There was a lot of food for the price, so that was good, too.\n\nOverall it wasn't very good.  I won't be a repeat customer.",1
"Avoid. These guys have yet to get my order right after 3 visits. Nothing exciting either. Hamburger with catsup. Every time there's something wrong. I'll get a burger with everything, burger with mustard, chicken sandwich...  Definition of Durp. Their receipts print the taunting statement of \""Concerns please call\"" and no number.",0
I went there after reading the reviews but the place kind of disappointed me. It was dinner time but the place was empty. Only a waiter for the whole restaurant. Service was slow. We ordered lamb and catch of the day. The fish is almost ok if I didn't taste the gallbladder. And the lamb just sucks for we can taste the meat is not fresh. Will never go there again.,1
It's a good deal. I have stayed there twice. I was disappointed with their pool side service - over memorial weekend they only had two bartenders and lines were extraordinary long to get a drink. Poolside waitresses were very friendly but it appeared that they were getting paid to socialize instead of wait on guests which I found odd. It seemed like the pool scene needed more management on hand to make sure people were indeed getting  the service we were paying for with the resort fee. Needs improvement on it's customer service but nighly rate is indeed a good deal.,1
"Extremely rude girl rang me up for a cup of coffee.  She gave me the coffee and then told me I was 171.  I told her I didn't understand what she was talking about and she acted like I was stupid and slowly said ... It's your number to get your food.  I said \""I didn't order any food ... Just coffee which you already gave me.\""  She just turned her back and walked away without saying anything.  With so many choices at the airport,  I'll go somewhere else next time.",0
"I checked in my 15th floor room, was good with nice view, yesterday. Then this morning, the ants swarmed the room. So they moved me to the suite on the 2nd floor with windows facing the big wall of next building.\n\nAbout WiFi.... There is NONE! Just wired ethernet which is NOT long enough to reach the sofa in the living room. To use the ethernet, you need to stand up and put your laptop next to the TV...\n\nOn my next trip, I will stay at other hotel.",1
"\""Meh\"" is a very good word to describe my experience with Postino East. The wait time we were given was 20 minutes - which turned into 50 minutes. We were given really awkward seating - a couch that was shared with a couple (it could have been detached, I'm not sure why they insisted on pushing everything together). \n\nThere were flies EVERYWHERE. Hang bags of water above doorways - flies won't go under anywhere they can sense water above them. Or let them crawl all over the food, as Postino seems to prefer.\n\nThe food was okay. It was very affordable though. The waitstaff is also very nice and polite, and despite the busyness of the morning, prompt.\n\nI'm not sure why they chose to have way more outdoor seating than indoor seating in a city that's unbearably hot for a good part of the year. Seems like a waste of space to me.\n\nOverall I'd like to visit for dinner or lunch. The food is affordable and well-made, but their handling of crowds can definitely be improved.",2
"Sam Woo is practically a household name in Southern California, much like Panda Express would be in most cities.  There are dozens of them all over Southern California, from Monterey Park to Orange County.  I used to go to the one in Irvine quite often, and loved that they had \""on-demand\"" Peking Duck.  Most Chinese restaurants make you order it 24 hours ahead of time, but here you can get it whenever you want.  Some of the Sam Woo's are BBQ, some are seafood, but all of them serve traditional Hong Kong style Chinese food.  \n\nThe Sam Woo in Las Vegas is a BBQ restaurant, which means they have the Peking Duck on-demand.  This is my favorite part about this Sam Woo. They also have a lot of other BBQ items, such as BBQ spare rib and Chickens.  These can be either bought at the sit-down restaurant, or at the counter at the front of the restaurant.  \n\nThe restaurant is always pretty busy, but they handle the crowd well, and always have room for new tables.  I really enjoy their Hong Kong style crispy noodles, and their Honey Walnut Shrimp.  I also like the Pork Chop with Salt & Pepper.  \n\nThe reason I give Sam Woo's in Las Vegas a 3-star review is because it does not live up to the hype of the southern California restaurants.  I have found that the one out here in Las Vegas is hit or miss, having had very mediocre food on several occasions, while also having the typical great Sam Woo cuisine on severl other occasions.  This is what left me at 3 stars.  If they were consistent, it would be a 4-5 star, but until I consistently get the Sam Woo quality, they will never earn the other stars.  \n\nThis being said, I would suggest Sam Woo for anyone looking for great Peking Duck or Chinese BBQ.  There are not many other places in town that do it as well as them.",2
"I met a good sized group of people in the evening due to the food and drink specials available during the summer. Dollar tacos and two dollar drafts including imports. Whoa!  Great deal and the food wasn't half bad. \n\nSo why two stars?  They were understaffed that day. That is something that I understand and can roll with. Not a problem.  It took 10-15 minutes before the server noticed my gesturing. Eventually I placed a dinner order.  I had ordered a beer and 15 minutes later I made mention of it to the server. I just thought she forgot. Her response was completely uncalled for. Harsh tone, reactionary word choice, scowl...  I asked the table if I came off rude or something. No, I was apparently quite nice. Not only did I feel like walking out, everyone at the table was looking around wondering what the heck just happened. Someone a few people down said \""oh, yeah. That's why we never come here.\""  \n\nWe were a polite, hungry, and thirsty group with ages ranging between 20-60.  The staff made us feel like an intrusion as my simple question wasn't the only time we were snapped at and dumbfounded by our treatment. \n\nThe tip was added into the bill. I still gave her a dollar on top of the included gratuity.  She ended up with a 30% tip from me. That is likely the only time I step foot in that place. I was treated like an inconvenience. Trash.  I would have ordered a few more beers. I stopped at one because of the ridiculousness. \n\nFood, drink, and price was great. The staff is the worst. \n\nThe.  Worst.",1
"The spread is impressive, and most of the dishes were executed well and solid, but it didn't quite have the wow factor. Nothing quite had the creative spazazz. They have a bunch of different salads, most of which are of the creamy dressing variety. The kale salad could have benefited from massaging the kale a bit more so that the kale is less fibrous. The cheeses were good. I also thought that the mussels and bone marrow was good. However, some of the bone marrow pieces were inedible. They were hard, just like bone. Perhaps they hadn't been cooked down enough? They have a large meat counter - prime rib, bone marrow, sausage, as well as an Asian inspired section. The desserts spread is also impressive. I really liked their pistachio gelato, but wasn't as impressed by the salty peanut one - that one tasted like peanut butter, which I love, but a little bit less in gelato form. \nOver all, it's an experience, but maybe not mind-blowing?",2
"Food: 2.5/5\n\nService: 0/5\n\n\nIt was the first time for Korean BBQ for a couple of my friends, and our server at first seemed a little odd. She would only take our drink order even if we already knew what we wanted to eat.\n\nSure, I guess you can't remember or write it down.  -1\n\nReceived our condiments and little plates, kim-chi was okay, I've had worst.\n\nWhen one of the plates we received at the table had a FEW strands of hair,\nwe immediately told our busser and he replied \""Let me see,\"" wanting us to prove it. -2\nWould you really take the time to stop eating and get a new plate if it really wasn't there?\n\nWe got that plate to-go, hoping it'll be a new one.\n\nWe received the bill with that plate still on the order, and they swiped my card.\nAlthough, I should've told them to take it off prior, I still took the chance to tell our server, who had not known of the incident (or acted like it), and they took it off.\n\nWe felt like they were accusing us saying, \""None of us have red hair.\""\nThe cook even came out with actions of pulling and examining her hair. Why aren't you wearing a hairnet? \n\nThey refunded the original amount back to the card, as they stated \""it'll be back within 24 hours\"" (I highly doubted that) and charged me again for the new amount. So I'm out almost double of what we were supposed to pay.\n\nThey should have just refunded me back the cost of the plate.\n\nI'm really unsatisfied with this restaurant, but I still paid gratuity.\n\nEDIT: It's been a few days and I still haven't received my refund.",0
"Service I received was even worse, although I think it all depends on which server you get. My waitress was very much lost. First she took my order. She came back to repeat my food order. She returned later to ask what drink I ordered. After a minute she asked again what food I ordered.  Kicker is, food was barely a notch above Taco Bell, only way overpriced.",0
"-Revisted this store.\n\n-Employee magically appeared from the back and just stood at the register. She said nothing at all, it very ackward and uncomfortable, so I left. \n\n-During my previous visits, the owner was working at the time and made you feel welcomed, even when she was busy or sitting there.\n\n-A decent selection of scrapbook stuff, not a huge amount.\n\n-A wall of stamping supplies, diverse selection.\n\n-Paint your own ceramics selection - looks fun!\n\n-I wanted to like this place, but it's just ok.",1
"This has to be one of the largest malls in Arizona.  It's massive.  I went here to shop for vitamins at Vitamin World and had to try and find it.  Luckily, I called ahead and the guy from Vitamin World gave me directions on where to park, by the theater....otherwise, I wouldn't have found it.\n\nWhen I walked in, I was surprised to find amusement park type attractions inside....big bouncy things full of kids, and other stuff.  This place was packed.\n\nWill have to come back when I have more time to wander around and check out other stores.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%",2
"Okay, I've been to a lot of gluten free bakeries  since I have Celiac's and I really, really want to like this one because the selection is amazing. I mean, pasta, a million types of bread and pastries... but, I just can't like this one.\n\nI've had several different varieties of things, egg-free, casein free, just the gluten free stuff, but they all lacked moisture. And that's the thing I find in this bakery, is that the items all consistently lack moisture. And yes that's hard to do with GF baking but it can be done.  I haven't found a product I truly enjoy, everything sort of tastes like a chalky, crumbly version of a Pillsbury product. The bread is also dense (I've had gluten-free bread that isn't) and costs way too much - its almost cheaper to buy the frozen GF bread from the grocery store.\n\nThe other thing that worries me is there is a regular bakery next door, and while I assume that they do not share a ventilation system I do worry about contamination. (Flour can stay suspended in the air for 3 - 10 days) and if you are sensitive to gluten that can be worrisome.\n\nThe staff is friendly though, and the place is warm and cozy - I just wish the food tasted like it.",1
"I went into this dealership looking for a new car as I had recently totaled my vehicle. Because the auto loan for my totaled vehicle still appeared on my credit (I had only had the accident a week or so earlier) even though the loan was in good standing the salesman said I did not qualify for a loan with them .... to make a long story short I found an 09 Cube (Krom trim level) with 5k miles on it and every thing I wanted for 14k ... that's $3,000 less than ANY of the cubes on Riverviews lot and in addition the dealership I did buy my car from didn't even flinch over the other loan being on my credit. \n\nI have been using the service department at Riverview because it's close to my office. The first time I took it in I had a coupon they had emailed to me for $25 for an oil change, tire rotation, and something else. When I checked out the paperwork didn't reflect the tire rotation had been done so I called the gentleman that had been helping me to get clarification on the matter and he never called me back : / \n\nI do continue to get my car serviced there and I haven't had any real problems with them. My car is actually going in for it's 18,750 mile service and a windshield replacement on Thursday so I'll be sure to update on how well or not that goes.",1
"Not too many Hot Dog joints around so it's easy to say it's one of the better ones.\nJust a little pricey (for a hot dog)... but it's a CASH ONLY place!!! What the crap is up with that? Ted, you gotta fix that. I don't even carry cash anymore.\nThat said, the rings and fries a better than average. They'll fix you a good shake.\nAnd they fire roast it up right in front of your eyes.\nI would give it 4 start on taste alone, but the cash only and usually long lines bring it back just a little bit.",2
"3 stars. Not because their food isn't yummy (It IS!) but it is an incredibly small place and on more than one occasion, we had to go elsewhere because they had no more room and others already waiting. Which is a total bummer! At least that says something good about the food though,eh? \nThe food is really good, fresh and a great value for the price. (Enough for dinner and leftovers) However, be very careful about the spice scale, cause it's nuts. My hubby usually gets like an 8 at most places, but he got a 4 here and it was BEYOND spicy. Like, he had to throw it away cause it burned so bad kinda spicy. I got a 1 cause I'm a wuss and it was perfect :)\nOther than that, they are super friendly and I really hope they increase their seating capacity, cause we enjoy eating here!",2
"Stopped in on a Friday after work, asked to see a drink menu and ordered a bud light lime. The waitress came back and apologized she did not have any. I looked at the menu again and ordered some sort of cider. The waitress returned and informed me that they do not have that beer either. I ended up ordering a bud light bottle which was skunky. \n\n We had a few friends join us, one ordered a scotch and soda, when he asked what kind of scotch they had, the bartender held up a bottle of Jim Beam!?!? He then asked for Brady and was told they did not have any and ended up settling on a beer.  Needless to say....we won't be coming back :)",1
"I very rarely give any place one star but this was an extremely disappointing dining experience. If it wasn't for it being restaurant week I definitely would have complained. But the proceeds were going to three square so I held my tongue. Let's start with the cheese platter my friend and I ordered... I'm no cheese expert but I have had my fair share of cheeses and actually have tried a few at different tapas restaurants. I kid you not I'm pretty sure the cheeses on this so called \""Spanish cheese platter\"" were Brie, Swiss, Parmesan and some blue cheese. One small piece each at $16! Oh also, when the server dropped off our dishes, he didn't explain anything to us. Didn't bother to let us know the ingredients or describe the dishes to us whatsoever. My lobster gazpacho was just ok. Nothing bad but nothing special. Let's move onto my main course, crispy chicken... More like chicken fingers that had no seasoning and overly salty potato and chorizo on the bottom. Terrible. My friends pork chop was way over cooked. It was like eating jerky. The chocolate molten cake was good, the only thing good from the whole meal. If you want good tapas in Vegas... Go to Jaleo, hands down way better and worth the price.",0
"The tea is pretty great, no doubt about that. However, the customer service was a little overwhelming and I left a little more than discouraged.\n\nI got a blend of their coconut ginger oolong with their maharaja chai Oolong Tea. I love it, I'm trying to ration it even though I got 7 oz. I paid nearly $40 for tea and a canister (that I thought I was required to buy, not knowing that there was a paper bag alternative). I realize as a consumer it's my responsibility to ask questions before purchasing a product but I came in for tea, not a car.\n\nThe sales associate was nice and enthusiastic. She pulled out at least five containers for me to smell, telling me the health benefits of each of the different types of tea. I noticed the amount per ounce, which, again, not thinking too deeply, allowed her to have her way when scooping. While she was weighing the tea, I could read the amount she had weighed in, but never throughout the weighing process did she tell me how much per ounce or how much the 3~ ounces would cost me. I finally realized I bought more than my intended two ounces per mix when she rang it up. Not cool. Again, the canister thing was what bothered me. She mentioned it was $7 but even with my polite attempt to say that it wasn't really for me, she continued with the, \""it's airtight and it'll stay fresh longer!\"" shtick. I would have stored it in a coffee can or one of my numerous other plastic containers.\n\nI give it two stars because the tea is really good.",1
"I wanted to like this place because it is literally a stones throw from my house but...I just can't do it.   The decor is great.  The bar looks cool.  Service is very good and friendly.   Even the apps are good.  But the main dishes are overpriced, small quantity and lacking flavor.  I didn't get the Pho...maybe that was my problem.   The menu is weak. Outside of the apps.  They have pho, vermicelli and rice dishes.  That's it.  Very very disappointed!  Chandler Pho is 100 times better.  I won't be back until they fix it.",1

"i'm a bit disappointed with this restaurant, but perhaps my expectations were set a little too high.  First of all, don't let them trick you into thinking the last three salads are entree sizes.  I asked them about the seared ahi tuna salad size and they said it was entree size.  What I received was about 4 slices of seared tuna and maybe about 10 bites of greens.  Boy, did I need another \""entree\""  or maybe it was the wicked spoon buffet that stretched out my tummy.  I also ordered warm chicken with brie with french fries.  Their french fries were thin almost like chips rather than french fries, which I was disappointed with.  The sandwich was good but needed more chicken so that the sides can have more than  just bread and onions.  Seriously, for $13 they should be able to put a bit more chicken.  The steak frite was not bad but not great either.",1
"My bad experience here started with dirty silverware and menus.  Our server Jose was very rude and didn't know much about his menu.  We ordered a half bottle of wine and were not presented with the cork then he asked \""do you want to taste it?\""  It should be automatic to present the cork and pour a taste of the wine.  The lump crab artichoke dip was good but needed salt.  The lobster bisque was the worst I've ever had.  It came out in a mustard yellow color with maybe 2 pieces of lobster in it.  Horrible flavor.  Next the server asked me how I wanted my prime rib cooked like I get a choice.  Prime rib is always served rare to medium rare.  If you want the $30 three course you should know that you can only have the french onion soup, meatloaf, some kind of chicken or a small steak as the main course, and I don't remember the dessert.  I will never eat here again.",0
"I HAVE WALKED OUT OF THIS PLACE 3 TIMES now and won't be back. I had no choice but to walk out because the wait staff purposely ignore customers in this joint.

You walk in, get seated, and then get intentionally ignored by pathic waiters who do not want to work.\n\nDon't bother eat here you will not be served. The food is overpriced Applebees anyway. I did eat here one time and the food was UNEDIBLE!!! The meatballs were rock hard. It was absolutely disgusting. No human being could eat such garbage.",0

We didn't feel like customers we felt like we were an inconvenience.\n\nThe thing is that we didn't mind waiting our turn but someone could have come and said,  \""we know you have been waiting a long time and we will be with you as soon as we can.\"" but instead we were treated like crap. \n\nMy suggestion for anyone needing professional make-up in Vegas is to skip the MAC store and go to Bobbi Brown.",0
"I want to love this place so much.  I want to roll around nekkid with it.  But sadly I had a very disappointing experience there.  We lucked out and got a seat at the bar in the basement.  The basement is one of the coolest places to take a date in town. The atmosphere and wine did not disappoint.  I ordered their caesar salad with shrimp. When asked if I wanted it grilled or blackened, I chose grilled. Sadly when my salad arrived, the shrimp had been blackened and all moisture evaporated from them.  They were like chewy Stretch Armstrongs.  When I pointed this out to the bartender, she simply said, \""that's how it comes.'  I get that not everyone's tastes are the same.  But I cannot think of anyone who would have enjoyed gnawing on these poor little creatures who sat sadly in a bed of lettuce cores and stems.  The brie toast was amazing, so they are capable.\n\nI will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere.  They SO need to fix the quality of their food or at least their service when something like this happens.",1
"This will be my last contract with Verizon. I just bought the droid razr. I did not get any kind of a deal for signing to a new contract after being eligible for an upgrade. Not only that but when I went to Costco the phone was cheaper. When I went into the Verizon store in Chandler to inform them of this they said \""Oh yeah, we know that\"" then snickered. Oh wow, nice reaction!!! \""We ripped you off and think it's funny\"" Not only that but at the same time I bought the Xoom as a gift. Don't tell me you don't throw in a few extra's every now and then. That may be a policy but to say it's not done is an outright lie. Greedy cheats. I am livid at this treatment. I think perhaps it is time to bite the bullet and pay to get out of my contract or check to see if I have a grace period to get out. It's only been 5 days.",0
"I took my dog here for a checkup after we adopted him and WOW we paid a lot more than we would've elsewhere. Welcome to Shadyside!\n\nWe got charged $13 for antibiotics (which we could have gotten for much less or free at Giant Eagle's Pharmacy. The option was never given to me). Dr. Cangin recommended this really expensive flea + tick + heartworm medicine, and the woman at the front desk gave me her own advice and said to just use K9 Advantix and Heartgard since the medicine the vet recommended was expensive and made the other receptionist's dog sick. Say what now? Talk about conflicting. I was charged $25 for 'Cytology - Otic' which was swabbing his ears and checking the samples with a microscope for infection, $40 for ear ointment to treat a yeast infection in the dog's ear (not sure this could have been cheaper elsewhere), and $49 for 'Exam - Problem Oriented'. Whatever that means other than $CHA-CHING$\n\nThe round of antibiotics we got was only for 14 days and didn't knock out his skin infection. It came back with a vengeance not long after the antibiotics were through. When we took him to the clinic at the ARL 3 weeks later they couldn't believe EEVMC didn't give us steroids to reduce the inflammation from his scratching in addition to a longer round of antibiotics. Which explains why he never stopped scratching and the infection never had time to go away, or his skin time to heal.\n\nWe were pretty unimpressed. To top it off, when we called for a second appointment after his skin inflammation got WAY worse they couldn't get us an appointment for 4 days. I get that they're busy but are you really going to allow my dog to scratch himself raw for a superfluous amount of time because you're booked?? You can't possibly squeeze me in somewhere? I would have taken any appointment at any time with no notice. The ARL was much more accommodating, and we only paid $15 for our appointment there since it was our first appointment after adopting him. They still would have been cheaper either way, though.\n\nPretty meh about this vet, as convenient as its location may be.",1
Charging restaurant prices for fast food : $11 for a plain burger and fries cooked THEIR WAY -well done - or the hwy.  The kids working behind the counter were very nice but there's nothing they could do about it.\n\nConsumers (including Yelpers ) seem to hold low expectations for their money.,0
"I usually go to Regal Stonecrest Cinemas 22 because (a) I'm in the area shopping or dining already, (b) they offer movie options (including 3-D screenings) that other places don't, or (c) because they have so many theaters, they're showing the movie I want to see at the time I want to see it.   Other than that, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this particular theater.  It's usually very crowded with teens who just like to \""hang out\"" in the lobby or outside, the ticket lines move slowly, the automatic ticketing machine is usually broken and/or isn't set up to accept my Regal movies rewards card, their rewards program isn't that great, and the lobby (especially the snack counter) and theaters aren't as clean as they should be.  Regal could learn A LOT from AMC Theatres in many respects.",2
"Every time I come here I expect to get better service than the time before.. and I'm always wrong. The servers seem as if they're too busy to care. There's always a crowd at night and people like to spend more than just a couple minutes here.  Parking can be difficult in this complex too. I don't think the boba is exceptional to make up for the poor service either. I guess if you with good company and you're craving boba late at night, this is just where everyone goes..",0
"It was my first time here and will probably be the last. My bf decided to take me here for July 4th dinner before we hit the fireworks. Our waitress, Ashley, took our order and never came back. We got our food from another girl and she took care of us. Our burgers were plain and it was like they were stingy with the bbq sauce when it was supposed to have bbq sauce on it. Can't even taste it. Our drinks was emptied for a long time, and no one seemed to care. There was a man in a green shirt, maybe he's the manager or whatever he was, but he was walking around talking on his phone. That's just rude. If you're gonna talk on the phone, go somewhere else, don't come walking around everyone talking. He walked by us a couple of times and act as if he didn't see our empty cups. The first waitress came back and had the nerve to ask \""Can I wrap this up for you?\"" \n\nReally? Does it look like I'm done?!! \n\nShe don't even come check on us or refill our drinks and, when she does come check on us, she asked us to leave? How RUDE?!\n\nSo at the end of our meal, we get a survey to take, and I wrote my honest opinion on it and I'm sure she threw that paper away because I did NOT right good about her.\n\nSo, thanks a lot, Cowfish, for making this year the worst July 4th dinner.",1

We were hoping for some great happy hour specials, but it was only so-so. They seemed a little understaffed as we were halfway through our wings without plates or even a boat to put our bones in. The wings were ok, but I think I prefer our normal spot more. \nThe positives were the normal d\u00e9cor which is fun and they had several large TV's. The staff was friendly just slow.

"Lazy,  lazy!!  IT HAS SLIPPED big-time, this week, at least. Usually one of my favorite LV restaurants, Olives let me down--and on a special occasion, too. \n\nSpecifics: The Caesar salad included relentless little chunks of hard, unripe tomato (???), stale croutons, and no anchovy at all, that I could taste. Well, maybe they waved one over the romaine, but the dressing was SO bland, and of course there was no salt or pepper on the table, this being such a special place.  Well.\n\nRicotta ravioii with Italian sausage: gummy pasta, raw-tasting tomato \""sauce,\"" virtually unseasoned, and very light on the sausage, too, though I finally found a couple of pieces hiding out.\n\nDessert: Nice generous portion of coconut creme brulee, very good, but with a little PARROT MESS of a topping (mango something), and two sugar cookies that were not just stale, but \""off,\"" as in bitter-bordering-on-rancid.\n\nOkay. No, I didn't complain or send anything back. I was a guest, and it was, as I mentioned, a special occasion. But they should at least TRY, even on a Tuesday night. \n\nGeneralities: Okay, I know Las Vegas food likes to be \""fancy,\"" perhaps thinking that helps to justify the prices, but really, parts of the menu were such an overwrought throwback! I never thought anyone could make softshell crab sound bad, but bragging about a watermelon panzanella salad (olives, feta croutons, etc.) really ruined it for me.  On wonderful softshell crab?  What, they don't have any confidence in their own dish, or their cooking abilities? \n\nAnd who could make CAKE sound bad? Well, describing it as \""dirty south styled almond cake\"" did the trick.

"Sadly, classic case of caveat emptor in Vegas. Truely a unique experience, I've recommend RRL to everyone.  I would like to think it was just a bad night, but alas my experience is likely indicitive of a bigger issue.\n\nThe bottom line: since last visit prices increased and portion size decreased. (I wish I had realized this last night as the owner happen to be seated at a table behind us with his friends and we had a long conversation about how much we loved the place.)\n\nTook a friend for her 40th birthday as a treat. At first glance in looking at the menu the prices seamed higher than I recalled, but not until comparing reciepts at home today (and the menu here in yelp) was it confirmed. I also left last time feeling full and satisified. This time ordered more and more, but alas left not so full.\n\nExamples of some of the changes:\n- Calamari\n    Previous Price: $10 (also price they show on menu online) \n    Last night: $14\n\n- Short Rib Stoganoff\n    Previous Price: $19 (also price they show on menu online) \n    Last night: $34 \n   Also, look at the pics of fellow yelpers, it used to be 3 portions of rib with  pieces of pasta. Last night it was only 1 with garnish. (not exactly a big plate portion as indicated)\n\nFor roughly the same meal, last time our check was just under $200 for 2 people including a bottle of wine. Last night, with the addition of a flatbread, but otherwise the same meal just over $400.  ouch!\n\nThere are more examples, but you get the idea. I'm sure RRL would say they are just a business adjusting prices based on food costs, and the one time out-of-towners on expense accounts won't bat an eye.\n\nAs a local this went from being my go-to-special plate, to a place that's not quite worth it. (sadly)  \n\n\nSince RRL has entertainment, they charge the LET tax plus sales tax (18%), so that on top of inflated prices and smaller portions...  too much for this gal.\n\nI'm including my prvious review below as context .\n\nReview from 8/22 visit 5 Star\nWell done RRL. While the ticketed show is closed, the restaurant has incorporated 30 minute acts that change & evolve throughout the night. Think speak-easy meets super club with modern tapas plates and a cocktail & wine list fit for foodies.\n\nThe food, entertainment, service and decor are top notch. Perfect for a special night out or client entertaining. \n\nI will be back.",2

"McGill ghetto favorite is often hailed to be the best pizzeria in Montreal.  Now Montreal ain't exactly known for pizza but this is still way off the mark. I can name five or six places off the top of my head that are better. Amelio's is only the \""best\"" if the only point of reference is the ubiquitous 99 cent garbage. Amelio's pizza is greasy with generic low-quality cheese, cardboard crust and unremarkable toppings. I used to live close by so I'd go on occasion since there's not really much in the area. The last time I went I vowed never to go again and I haven't. We were a group of four trying to catch a quick bite before going to see a movie at Cinema du Parc. There was only one table free when we entered. The table was for six people. The waitress refused to let us sit in that table because she said that it was reserved exclusively for parties of six. It didn't matter if no one was there, we couldn't sit there because we were only four. We argued a bit but it wasn't working so we ended up waiting and finally got a table after a ten minute wait. And guess what? Nobody ended up sitting in the \""table for six\"" and we missed our film. Thanks, Amelio's!  We should have left. Next time I'll walk five minutes to Eurodeli on St. Laurent (which has better and cheaper pizza in any case).",1
"This review is for the tour only, not the beer (which is quite good) or food (which we didn't have). While waiting for the tour, a waitress came over to take our food order. We didn't realize they even served food, we just thought it was a brewery, and she gave us a weird look when we said we were just here for the tour. Our tour guide Jimmy was drunk. He was staggering around, waving his arms, stumbling over his words (couldn't pronounce Mecklenburg), taking swigs of the Southside Weiss. It was rather like watching Captain Jack Sparrow give a tour, except with beer not rum. It seemed a bit odd and was certainly distracting. Seeing the tanks and everything in the brewery was cool and interesting, but our inebriated tour guide wasn't very knowledgeable. If you want a sampler of their beers, you have to pay, which is ok I guess because the tour is free. I wanted to buy a 6 pack of their summer seasonal Rein Pale Ale, but they didn't have it yet. Memorial Day weekend and you don't have your summer seasonal out yet? They like to tout that the furniture in the brauhaus is from Germany. Who cares? That doesn't affect the taste of the beer. I do like how they adhere to the German purity laws in their beermaking process, though. This ensures that the brew is true to the original art form made famous by Germany, and that you are getting quality beer from people who care about their product.",1
"A truly horrible experience and a complete waste of $100 pp. \nThe problems begin quickly with rude unattentive service. Failure to bring drinks promptly, failure to bring extra plates, failure to even have chopsticks on the table, failure to bring prepared sushi on time. \nThe food, the lobster miso, is frankly gross. The rolls small and outrageous prices even for Vegas and all of em fell apart as we tried to eat them.  I know MGM is hurting financially and have drastically even cut back comps to  a bare minimum, but come on $16-17 for a  sashmi salad? Their signature roll is horrible.  The saki prices though were avg for vegas, but you needed several bottles just to choke down the pork we ordered.

It tasted identical, and just as bad as,  he guacamole in a jar at a grocery store. The fajita seasoning was extremely salty. Both my fajitas and my friends arroz con pollo suffered from raw vegetables. I know this place is new but there isn't exactly a paucity of mexican restaurants in the area. I wont be going back.",0
"This was an awful experience start to finish. We entered and noticed right away that the place looked rundown - cheap art, bad carpentry, and water damage to the drop ceiling with missing tiles.  We were told to sit anywhere and after a long wait (20+) our waitress stopped to take our order. Requested a beer - the tap was not working which in hindsight was probably a blessing as the best part of the entire meal was the bottle of Carlsberg. \n\nWe ordered  guacamole - and were told they were out of it. After changing our choices, the waitress returned to tell us they are out of the sauce for the spicy shrimp? Not a great start but it gets worse. \n\nThe apps come out and were ok. We then waited over an hour for the entrees while watching surrounding tables be seated AND get their food.  My companion had ordered the mushrooms which came out and were so salty as to be inedible. We told the waitress who merely gave a perfunctory \""sorry\"" and removed the plate. After another 15 minute wait, the remainder of the meal arrived. The lamb was of course well overcooked and the shrimp dish again overly salted. \n\nThe waitress was apologetic and blamed the kitchen. The wait was horrible, the ambiance nonexistant, the prices too high and the quality of the food about what you could expect from your local 7-11. All in all one of the worst dining experiences in Montreal.",0
"Ahhhh...heavenly Marriott bed, how I love thee.  The best thing about a full-service Marriott is their beds.  Hands down.  After working 12 hour days I know I can climb under the fluffy down comforter and fall asleep within minutes.  Those beds are the bomb people.  The beds at this Marriott didn't disappoint...but the rest of the hotel fell a little short.  It's an older property and a little overdue for a makeover.  Simply put, it's just not the nicest Marriott I have ever stayed in.  Maybe it's the location (downtown Mesa is not the most exciting place) but the hotel was pretty vacant when I was staying there.  My guess is that the hotel management's theory is that if there are no guests there to accommodate, why bother putting forth the effort.  The staff was nice, not the best but definitely not the worst.  The housekeeping didn't skimp on the cleaning...but they definitely skip on the towels.  Maybe they were ticked off that I used the majority of my towels each day (hey, I'm 2 shower a day gal with the wicked hot temps in Phoenix!) but there were 3, yes 3, days that I was left towel-less.  Zero.  Not even a wash cloth.  I learned my lesson after the first time and always checked to make sure I have towels BEFORE getting into the shower, but come on people.  Towels are just SUPPOSED to be there; right along with the free Bath and Body Works shampoo and lotion that has a weird scent they don't even sell in the stores.  Each time I called the front desk they would have towels to my room within minutes, but the point is that I shouldn't even have to worry about not being stocked with towels.  If it wasn't for the fact that I had to \""air-dry\"" one night after my shower, I would probably have given this property 3 stars.  As a previous reviewer stated they do give you milk and cookies each night if you are on the executive floors so that was a nice touch.  But the towel thing irritated me, so it will stay a 2.",1
"This small restaurant caught the eye of my wife and I for breakfast.  The decor, ambience, and service were great.  The food wasn't.  We both ordered the breakfast combos (one with frencht toast, one with pancakes) with eggs, bacon, and toast.  The breakfast was comparable to a Jimmy Dean or Swanson frozen breakfast.  Sadly, this breakfast totaled around $30. Ouch.",1
"My husband and I took our truck \""mudding\"" - (out driving around in the mud) and his truck was covered. I decided to surprise him and have his truck detailed since he has been working so hard lately. Because of the reviews I was really excited to see the finished product. \n\nWhen I first pulled up the system was a little confusing, some sort of signage for newbies like me could have been helpful. I walked inside and was greeted by someone that I had to ask \""Do you work here\"" because frankly, I couldn't tell! Either way he was very nice and told me to pull the truck around the corner where he would meet me to discuss a price. \n\nI got back into my truck and met with the man (I never got his name!) where we had decided on $100 for a full exterior detail. For $100 I expect the outside to be shining. EVERYWHERE. My truck was washed and then pulled into the detail area. I waited for a little over 2.5 hours for them to be finished. It was dark outside so I could not fully see everything. I drove straight home and waited for my husband to see his surprise! In the dark it looked shiny, from afar. \n\nOverall the truck looks good. There was a lot of spots that were missed and there is still a lot of dirt on the underside, the rims of the truck and I was surprised at how much dirt there was in the crevices by the windows. I'm pretty sure a light spray could have fixed that. There were some spots when I went out this morning to look but mostly I was just disappointed by the dirt that was still there.\n\nI may go back again. I don't know. I probably wont get the exterior detail due to the price and the fact that someone who got the express detail $40 looked just as good as the $100 that I paid.",2
This place isn't great...Food was okay...Service was ehhhh & I probably go back if coworkers wanted to but I'd probably talk them to going somewhere else...So a party of 6 was like $300--Tip is included for a party that is...Be WARNED!!!! Happy hour has great prices but you can only do soooo much with happy hour...You know!!!,1
"Wow, I'm going to be the black sheep here and give this restaurant only two stars.  When my husband and I entered for lunch a few days ago, the manager or owner was talking on the phone.  We stood by politely waiting, until he pointed us to sit *with his CHIN* - the phone still strapped to his ear, never once addressing or welcoming us to sit by words!   I was surprised, but didn't say anything.  \n\nThe restaurant itself was really dark inside, there were no lights turned on at all, just a little natural light coming from the small heavily curtained windows.  Nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in my line of thinking, so this restaurant just failed in these respects.   \n\nThe buffet itself was fine, nothing was amazing nor was anything bad.  After we sat with our food, the same manager brought a basket of naan and actually TOSSED it down onto our table as he walked by without even making eye contact with us, still jabbering away on his phone.   My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed, it was that bizarre!\n\nNeedless to say, I will not be going back.  There are other Indian buffets in town that serve great food, have an inviting ambiance and treat me like a valued customer.",1
"Got a great priceline price of $55 with a free breakfast (hot entree with oj and coffee)  and free shuttle from the airport til 10pm and a free happy hour with light snacks.\nNow the downside:\nThe place is old and run down, outside looks great with the 2 pools, and tennis courts but when you get in the rooms, they are old, musty and dated.  \nThere is a kitchenette with fridge and microwave and toaster oven inside the room.\nWhen I checked in late night, the staff wasn't very helpful, felt like I was bothering them.\nSince the place is so large and the doors open to the outside, doesn't feel as secure for a single female traveler.",2
"We hired them to move from the bay area to Las Vegas. After much research we decided to go with this local company because their price was the most reasonable, and they could do packing, moving, and unpacking. We called and gave them requested information such as square footage of the house and list of furniture we had. When we tried to tell them more details, such as number of rooms in the house, they didn't want the information. They said it would be no problem and gave us an estimate of 5 hours for moving and packing, which we were shocked, but they assured us that they have very experienced movers. When the guys arrived, however, they acted very surprised by how much they were supposed to pack and move. They later told me it's because houses are built differently in San Francisco vs. Las Vegas, they didn't expect so many rooms given the square footage. But we did gave them a list of furniture and number of boxes before their arrival! Anyway, they were able to hire two extra men on site and managed to finish the job. I have to say I was very worried watching them pack. They wrapped nothing, even glassware, and just throw it into the box loosely. Luckily the hired men from another company (McCarthy Moving and Storage) handled our baby grand piano and they did a superb job. When we arrived in Las Vegas, there were only a few damages: the front wheel and basket was broken of a bike, and a beautiful arm chair was stained on the side. It was a great relief. The movers were hard working and courteous and tried to do the best job given the situation.\n\nI think overall if you pack everything yourself or move within Las Vegas, or have nothing super valuable like a grand piano, this company is fine. But with our experience I would most likely look for another company the next time we move.",1
"I went to the Farmers Market to walk around in the glorious warm sun and left with pretty much just carbs...I bought bread, pasta and unfortunately, bagels from Gotham.  The bagels themselves weren't bad...nothing to write home about in my opinion..but not awful.  It was the service that is really why I would never go back.  I waited in line with a friend-she ordered her bagels and then I went to order next and was VERY loudly accused of cutting in line by a rude man who seemed to think he was in charge.  I calmly explained that I was waiting here the entire time and then started to order the bagels but he was extremely short and rude with me the entire time.  No time for that-I'll get my bagels from Bagels Forever instead!",0
"This place was disappointing on many levels. Tried the only two beers they had, the first (Mario beer) tasted worst than miller lite. And the other was $21 for a pint of mediocre beer. The pizza sauce tasted like raw tomatoes. A good pizzeria should make sure the sauce is cooked properly. The desert was another thing. I ordered two types of gelato and they told me they wanted to charge me more if they serve them separately!? WTF? Oh and you can't change or alter any menu item because the great Mario wants it served a certain way. \n\nI won't be back here ever again.",1
"Miserable, through no fault of the staff. There was just something about this particular Target - the worst, angriest, weirdest customers in the world just seem to flock here. There were shouting fights in the aisles and the family in front of me in line left an entire grocery cart full of merchandise there without paying and just walked out.\n\nStrange, terrible place, this Target.",0
"I came here with my family during lunch time this Friday afternoon. We were craving Korean food before we go grocery shopping at Greenland. I suggested that we should go to a Korean ayce bbq on Spring Mtn. (like Honey Pig, or Tofu Hut) but since we were on the cross-street S. Decatur we decided to go to the plaza this restaurant is located in anyways.\n\nThe food was okay, nothing special or \""delicious\"" as the restaurant name says. It was just eatable. We ordered their ojingeo bokkeum (some squid dish), hot bibimbap, and tofu soup. Their bibimbap was so plain :( I definitely had better bibimbap at other Korean restaurants I've been to. Their bibimbap really lacked flavor. The only thing I liked was their handful of banchan, especially the kimchi and pickled daikon. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean, a lot of tables and seats. I think it is one of the biggest restaurants in the whole plaza and we were the only ones eating there. It's the only restaurant in this plaza without a wait and now I can see why. Now, if we went to Monta Ramen or Curry Zen around this time it would be packed! I seriously still wonder how this place even affords rent in Chinatown. The owner who served us spoke really good English and was nice though. +1\n\nOur total came out to be about $60 for three of us, which is pretty steep considering the food wasn't that good. Generous portions but I'd rather have quality over quantity. Even ayce bbq tastes better and can have more variety! We definitely could of had better food at a cheaper price somewhere else nearby. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.",1
your staff is ignorant and rude. the girls on the telephone are nasty and laughed at me when i called twice about my problem. i waited 30 mins over the expected delivery time to get an order that had no sauce which i paid for and half my order not there. i called not 2 mins after he left and they said it would be another hour just for the sauce alone. you guys suck. horrible service. im contacting district.,0
"The food was really good! Ordered the Chicago style pie and did not disappoint. Also ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was just \""okay\"". Was more like a giant chicken finger on bread - however, the bread was really good, too!  Our biggest disappointment was with the young lady working the front. This was our first time trying rosatis's and the service seemed icy cold from the minute we walked in. It seemed clearer to us that we could have been being judged by the employee as everyone else who came in got warm greetings, follow up and friendly conversation.   I'm pretty certain the money from gay people is just as good as everyone else's.  This is simply an observation and how we were made to feel during our dining in experience.",1
"The Luxor is OK - nothing much to get excited about.  If you just want a place to sleep - this is probably a good place.  The price attracted me to the property.  The room, however, while very clean, was very dated and much in need of a facelift.  Not impressived by furniture with holes in the fabric and other worn out furniture - regardless of the price.  The elevators and public areas were also noticeably in need of repair and update.  I saw some work being done in the lobby - perhaps the rooms should become a priority.\n\nI don't understand why the Luxor really has very little in the way of restaraunts and bars.  You have to go to one of the adjoining hotels for those amenities.\n\nThe timeshare people are very disruptive and annoying - but given the number of complaints, the management really must not care about that.\n\nOverall, if the price is right, I probably would stay at the Luxor again, but it would have to be a great deal.",1
Went there to wait for friends on the roller coaster. When asked If we were eating I said I wasnt sure and was seated in their restaurant area. Ordered a drink and was given bread. When my friends returned we decided to each have a drink and walk back to our hotel. The waiter had a snit and busses our table of everything. Even took the bread from in front of me! Did I say there wasn't a soul in there? Rude rude rude don't waste your money,0
"For people who are on a budget, this actually is a great, comfortable hotel. However, every night, when I would come back to the room after my conference was over, the room smelled of mold. I'd call house keeping and they'd come spray febreez and put an air freshner. Then, I'd have to crank on the AC because the smell of the freshners were strong. All in all, it wasn't a pleasant experience and I hope next time I am in Las Vegas, I can stay at one of the nicer hotels.",1
"Just do yourself the favor and book with a different airline. Wait time is an average of an hour- always less than 5 people working the ticket counter when the line is 150 people deep. My work books me on this airline so I fly it about two or three times a month- do yourself a favor and just pay the extra couple bucks for ANY OTHER AIRLINE. If you are even close to your departure time- just know that you will not make your flight due to the terrible way US Airlines is run. The seats are the smallest out of all the airlines, and quite honestly the whole experience is disgusting- seats are never cleaned in between flights which means you are sitting in someone else's crumby leftovers. Lastly, the restroom floors are covered in a sticky layer of piss! Good job US.",0
"New York vs. Montreal bagels. The everlasting debate.\n\nQuite simply, I think you will forever be loyal to whatever bagel you have been raised to eating. As a native New Yorker, I was excited to go to Montreal to try these out, and Fairmount Bagel was apparently the place to go. During weekend mornings, expect to wait on a line that goes out the door, but that doesn't say much considering the standing area in the place is as small as a closet. That's not an exaggeration.\n\nI went with the classic sliced lox and plain cream cheese on a plain bagel. It was tasty! For those who are unfamiliar, Montreal(-ian?) bagels are a little smaller, and made with honey, to give them a distinctive sweet flavor, and have a noticeably chewy texture to them. Very different from their New York counterpart.\n\n-2 for the no seating, not even any standing space. And because I while I didn't totally love it, it was still pretty good. \n\nIf in new in Montreal and have any appreciation for bagels whatsoever, Fairmount Bagels is a must.",2
"Came for AYCE when a huge group of friends came to visit me and my cousin from Los Angeles. We used to live in the Spring Valley area and always passed this. So our big party went. \n\nSo I ordered for myself, thinking to start slow with what I can handle- 1 roll and nigiri and a tempura. Others followed suit with their orders- some not holding restraint on their orders and most are \""roll happy\"". So rolls started to come out....I found mine and happily ate it...then more rolls and more rolls that everyone else ordered. A few nigiri made it, but none were the pieces I ordered....only the basic, tuna, salmon etc someone else ordered...maybe 12 pieces and thats all we saw the whole night. So many rolls kept rolling in...so many in  fact that we had to cancel anything else we ordered to get through rolls on our table. A few we couldnt even figure out who the hell ordered it...if any of us ordered it at all!  I had to help everyone else eat their rolls so we dont get charged a la carte. I dont like rainbow rolls- I did not come to eat california roll with some fish on top! There was too much rice to me in the rolls, hence stuffing us all up.  I did not like how they did not pace us or bring each person what they ordered like other AYCE's do. I had no problem at places like Sushi Mon serving us as individuals in a group..and I like that when you order nigiri first then thats what you'll get...they dont \""forget\"" the order and skip to the rolls. \n\nThe server didnt look too happy with us too and was crabby serving us- this time I can't blame them. Normally me and my brother had to speak/apologize for the group. Mind you they dont know how to shut up most of them....they're so loud the deaf can hear it...but also we've never had ALL the loud ones in a group dinner with us...it was the complete symphony of cackling gays.  Kinda embarrassing and I apologize if you were there on a night a party of 12 gays were there with me and had to hear their bullshit. If I was any of you, I woulda slapped all of us. \n\nIt was just not a pleasant night at all and though my friends are asses, if the staff served like other AYCE's did we wouldnt have had problems with being roll overwhelmed. \n\nI still cant get near anything with crab or I gag and this was months ago. \n\nMaybe I'll come back as a friend said they really like the sushi chef here and is a regular, but I dunno.  Maybe the BF and I will come with the our friend who loves this place to give it a fair rating.",2
"The wings are great but sometimes the service is less the spectacular. On our last visit we were seated promptly but that's where the great service ended. It took about 5 minutes just to get water and about another 15 for straws. The staff looked like they were cleaning but it never appeared to get clean. So after we ordered the wings took longer than usual and another waitress brought them out (which is not a problem) but our server looked confused that we had food. That was also the last time we saw her. Never got refills and had to flag down someone after finishing and waiting for 15 minutes with empty baskets and drinks. Bdubs you have to step it up, you can't hope your wings make people forget lousy service!",2
"This hotel is a world away from a 4 star hotel.  The bathroom was filthy, full of other people's hair and who knows what else.  The front desk said that the room had been recently remodeled, however; the tile in the bathroom was cracked and full of mold, the toilet was chipped  and the plastic seat was very uncomfortable.  The complimentary shampoo etc was worse than a person would receive at a Motel 6 and the toilet paper was single ply, most rest areas on the highway have better..  The swimming pool was closed however; the hot tub was open which was also very dirty, full of leaves and cigarette butts.  Extremely disappointing.",0
"Wow, I don't know if I ever ranked a place this low. But I feel it is important to note the quality of service and food you'll receive here.\n\nWe began our night hoping for a reservation across the parking lot. When they were full we Yelped and found Marrakech right here so we gave it a shot. We were with a large group of 10 and were sat pretty quickly, about 15 minutes which was nice compared to the hour plus wait we left to come here. \n\nThe music was very loud and we requested it to be at a more realistic level so we could talk during their 5-6 course meal. It would have been strange to sit there that long and not be able to talk at all. Every 45 minutes or so they had a belly dancing show with even louder music, which is fine since it's not too often and made for the experience overall.\n\nIt took a while (15 to get our initial drinks) where we ordered wines. Even longer yet to receive any food such as apatizers or bread. We acctually had to ask to receive something after another 20 minutes of receiving our drinks. \n\nThe first place received was breads, humus, olives, etc. which was fine and the last quality food brought out. I won't go into the details of each dish to follow only to say for the expense we were not happy at all. \n\nThe wait staff was pleasant but very slow and lacked understanding of the level of sound and need to communicate ones there.\n\nThe place is neat looking inside and the concept is fun. Just won't be returning since food and service is too important.",1
"Ok I am going to start off by creating the scene for you all. Denny's is never on the list for a breakfast spot, but since we were on a job that was miles away from anything but a Dennys, we decided...What the hell. First off its always annoying being seated at a table between two huge families full of bratty, carpet munching, screaming children when the rest of the entire restaurant is empty..Browsing the menu in which even in the pictures of the food, the food still looks shitty... in rolls a man in a wheelchair with his leg literally sawed off at the knee. It wasnt bandaged or covered, just there for everyone to enjoy over breakfast. Our waitress hobbles over and we are assuming she is pulling a double after working the night shift. I order the 2 egg breakfast and my hubs orders the western omelet. When the food comes it seems not only the plate, my coffee cup and the food are all the same color. There is no color, no flavor, and no life to this food. Basically whatever ihop throws away, dennys recooks  and serves it to customers. So we are sitting there basically separating our food with forks, and even only after taking a few bites I wish to God I could force myself to throw up. Slowly my energy is being sucked out of me as my body tries to digest this salted load of crap...when the raging gas begins. I will tell you the only fun reason to go to Denny's, is they have the perfect \""Pleather\"" to really let your farts rip roar and soar.",0
"With the recent popularity and boom of ramen joints around Vegas, my expectations for Shoku were probably a tad higher than they should have been. Upon entering, there was no music playing, and the lack of chatter among customers made the place seem a little awkwardly quiet (jazz music began playing a little later, though).\n\nThe waitresses were obviously new and/or inexperienced. I ordered the spicy miso and my friend ordered the tonkotsu ramen with a side of gyoza. The waitress confidently presented our respective dishes - dishes that we almost immediately realized were switched. That could have just been a little mistake instead of a lack of knowledge, though.\n\nThe ramen was what ultimately made me decide to give Shoku three stars. I chose my noodles \""firm\"" and didn't expect to find a thick clump of noodles still stuck together in the middle of my meal. The chashu was not the soft texture I was used to, which made me a little disappointed.The broth was actually better than expected though - not too salty with a decent kick of spice. It was nice that ramen already came with a few toppings as well.\n\nThe gyoza were meh. They probably would have tasted better if they were hot and fresh but instead seemed cold and dejected. \n\nOn a random note, I was childishly fascinated with the sesame grinder they had on the table. The tables were also nice and clean and new. I spent a good 5 minutes stroking it...\n\nAll in all, Shoku is just okay. We decided to stop by only because we were already sort of in the area but if I were to choose, I would not go out of my way when there are so many ramen places closer to my house.",2
"Ate lunch here today, was a little disappointed in the price of the food and not real tasty. The Greek lemon rice soup was more of a lemon rice chowder, beware it is a bit salty but has huge lemon flavor. Also ordered the spinach cakes from the app menu.  I have had them numerous places before and they usually are delicious but not here, they did not have enough if any cheese in them and they were very greasy, which they should not be.  Also for $7.00 I expected much more than two small pieces.  The Lamb Kabob was just okay, the pita bread this time was not home made but store bought, bummer and the spices on the lamb did not really bring out the flavor.  The owner was okay, a smile or two and he warmed right up. Spending $25.00 for 2 apps and a kabob seemed very high considering the food was just so so if that much.  We will not be back",1
"Happy hour!!!!\n\nOk so not the greatest but still good guacamole pretty good quesadilla was ok margs nothing to write home about.... Jus sayin\n\nTime for fish tacos....... So I visited on Tuesday and I have to say the grilled fish and shrimp tacos are nothing to rave about, very dry chunk of fish with a little mango (i think) pico sauce.",1
"I hate people who write multiple reviews for the same restaurant, just to give the same ratings and restate what they posted in the original review- but my visits  were drastically different experiences. \n\nFood was underwhelming- had the Palm Beach roast beef and cheddar sandwich while BF opted for the pastrami. Portion of meat was large but the meat itself lacked flavor, and sandwiches were dry without any condiments.  \n\nWould have asked for mustard, but service is incredibly lacking. There were maybe four employees running around but  customers are waiting for checks, condiments, and silverware longer than they're eating. Disorganized and impersonal, lack of consistency in both service and food quality.",1
"I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the technician, Mandy, who does a beautiful job with my nails. I wouldn't step foot in that\nPlace if it wasn't for her.\nThe owner is a complete jerk. They don't schedule appointments correctly, so I wait 15-20 minutes for each appointment. Last week, they happened to be on time, and I showed up 6 minutes late- he gave away my appointment. He 'scolded' me and told me that his staff won't around for clients. I've been going there for 2 years and the first time late my appointment gets taken away. Horrible customer service. \nMandy is wonderful though!",2
"Our repair turned out fine, however, you completely get screwed over if you need to finance the charge! Their in-house financing charges an interest rate of 180% interest rate!! So our $1500 car repair turns into a $4200 repair if we don't pay it back within 90 days. Absolutely ridiculous! They know people are in a desparate situation needing to get their car fixed and not able to fork out $2000, so they take advantage of the situation. We're just going to pay it off with our credit card since at least that interest rate is less than 20% which is nothing considering theirs!!!!!",0
"Friendly employees.\nOk casino.\nSlow internet, worse than dial-up, 1 mb/s (not a typo). \nNo buffet.\nNo food court.\nNo shuttles.\nDirty pool.\nBad plumbing, our shower ran yellow...\nAC in rooms is weak.\nPaid continental bfast, no better than basic.\nPlayers card for casino is a waste of time.\nConcierge is useless/incompetent.\nVery limited show booking on site, and pay extra to print your tickets out.",0
"I had an appointment at 11:30, I was on time and I'm still waiting! If your time is valuable dont waste it here. Also while waiting I observed a few other clients complain how they overlooked a few details on their car. Wtf is the point of making appointments if they're not going keep them or at least give me a heads up and let me know they're backed up! I hate when people waste my time!",0
"This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers. \n\nI only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entr\u00e9es, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.",1

"This is the worst truck wash I have been to in 27 years in the trucking business. Please don't waste your money and a lot of your time here. The employees are screwing off, walking around and too lazy to scrub, only power wash. The guy supposedly in charge sent someone else out to look at the dirty left on my truck when I complained. That wash Josh in case the owner would like to fire someone. They have music cranked up so loud in the truck bays they can't hear you say what services you would like. I'm just sorry I had to leave a one star rating. They are at-3 stars.",0
"The Olive Tree was a pleasant caffeine stop before my band's late night gig recently in Edinburgh. We were attracted by the exterior which was welcoming and cosey! Upon arriving, it seemed the staff were surprised to see us! And it was empty besides a couple having food. We didn't let this put us off and indulged in some lattes!\n\nDespite being almost empty, a few of the tables were yet to be cleaned and that the staff still stood idly by. The cakes looked lovely but the cabinet wasn't the cleanest either which made us reluctant to come back and try them. \n\nThe toilet consisted of one large room which was dirty and lacking in toilet roll. Otherwise, my chai latte was lovely!",1
"Simply property management replied to my posting....but look at the other comments.  It isn't just me.  I just got back from Phoenix and my tenant told me that he had a really hard time renting the property as Simply property management was unresponsive to his requests to see the house for over 2 weeks.  He finally had to call his real estate person and have them show him the house.  Then he said that Simply property management was mad at him since they needed to pay him a commission.  Simply property management sent in maintenance people to do some calking and they stood on the toilet seat breaking the seat and bolts, then they charged me for the broken seat. Although I had personally gone down and cleaned the house with a cleaning service, when the tenant finally saw the house he said it was dirty with hair all over the stairs....it looked like someone had stayed there or had a long haired animal (possibly a workman?). Also, they were supposed to have a refrigerator put in, and they charged me a delivery charge, charged double for the refrigerator, but while delivering it, it fell or was dropped leaving a huge dent in the top and was VERY dirty. REMEMBER, it is now April.  They collected rent and deposits in January and I have still not received one cent!!!!  No matter what they say, collecting money from a tenant and not sending it to the owner is NOT acceptable.  They continue to hold my money hostage, saying they are going to charge an early termination fee and a year of \""computer\"" charge even though THEY CANCELLED ME!  Thank God they did, as it moved me to action.",0
"Small and overpriced with midget sharks that are a far cry from the pictures shown on the ads.  It should be free for mandalay bay visitors.  They force you to take a family picture - in fact, they won't even let you enter unless they take one.\n\nIt takes about 15 min to get through the whole acquarium.\nSome of the underwater buddhist backdrops are awesome though.",1
"Bought a groupon for dental cleaning because I haven't had one for 2 years, the cleaning was very light and ended shortly after it started. I would have given them 3 stars, but the staff obviously doesn't care for their patients, because I have now called 3 times over the past month to request a record of my X-ray be sent to my email (so it's 100% cost free to them) and have gotten NO response. I even obtained their email address on the phone (so I know it's the right one) and emailed my request, still nothing. It seems to me like they're purposely delaying my request to prevent me from seeking dental services from other providers, and that's just wrong coming from a medical establishment.  \n\nGuess I'll have to call every other day to get some attention. Until they email me my record, I'm not changing their rating. Avoid this place if you want to be treated like a human being.",0
"I reserved an Economy car online from Fox two months in advance.  When I arrived at  the Vegas Airport I had to go to the normal car rental shuttles. From there I rode to the Airport Car Rental Location. Then I had to walk to the cab area and wait for another shuttle from Fox. From there is was another 10 minute ride to Fox rental. At Fox rental office I was told that they didn't have any economy vehicles and that the only thing available was a 08 PT Cruiser. I expressesed to the agent that I didn't want a PT cruiser and that anything else wold work. He looked and got a set of keys but said it would cost $7 more perday for a differant car. PT cruiser wasn't even listed in their car list and had it been I would not have reserved with Fox. I ended up having to take the PT cruiser and was given a number to call to trade out cars if one was available. No one answered that number the next day. I finally had to spend 2 hours of my vacation on the phone talking to Fox Corporate. I was disconnected 3 times and it wasn't until I spoke with a supervisor that I was  able to get anything done. I had to drive back to the Rental to trade cars. Another hour of my vacation gone. They were very rude , at least the Scott that I spoke with and ended up giving me an even worst car with less gas mileage than the Cruiser. I think it wrong to advertise a class of car you don't even have, much less a make you don't advertise. When I returned home and checked the web on Fox I found that the rate I received should have given me a full sized car. The also refused to honor the car up grade coupon as well as one I had for 7% discount. I definately say if want to get a 3 year old PT Cruiser and be treated RUDELY this is you rental place. I personally will not return.  I don't like being told , take it or leave it.",0
"This is one of the few quality restaurants on Nun's Island. I like the location, the ample parking and the atmosphere of the restaurant. I have gone on several occasions, and while the first months were rocky terms of service and food quality, it seems to have improved. \n\nI don't find it particularly child friendly, though they do have high chairs there, it's more of the +18 crowd. \n\nThe food is better at the Bernard location, but I hope it will get better as they settle in.",2
"Okay, is it fair to write a review about a hotel that I spent approximately 8 hours in over the span of a 3 day period, either in an exhausted stupor or drunken haze??? Oh wait, this is normal for a Vegas vacation, right? \nCheck in here was a breeze at 4pm, and the lady was nice enough to change my room to a quieter location since she found that the room I had originally booked would have been next to the elevators. Thanks! The room was clean except for a few dubious stains on the floor, but I guess that comes with the territory. The biggest pro for me was how comfortable the beds were. Maybe it is the same when food tastes phenomenal after you have starved, but these beds were so comfortable that I felt rested even after 4 hours sleep. The biggest con for me was that it took 5 min for the water to heat in the shower. I was all about the ice cold showers after walking in the desert sun, but I don't like to wake up by freezing my arse off.\nTwo other bonuses were that they had a nice deli that was pretty cheap and the Paradise Cafe, open 24 hours, serves the yummiest breakfasts and has the nicest servers at 6am and they don't care if you are barefoot because your heels have worn a hole through your foot.\nOverall, this place is a great place to stay if you are there to see something at the hotel (I was there for the World Championship Muay Thai fights) or if you have a tight budget and don't mind being off the strip.",2
"Maybe I went on an off night but at this price, I would never expect an off night.\n\nThe staff is great and they recommended a really good bottle of wine.\n\nOn the other hand, the steak was pretty bad. It was cooked to order, a nice medium rare with outstanding sear, but it just didn't taste good at all. I just find it hard to ruin a rib eye. It was dry and very bland.\n\nI can't recommend anyone going here.",1
"I really wanted to like Taqueria Mi Casita, but it just wasn't very good.\n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and helpful, and it was nice to see them interacting with regulars and newbies alike. \n\nOrdered a Carne Asada burrito, and this sucker was PACKED full. \n\nUnlike typical Carne, this was finely chopped beef vs. chunks.\n\nNo big deal. What was a big deal is all I could taste was salt. :( \n\nHaven't been in a hurry to go back and see if this was a fluke, but definitely willing to give them a second chance per some recommendations Claudine F. made!",1
"This place is horrible. The service is so bad and the beer is inconsistent, at least they had some this time. The food was great but I don't know why it took over an hour to get it. Long story short I will not be returning to this place. Whoever owns this establishment should look for a new line of work.",0
"Yelp Challenge 2013: 36 /100 (....more like 3.5 stars) \n\nI am Nicaraguan and I was excited to take my boyfriend here. I couldn't wait for him to finally try authentic 'Nica' food. I had bookmarked this place a while ago.  When I saw the recent review in the Las Vegas Weekly Magazine, we decided to make our move.\n\nThe food here is authentic, delicious, affordable, and cooked with love. In fact, Dona Norma was in the kitchen preparing the meals. However, this place is an absolute hole-in-the-wall.  When you first pull up, you might be turned off by the location (read: not in the best area of town) or the eclectic d\u00e9cor (tables with plastic coverings). Don't let it steer you away. I repeat, don't let it steer you away. If you're looking to try something new, look past the exterior and give it shot.   \n\n\nHere is what I suggest you try:\n\n~ Cacao: Made with milk, cacao beans, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. \n\n~Fritanga Plate: This was my personal favorite. The plate included an assortment of carne asada (charbroiled beef), gallo pinto (rice and red beans seasoned with garlic), platanos maduros (sweet fried plantains), platanos fritos (plantain chips), traditional cabbage coleslaw, and queso frito (fried cheese that is traditionally salty and dry).\n\n~Nacatamale: Made with Masa de maiz (dough made of grinded corn and butter) , olives,  tomatoes, onions, potatoes, filled with pork and vegetables and steamed in a banana leaf.\n\nThe service was fairly good. There was only one guy waiting, busing, expediting, and running payment for orders. The restaurant was busy and the service was a bit slow. However, our waiter was very kind and he was really trying his best to attend to all the tables in a timely fashion. I really can't knock em' for trying their best. Come in with the mindset that this is run like a typical restaurant in Nicaragua.  \n\nIt is also important to note that Spanish is the first language at this place. The waiter spoke English, but I'm pretty sure he was the only one working who did. For those who don't speak Spanish, their menu includes English descriptions and photos. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal at Dona Norma. I am very happy to know that there is traditional Nicaraguan food available in Las Vegas. The place is not fancy, but sometimes you'll find some amazing food at places like this. We will be back.",2
"Just had dinner at this restaurant today.  The food here was expensive and doesn't taste like what it should be for the money that would have cost us if we had to pay (friend's family is a seven diamond patron, therefore was all comped). \n\nFood:\n-Grouper with the soy sauce and scallions-doesn't taste like anything buy soy sauce and scallion\n-green bean with xo sauce-the green beans have a nice crunch to it, but the sauce made it a bit salty\n-thin crisp noodles w/scallops, shrimps, and veggies-not my thing\n-clay pot with veggies, beef and other stuff-nah\n-salmon sashimi-i ate the piece that had a slice of lemon on top, the killed the buttery salmon flavor that i enjoy most...no bueno\n-hamachi-taste like it was previously frozen\n-passion tea with fresh fruits-YUMMMY!  we had even asked for some to go!\n-green tea icecream-you know how some icecream was in the freezer for quite some time and when you eat it, you can taste the ice filming on it?  yep yep, that's what I had.  In addition to that, the inside of my icecream ball was hollow :(\n\nService:  Server was slow and he was lingering around us as if he wanted us to get on out of his area.\n\nComped meal would have cost over $300, but don't think I will be going back for the yumilicious tea.",1
"The buffet was awful except for the cookies. I took a few. Heather, (280 pounds, unattractive male to female transsexual, 5'8\"", black hair, pit marks on face) told me she would call security. I returned the cookies and asked for my money back. I was simply told to leave or she would call security. I was holding my phone in my hand and she accuses me of photographing her and said she would have security arrest me. Leaving, I distinctly hear her say \""Fuck You.\"" \n\nI called and reported this to the Food and Beverage manager.\n\nI have called the bank and disputed the less than $9 charge. \n\nI took the $5 cash tip and told Heather, who replied that she didn't care. Shows how the Station Casinos care about their employees.\n\nI will not be patronizing Station Casinos again.",0
"I've come here on 3 occassions. All of them were because I was hungry and nothing else was open. Did what I had to do to survive. \n\nThe food isn't necessarily bad but it's not good either. It's very much ... it's hard to describe. Let me back up.\n\nI've dined here during the late night hours around midnight. You would think it would be slow considering the time but that is far from the case. Again, due to other sit down places being  closed at midnight, Perkin generates business for this reason alone. They serve typical diner food, breakfast, finger food, burgers, soups, etc. There are usually 2 servers working the entire diner. Services while good is very slow because waiters are working hard to be at more than one place at one time which is impossible. I give them credit for being as good as they are for that. Also, kudos to them for being professional. I've seen some extremely rude diners and they kept their composure. \n\nFood again isn't bad but it's your typical late night diner food. It serves it purpose for filling you up but it's nothing that is the finest quality. They are better known for their bakery. Once, I had a muffin and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Their pies and other pastries really do look appetizing I must admit and to be diner made, they are good. \n\nOverall, Perkins serves it purpose. To be a diner that stays open 24 hours and feeds people decent food.",1
"Love original Barrio Cafe and Barrio Queen in Scottsdale so thought airport Barrio was a blessing.  Had a bowl of posole and SMALL glass of wine for 26 (before tax and tip). Flight delayed so order the  \""large\"" 8 oz wine. Get the ck-$22.74. For ONE average size/quality glass of wine.  OUTRAGEOUS. The staff shares that owners been spotted once in whole time since place is open. Way to rip off your loyal local customers.",0
"We came here for dinner on my friend's bachelorette party. I really liked how the place look. The d\u00e9cor and colors are really nice. They are located in encore. \n\nI decided to order a Caesar's salad and their meatball sliders for my dinner. Everything just tasted okay. However my bread for my sliders was kind of burn. I don't get how a restaurant can serve burn crispy black bread. It would just be easier to just toast me up a new one. Sorry, I love my bread so to get bread that a two year old can toast up better really had to take off a star for that. \n\nOverall, it was just okay and wouldn't be back for a long time since there is so many better restaurant in Vegas for the price.",2
"The best description of the food is - mediocre \n\nThe service is mediocre \n\nIf you use the drive thru, then just do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.\n\nThere are a ton of hot dog hamburger joints around the valley, and this place is no better or worse than any other. \nThe service inside appears a little fluttered and clustered, but overall it works. It takes a few times to get use to it. \n\nThe drive thru is horrible. We watched some fellow approach a customer in a car to take his order, there was no menu to see so the customer said he cant order yet because he needed a menu, the staff sarcastically said \"" really? you need a menu \"" \nAs we drove up he approached us and we just wanted some chili dogs. The drive up speaker was not functioning, they had these staff people walking from car to car taking orders, then another person radioed them in, another person took your money, then the finally staff person gave you the food. \nWe arrived at 2pm, it was 2:35 by the time we were one car behind the pay window, at this point we were so frustrated we left the line and headed somewhere else to eat. \n\nOh well",1
"Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.\n\nI have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered \""Traditional Vegetarian\"", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the \""Traditional Vegetarian\"". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.\n\nPlease, if you want pizza, do not come here.",0
The lunch buffet is a little over priced for me... Both times I went the food items I wanted were either gone or nearly so and not replaced while I was there. As for the food there is much better fare to be had even buffet (and I hear the by the order rather than the buffet is better). Overall a slight disappointment.,1
"This is by far the worst meal my wife and I have ever had. From the start we were ignored, and a table of 6 were served there drinks and starters before us, and the staff had to be reminded twice. The starter was clearly not what we ordered and despite our complaint, the main meals were served quickly upon us. as for the main meals, my wife's pasta contained the most grissly fattiest ham you can imagine, making her pasta inedible. As far as my main meal was concerned, it was supposed to be Lasagne, but in fact turned out to be a congealed piece of meat and cheese which had just come out of a microwave, ohh and it was served cold. let's not forget the side salad which clearly the Manager seemed to. All in all a truly unpleasant experience, and in fact the Worst meal we have experienced. So much so that we refused to pay the full amount of the bill. the managers response was to lock us and all the other diners in the restauraunt for 1/2 hour awaiting Police arrival at the premises, Upon Police arriving the manager was rightly told that this was a civil matter and he was not allowed to lock us in the premises. A truly unpleasant experience!! If I could give minus stars I would. \""",0
"Having frequented Pin Kaow a few times and enjoy the pad Thai I suggested this place for an early dinner. It was 5pm on a Saturday and there was only one other table (appox 5 people). The hostess came right up and greeted us and sat us at a booth. Then we waited... And waited... And waited. My boyfriend could see servers walking by yet no one came over. After sitting there for at least 10 minutes, we saw another couple walk in. The hostess immediately greeted them. Extremely frustrated, we walked out.  It is a shame, the food is good but the service was ridiculous!",1
"My wife and I went to this show on 12/27/09.  When I bought the tickets, I did not know it was a preview show.  I just thought I was lucky to be able to buy tickets to this show so close to their grand opening.\n\nI am now starting to realize that Cirque shows are definitely departing from the style of shows like Mystere or O.  Instead, they are moving towards dances, themes, costumes, the set, and the occasional acrobatic stunts that take your breath away.  Viva Elvis is definitely trying to appeal to the Elvis fan.  The set was quite nice and the costumes were outstanding.  I learnt a few things about Elvis that I didn't know before.  Their rendition of his songs were good and bad.  It really depends on the singer.\n\nOverall, I just wasn't wowed by the show like I was in O, Mystere, and even Ka.  I guess I'm just not their target audience.  The choreography during the show wasn't that great either and a few of the dancers were definitely in the wrong place.  However, I chalk them up to just the lack of practice during a preview show.  Overall, 3 stars in my book.",2
Probably deserves more of a 3.5 rating. \n\nThe food was generally really good but because of my fabulous steak dinner at the palms the night before I wasn't as impressed as I should have been. The sushi was tasty but not the best I've had (especially at this price range). My favorite thing was the udon soup which was subtly flavorful but considering how many other things we ordered - this shouldn't be my favorite dish of the night.\n\nA beautiful restaurant but the service was a bit slow for us and despite having over 2 hours to dine there we ended up rushing our meal and skipping ordering further and jumping to the McDonalds to fill us up pre-Vegas drinking.,2
"I really like the layout for this store.  The display the greets you as you walk through the doors is always pretty extravagant with various colors and new designs.  It's like a pile of x-mas presents laid out before you, except they're all open and with large price tags on them.  They definitely made this one more hip compared to locations that are well established.\n\nEverything in this store is spread out into small sections.  The accessories, luggage, and men's sections are all fairly small, and the selection on display is slim.  They do however carry a lot of models that aren't on display, you just have to know what you're looking for and ask.\n\nThe staff has been a hit or miss here.  The first few times it was pretty bad as they ignored me and kept looking at me as someone that couldn't afford any of the stuff in the store.  Then there was another time when Rita helped me out and she was super nice and I wound up making a purchase there (granted she was hot too and I kind of got suckered in, but it was worth it).",2
"The room was very nice, but we arrived very late (early) because of a storm and waited 20 minutes in line to check in. It appeared they had 5 people on the desk at the time (on a Friday night...) then all weekend had to wait no less than 15 minutes for elevators that were almost all packed to capacity. We had a very difficult time getting to and from our room. The people we encountered in every elevator lobby area were extremely frustrated.\n\nAlso, we were approached by a lady (in the mall there) that asked if we would like to register for a free stay another time as some kind of promotion. I did not ask for the particulars. When I explained that we have a very busy travel year and Vegas was not in our plans again this year, she became very rude. Literally gave us a rude look and let us know that we had wasted her time. An interesting response to something we had only stopped for at her request. I want to say her name was Edith?\n\nEvery other employee in the hotel seemed very nice and breakfast in the Cafe was fantastic.",1
"Vasili'sTake Five recently opened up on Willy street right across from where I work.  I wanted to like this place because I love Greek Food, but the experience was really very average.\n\nThe service I received from my waitress was friendly and prompt.  She got us menus and water right away. \n\nThe decor is modern and clean.  I really liked the granite tables.\n\nMy dining companion and I ordered a sampler platter of appetizers.  While the cheese pie came out piping hot, I suspect it was premade/frozen and heated to order.  There was really nothing special about it.  Spanikopita or spinach pies were the same story.  The stuffed grape leaves were most certainly from a can.  They were really quite terrible.  I love stuffed grape leaves.  These were awful.  Seriously, I went to a restaurant so you could open a can and dump crap on a plate?\n\nEgg plant hummus was an interesting take on hummus, but they are definitely using canned garbanzo beans, and it didn't really wow me.  It was unusual and different, but not awesome tasting.  I'd rather have an amazing plain hummus than a wild/crazy hummus that is just OK.  \n\nStaff loudly yelling and chatting behind the bar in the other room detracted from the ambiance.  The music selection also seemed a little odd, and was way too loud for a dining room that was largely empty.  \n\nI ordered my salad \""light on the dressing\"".  Instead, they put the dressing on the side.  This is a major pet peeve of mine in restaurants.  I hate tossing the salad on the plate because it's difficult to do and makes a mess.  If I wanted dressing on the side, I would have asked for dressing on the side.  It also cost extra to have chicken on top  and then they gave me a miniscule portion of chicken.  It was probably 3 ounces of chicken.  The salad itself wasn't very generously proportioned and so I actually left hungry after dropping almost $20 on dinner.  \n\nA few weeks prior to this visit, I had a chicken pita to go, was good, but overpriced.  The moussaka that my friend had, which I tried a bite of, was very good tasting.  \n\nOverall, save your money and go somewhere else because this restaurant just isn't firing on all cylinders.  There are too many great restaurants in the Willy street neighborhood to waste your money here.",1
"I was craving late night sushi a few months ago and hopped on yelp to hopefully find a place.and this is how I tried this spot. Walked in and was surprised this place was so busy but was excited since that usually means its good. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I was greeted by 3 very friendly sushi chefs. This is the reason I keep coming back. The sushi chefs are always inviting and will help you with any questions you have!they are awesome! The sushi quality is pretty good as well!always super fresh tasting and so much variety!now for the reasons I give only 3 stars. the first time I dined there, I was charge $2.75 for soda WATER....that's just tap water with bubbles.never in my 12 years of being in the service industry have I ever Been charged or charged a Customer for tap water with some C02. When I asked the manager he had no explanation for me and said \""yeah it's just like that and there's a charged for it.\"" Now if I was the manager of a nice sushi Resturant I would respond with \""yes ma'm there is a charge for water with bubbles here but since it's your first time and you didn't know I would be happy to make an exception and remove it off your bill this time\"" whatever dude my bellys fool of delicious sushi. and I'm not in the mood to end my night poorly over some bubbles.....I'll just order regular tap next time....last thing is I've been to this place at least 4 times now and only last night was I asked if I had an AYCE stamp card....ummm no I don't because I was never asked in the first place....the servers need to communicate with eachother more and I think the manager needs some tips on hospitality.....",2
"Wow haven't been to a place that messed up this bad EVER! First off we were asked which size beer we wanted 16 oz and we were given the 20 oz. Next up my husband ordered a \""Louie Burger with tots\"" there are 3 different Louie burgers on the menu. Can anyone else see a potential problem here? Well guess what they didn't get us the wrong Louie Burger they gave us a portobello burger and it is called a Portobello Burger on the menu.  Needless to say he also was given fries.  We clarified we needed a fried burger with egg and tots. Drumroll ... This time we get a different Louie Burger with onions and still no egg or bacon.  To top this off I had ordered the chicken tacos (which were awesome), however the rice and black beans were totally cold. We refused to pay for any of the burgers and I told them about the rice and beans but they only took off the burger. Our total out the door was $40 bucks and we aren't planning to return.  Which is really a shame as I have been 3 previous times and loved it.  The last time being the day before I got married with family and friends.  Talk about ruining a great thing and memory.",0
"First off I would just like to say that Safeway is my favorite grocery store. Some say that it is pricey but quality is what matters most in my family. Ok so this Safeway has NO ethnic hair or skin products. However, this is not true for other Safeway's that I have been to (and Walmart's and Fry's for that matter). This is in a pretty diverse area of town! White's, Blacks, Hispanics and Asians alike! This may not matter to most people but when you go to a market you'd expect them to be open to the things you need. Also, the bathrooms are dirty and a cashier named Wanda was just plain crabby. I drove to another Safeway and got my hair pomade as normal. I won't be returning to this store.",1
"My wife and I went here Tuesday night for dinner with a plan to come a bit early, sit at the bar, and enjoy some happy hour cocktails.  Our plan was thwarted when we realized this place was some sort of cougar gathering place.  The bar was packed with little hope of somebody getting up.  So, we just took a seat in the main dining area without a wait.\n\nAnyway, everything to say about this place has already been said on here.  I expected much more because of the location but it really was just an upscale Olive Garden that charges triple.\n\nThe Gorgonzola Lamb Chops appetizer was great and so was the Bistecca Insalata.  I should have just stopped there and let that be my dinner.  Instead, for an entree, I ordered the Garganelli Carbonara which was waaaay too creamy, oversauced and under-flavorful.  It was not advertised like that on the menu.  Almost everything else on the menu sounds good but I doubt the stuff tastes as good as it looks.  My wife had some sort of shrimp dish that looked excellent but was way to salty and no doubt contained frozen shrimp.\n\nThe service was very good but I probably won't be back.  I almost never have pasta so when I do splurge I want it to be delicious and the stuff here is just blah.",2
"Customer Service... what's that? This place has no clue. Rude, and outright mean. They had nothing nice to say about anything or anyone in the store. I would rather drive miles out of my way than ever set foot in this place again. If you must use UPS to ship something there are many other locations that will treat you like a customer, not an annoyance. \n\nIf it matters I was shipping a RMA Computer Hard Drive. The guy at the counter was rather upset that I had the nerve to ask for some tape to seal the box and attach the pre-paid label. His justification was that his store saw no profit from people using pre-paid labels that are bought online and printed out. The tape costs $3.00 a roll. That is a 200ft roll.. So the 8\"" that I needed set him back about $.13. His attitude forever lost him a customer. I ship things such as this 4-9 times a year. Never will another item be sent from this location.",0
"Well.....what to say ....\n\nWe got a deal on Itison for two hotdogs and a half pint of Innis and Gunn or a glass for wine for \u00a39. Good deal! \nSmaller than I thought, we had reserved a table and when I arrived people were already sitting there, which was no problem as i was early. My partner arrived and we sat at another table until ours became free, we would have just sat at the other table for the duration but the door was opening continually and a very cold breeze would catch you and so we waitied on the table further away from the door. Id imagine that this pub isnt all that warm most of the time and I am a total girl and need heat in this weather. We ordered two chilli dogs and they arrived with fries in a wooden box, nice touch, The cocktails here are only \u00a36.95...so yes i ordered a Margarita! was pretty poor to be honest! The hotdog meal was okay and I dont think i would have paid full price for the meal. Beer selection was okay but i have been in pubs with a much better selection. \nI go the impression that Jeremiah is trying to be the next Hanging Bat, but just not at good as!",2
"They hire nothing but unskilled assholes at this location. One time I came in to buy a Gatorade and a news magazine, from the moment I came in they were rude, they were following me everywhere I went in the store as if I was going to steal something, and when I was looking for the gatorades I accidentally stumbled upon the alcohol section and got yelled at by one of the employees that I'm not old enough to be there and I shouldn't be anywhere near there even though I didn't even go into the alcohol section and I was just looking for the gatorades. On top of that, when I went to pay for the magazine and Gatorade, while they had an employee stalking my every move to see that I didn't steal anything, the cashier was extremely rude to me talking to me with an angry voice and even overcharging me for the Gatorade leading me to only getting the magazine instead. Overall, all the employees were rude to me and all of them were profiling me from the start. And then another time I went in, months later, I went in to pay for something and I was wearing my \""register to vote with me\"" button because I had been doing voter registration earlier, and the cashier was extremely rude not wanting to attend me and even telling me that she doesn't vote and she thinks voting is dumb and whoever votes is dumb like me. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST AT THIS LOCATION, DO NOT GO THERE.",0
we saw this place while shopping next door at the Indian market.  I was excited to see a Mexican restaurant that was going to be differant.  When we sat down and looked at the menu the only thing that looked interesting was the Indian taco.  so we got that and nachos.  Every thing was good but nothing was speacial or different from any other mexican place.,1
"RED LOBSTERS NEW CLAIM TO FAME IS THEY HAVE FISH EXPERTS ON HAND TO FIX YOUR FOOD. LMAO REALLY BECAUSE THEY SO CALLED EXPERT CANT FRY FISH AS COMMON AS CAT....THAT'S CATFISH \nThe staff are nice and they are updating their look. But they need to hire better cooks. I think they may have a pastry chef cooking fish. Because that's just what I ordered. Lord why me? That's all I was busy thinking all that night. The fish was taken back 4 times. Couples ate and left and they still brung me half done catfish. So, they cooked it 4 times and its still not done. It's catfish my god daughter who is 8 can fry catfish.\nEverything was perfect but the catfish. It makes me ponder how many chefs does it take to cook catfish at Red Lobster? It's fried catfish people. UGH! Anyway I will return and give them another chance to please me. However I will order chicken or some other dish. Red Lobster has made me a little angry because I cut the fish into 3 and they just kept re-frying the same 3 fish its like hello can someone get a clue and send new catfish to the table. So the manager took it off my ticket. On the way out I took a picture of the Lobsters inside the tank and went home. Yes they told me they was sorry a million times. I am to I'm sorry I had to look at uneatable fish and could not have a nice dinner with my husband.",1
"Came here hoping to find egg custard tarts, and even though I found them they did not curb my craving.  I was not a fan of the tart shell used and found the glaze of sorts on the top of them to be superfluous and too sweet. \n\nTried a custard bun that was truly delicious and is enough to make me go back and to try more of the baked goods.",2
"A very mixed bag.  The prices are inflated for merchandise that frequently seems to be \""seconds\"".  There are some great buys, but that's only for items on \""sale\"", and by using one of their 20/40/50% coupons.  Cute home accessories, but again, prices are cheaper for similar stuff at other stores. Big selection of shoes...but way overpriced. Lingerie & costume jewelry selections are plentiful & pricing is good. Salespeople, when they can be found (almost never), are abrupt, bordering on rude (especially the ones who've worked there awhile!).  Cashiers also are not the warmest folks..and seem  unwilling to help.",1
"i like this place, but not the hordes of pigeons that live on the roof, signage, and ledges of this plaza. i dunno if i want to come here to eat anymore. theres so much pigeon shit its overflowing to the sidewalk in some areas. isnt there a health code violation for this somewhere?",2
"stayed at Cosmopolitan a couple months ago, decided to try this place for brunch.\n\nmeh, just your average Vegas buffet. nothing special, nothing bad. Not much to say about this place either, had the typical variety of meats and seafood.\n\nprobably wouldn't come back here unless we stay here again and it's convenient.",2
"Ghettooooo. This is the type of store where they have the Tide on lock down and anything you might be able to make meth out of only sold in limited quantities. \n\nThe customer base is a blend of tweakers, unplanned pregnancies and foreign exchange students who have a look of, \""I left Finland for this?\"" on their faces. \n\nI almost bought some neckbones (I'm black don't judge me) but there was so much blood in the pkg I was afraid I'd find a severed hand in there when I got home. #pass \n\nI'm not even sure how I ended up here. Oh yeah. The dairy is on 3 separate places. Seriously. Aisle 4, the back wall and in one of those open fridge things where there's also 10 for $10 fish filets from fish you've never heard of from Paraguay (which I think is a landlocked Nazi haven. I could be mistaken).\n\nAnyway avoid unless this is where your meet your dealer.",0
It's great that they have an all day happy hour but that is pretty much it. They take sushi to a whole new low... By totally bastardizing it and making it appealing to the average 'American' who is afraid of eating anything that is raw and is not covered with a sweet or tangy sauce. Pearl deep fries everything!! And covers their rolls with sauce after sauce. Go to Pearl for drinks but don't go there to eat.,1
"Nothing special.  The food was good but not spectacular.  The service was good as well, however, when we ordered dessert, we also ordered a cappuccino which never made it to the table.\n\nHOST\nWe arrive late last night (10pm) to be seated.  The host was busy talking on his mobile which took a few minutes.  No biggie, it must have been important.  He apologized and sat us at a booth.\n\nAMBIENCE\nDark, a tad loud with the casino's music, rock star'ish, and a lot of decorative faux cowhide items.  Sort of kitschy, imo.\n\nFOOD\nWe were asked what type of water we preferred (table) and were served preztel rolls w/mustard butter immediately.  They were actually pretty good.  \n\nFor appetizers, the bf ordered the seafood platter which included a king crab leg, oysters, lobster tail, and some shrimp; I ordered the mini mini 3 which includes three half-dollar sized grilled cheese bites, a tea mug of tomato, and another mug of corn chowder.  Since I'm the only azn in the world who doesn't eat seafood I cannot rate his dish.  My dish was aok.\n\nFor entrees, the bf orders scallops over lobster mashed potatoes (or taters as he calls 'em).  He notes the scallops were cooked perfectly and were divine.  I ordered the usual, a 6oz. filet mignon, medium well.  The steak was tender and seasoned well but, perhaps not the best cut of filet--it looked like one of the end pieces.  When it first came out, I almost thought they brought out a sirloin.  As soon as I cut into it and tasted it, I realized it was indeed filet.\n\nThe bf and I noticed that none of the tables had salt and pepper shakers.  Luckily, we didn't need them because everything we ordered was seasoned well.\n\nAnd of course dessert.  We ordered the creme brulee which comes in a trio of caramel, chocolate, and (traditional) vanilla.  The caramel and chocolate almost seemed like puddings with a caramelized sugar crust.  The vanilla was a traditional custard.  Don't get me wrong the dessert trio was still delicious.  Like I mentioned above, the server forgot to bring out the bf's cappuccino :(.  \n\nCONCLUSION\nIt was a good meal but not worth the prices. I would say the steak quality was that of Outback Steakhouse's (the one at Casino Royale), however the bf thought the seafood was tasty and too small of portions.  Our grand total was $122.  Luckily, we had a $65 comp.  I can't see us returning unless we were given another comp.  I'd rather go to Veloce Cibo at the M Resort for the same price.",2
"10$ Friday night Cosmic bowling includes 2 hours of bowling, shoe rental, and a raffle ticket for prizes given throughout the night (starts at 10pm!). The facility is a little old but I do like how each lane has its own TV and table. The snack bar is very iffy but they do have $1 refills which is good. Bottom line is, if you want a cheap date night or friends night out bowling with unpretentious people this is the place to go. No thrills and frills like Lucky Strike or Brunswick XL in Gilbert but it's still tons of fun.",2
"Ok, I admit it. Ever since Hana Japanese Eatery opened up near me I have become a sushi snob.\nBut, we had been to Ninja a couple times before and it wasn't bad. They are reasonably priced and have specials. The staff is nice and friendly, decent atmosphere, fairly intimate and dark, a little loud sometimes, but ok.\nSo we were ok with it when our friends invited us out to Ninja for dinner.\nThey say the third time is the charm.  Well, this time it wasn't.\nThe sushi was bland with a lot of rice. Too much rice. It was just about all you could taste. Mussel, calamari, tuna, etc., it almost all tasted the same. I had a hard time getting my mouth around some of the pieces. The rolls, too, we are rice, with about a third of the center being the ingredients. \nBefore Ninja was not bad. But this time it was.",1
"I saw Nathan Burton's show back when it was at the V Theater at Planet Hollywood.  Not bad for newcomer magician.  He was very entertaining and got the audience involved.  I have to admit that he connected to the audience a lot better than David Copperfield.  That's saying a lot since Copperfield is the seasoned veteran.  \n\nBest part was that I bought my general admission ticket for his show at a Tix4Tonite booth for $25 ($40 reg price) and then when I showed up to the V Theater, I upgraded to VIP seating for $10 more.  Good deal!",2
"Folks...lets get real. Its a chinese buffet. You get to pig out until you explode for less than 10 bucks. We all go into these places knowing its not gourmet. And we are all generally amused that they have options like pudding, enchiladas, mac n cheese and garlic bread. If your ideal evening is eating yourself into a coma and having explosive gas for about a day....Red Wok will do the trick.",2
"You can tell a lot about the meal you are about to eat by the quality of the salad. I ordered a relatively basic chicken parmigiana sandwich a side salad. What I expected was iceberg lettuce and an unripe cherry tomato. What I got was a nice mix of salad greens, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese and croutons. Impressed - for a side salad in a bar, not bad.\n\nWe also ordered the fish and chips. Well done, nice pieces of cod lightly battered and fresh.  Coleslaw was of the creamy style, the kind I like. Can't stand dry slaw.\n\nBlue Moon on tap, $7.25 for 25 ounces, not bad. \n\nWe had nice food server, didn't sit at the bar so can't comment on the bartenders. \nOur server was telling us they do some sort of theme night every now and then, a dress up kind of thing. \n\nNice lounge area near the front, several couches and tables and a few tv's. There's a wall of 6 large screen LCD tv, good place to watch some games.\n\nOverall a decent place, would definitely go back. I takes a few good visits to become a 'fan' so it gets 3 stars for now.",2
"Went in with a group that paid for bottle service, I am the lone black dude in our crew, @ about 4 I went back to our table which was vacant @ the time (most of the crew had left). Manager comes up and tells me the table is reserved and proceeds to kick me out for sitting @ my table!\n\nI'm a 15 year clubbing veteran and this was the first time I'd ever been kicked out.\n\nFirst time for everything I guess...:(",0
"Went into the location and waited minutes for someone to appear to ask us for our order and even after we said Hello they didn't acknowledge us. Had to repeat order several times. It was very frustrating how nothing seemed to be in stock, no philly cheese steak nor soup was available. I heard someone as I was leaving being told some type of bread wasn't available (which is actually understandable, condiments and bread sometimes run out or need to be retrieved/baked). \n\nFelt like we were being rushed and just didn't feel like a clean place. Will not go back.",0
"I'll be honest, it wasn't the best place I've ever been! I found the decor inside and out a bit garish, the food a bit bland and the staff a bit miserable, the highlight of my experience was the huge fish in the fish tank! \nI don't think I'll be returning any time soon, Sorry for the negative comment but it was a big disappointment for me.",2
"Came to the Spice Market Buffet for dinner using our buffet of buffets pass. Sadly it was not very good. There is a large variety of food types, but unfortunately most aren't worth trying. The Mexican station was the best, but even that wasn't great it was just far better than everything else! \n\nOn a positive note the line moved very fast and we waited for less than 10 minutes.\n\nIf you have the buffet of buffet pass save yourself the stomach space and go to the Paris buffet instead.",1
"I just might be a little bit parshall to the willow house. I hung out there when i was in high school and even after 8 years i still love it. The atmoshere and makes up for where its lacking in taste.

If you want amazing coffee, i'd pass.",2
"Terrible service, horrid sliders, waiter couldn't answer simple question asked regarding \""what sides come with sliders\"", had to wait for diet coke as the keg had to be changed, gave waiter our order prior to 5:30p for early bird prices however I watched him take a good 8 mins to enter it in the computer.  Another waiter waited to enter his order and finally walked away.  Our waiter had no people skills, no knowledge, and moved at a turtle's pace.  No condiments on sliders, no garnish and I was not even offered any.  The restaurant was so cold that I put a napkin over my fries to try and keep them warm......didn't work.  Horrid experience!",0
"Wando's is...alright.  There is usually at least some people there, even on a weeknight, which is good if you happen to have the luxury of making it out on a monday or sunday night.  The drinks aren't spectacular-I don't think the fishbowl is all that spectacular.  The bar itself is pretty nicely laid out-it is three levels with a little bit of a different atmosphere on each level.\n\nThe reason why I've never been a big fan of Wando's is the crowd.  The people are extremely uninteresting.  You have your typical 24 year old dudes going out with a group of guys, thinking they are the coolest thing to ever happen to this city/bar, trying to get as hammered as possible-and you've got your 20 year old sorority/sorority-type girls who can't seem to help but falling in love with their every words as well.  You also have the madison grads who come back to relive the days of their youth - who really haven't found anything better to do since.  If I could meet cooler people at this bar, I would definitely like it alot more.  As it is-if you are a madison student, you need to come here when you turn 21 to get the fabled \""fishbowl,\"" but after that there are plenty of other better choices in Madison if you want a fun night.",1
"awful.  even for a stranded, hungry airport captive.\n\nordered the steak thai wrap.  3 bites into it, had to toss it. Still, stayed with me for 4 very uncomfortable hours. Who knows what I ingested but it was not something humans should consume--even on a bet.\n\nhold your appetite for a joint that won't make you regret what you eat.",0
"Okay so not to be critical but they make salads. Are they really good salads? I would say they are good. Mind blowing not sure about that, \n\nA couple things I liked. If you add a meat of some kind they grill it up fresh and that is great. I got salmon one day and it was very tasty. The ingredients are fresh as well and hey since it's a salad that's pretty important.\n\nWhere they fall short is the lettuce is not chopped up enough and so you are stuck trying to cut up these giant lettuce leaves with a flimsy plastic knife and fork. Not site where their lettuce comes from but it's like something out of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. Serious salad monsters. \n\nSecond the people making the salads are what I can only describe as intense. I realize they are busy and in a hurry but as the joker would ask - why so glum? It just isn't a good vibe. I mean sorry your store is way too small for the hordes of people that try to jam in there but not really my issue.\n\nThat brings us to number three. The place is small. Too small for the crowds they get. Hopefully they are going to move into the old Quiznos location a couple doors down. I mean seriously they almost need crowd control. If you like cozy well you'll really like it. No place to sit it is to go only.\n\nSo would I go there again. After three visits I'm going to have to say no. Line is too long, the person on the grill is always behind, and well I want my lunch from people who can take 5 seconds to smile and be thankful that I'm supporting their business.\n\nSo summary. Salads are good as long as you are okay with a few quirks. I'll wave at you when you're in line while I head down to metropolitan or Valhalla. \n\nEnjoy.",2
"Came in to have lunch by myself.. Stood by the door for a few min waiting to get seated. The staff just looked at me and didn't even acknowledge me. I had to walk up to someone and ask if she was seating people and she replies back \""sorry, I didn't see you.\"" I made eye contact with her twice, and on top of that I was wearing bright mint colored pants.. lol! I can't stand horrible service like this, I walked out.",0
"I am reading through these reviews and wonder if we went to a different Lidia's Pittsburgh, because on our romantic Valentine's Day the Olive Garden would have been more fresh and authentic (p.s. it's neither of those things). My husband and I loved her cooking show and figured that her restaurant would be something we would like to try, boy were we way off. Maybe it was our fault for choosing a holiday but it was their fault for cutting corners, in the worst way possible, FLASH FROZEN FOODS!  They had a fixed menu with some options, but we already knew we were going to be charged $48 per person, which was pretty pricey, but maybe it was worth it, well it wasn't. First course was a fried ball that apparently had lobster in it, all you could taste is how much work the fryer had put in for the day, and it was a lot. Second course, couldn't wait, Caesar salad and a dish with shrimp and spaghetti squash,  salad was ok, the shrimp you couldn't taste because they were the little frozen ones that are cute when breaded but when they aren't they just look sad, as if they had never been in the sea (which I am banking these hadn't).  Then finally main entr\u00e9e, we held out hope thinking we there could still be a chance, again the price was $48 PER PERSON! My husband had gotten the tuna, JOKE, this made me maddest of all, it was pescado without the pescado part. We could have dealt with a small piece of FRESH tuna, but seeing as how this was an average piece of flash frozen crap with the grill marks already on it, thank goodness those poor chefs didn't have to actually grill a piece of fish. My pasta trio dish was ok, nothing about it screamed high and or fresh quality foods.  The worst part was that the service was excellent other than he could see on our faces we wanted nothing to do with the food, so he never asked how it was, but he was fantastic. So after the frozen crappy desert or finger food, that was horrid, we got our bill all said and done with a glass of wine, cappuccino, tax and tip, we paid $150.00! So save your money and go to spaghetti warehouse at least you know what you're getting.  Lidia, YOU OWE US MONEY!",1
"I ordered from Mama DePalma's on the recommendation of a friend, as I'm new to Henderson and wasn't sure where to go. The staff member who answered the phone was very helpful and the gentleman who delivered it was kind.\n       My only disappointment is that my pizza was lukewarm upon arrival. It was disappointing because the wait had been quite long and we were all hungry when it came. \n       Judging from the wonderful reviews here on yelp, I'd be more than open to going into the restaurant and trying it out, but I don't plan on paying for cold delivery from this particular establishment again.",2
"Certified Appliance Service or Repair is actually  JONES APPLIANCE SERVICE. DO NOT DO NO NO NOT CALL THEM UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF. When I asked why my bill was so HIGH he said it included a $100 Google advertising fee..  yes that's right, He padded my bill by $100 to cover his google bill.

"We came here with a party of 15 people for a birthday. It was a tuesday, so it was almost empty for this GIANT bar with a stage, and the performers were starting to get set up.\n\nI was ordering the food from a kind older waitress who was jottings things down on a napkin when I told her that my boyfriend and I were going to be on the same check. \n\n\""We don't do that here\"".\n\nOkay, thats fine. I'll assumed I could take my receipt and his, and just pay for both. I mean, there's no way they were going to lump 25 people on the same bill, right? I mean.. we had like 10 couples and a bunch of kids. I got the food, which was okay, said happy birthday, and wanted to head out after being there for an hour or two. \n\nI got my waitress, who seemed a bit over her head, and calmly asked for my bill so I could leave. She gave me a menu and said \""Figure it out for yourself\"". \n\nWhat. The. Hell. \n\nFigure it out for myself? What was the point of a register? Do I look like an accountant? What are City of Scottsdale taxes here, anyway? Are we on a barter system? Why do I even have to pay anything at this point, if it is some free-for-all where I tell you how much my food was and you maybe/maybe not charge me?! Seriously.\n\nI stood there, trying to talked to here, for 10 minutes and she just ignored me. Like in a bad movie, I was standing there, making eye contact, while another person who was supposed to be my server pretended I didn't even exist. Unbelievable. I was so furious, I almost lost it. I calculated it out, even though the cost of the drinks wasn't on the menu, and left. BAH!",0
"This is a 2 diamonds hotel? REALLY? I mean the fountain is great, the casino seems pretty sleek too but you don't need to be staying in the hotel to experience those right?\n\nThe room is decent sized but I got really annoyed today. After a long day of work I went back to my room to rest. And for me there's nothing better than a cup of warm tea. Couldn't find an electrical kettle. Nowhere to get any hot water either (I'm not used to drinking from tap) I thought this is basic???\n\nSo I called the front desk and the girl kept pushing me to talk to the in room dining who btw wants to charge me $4 for a cup of hot water. SERIOUSLY? The people were rude and at this point it's beyond that stupid hot water. \n\nStrange.. What is wrong with these people, she ended the conversation with \""it's been OUR policy for 13 years\"" errrr maybe you should be less snobbish and try to say it nicer or something?\n\nOh btw they don't even have room slippers and toothbrush in their room, you have to request for those. Isn't this also basic basic basic hotel things? Are they trying to cut cost that MUCH?\n\nHonestly I don't care much for the Bellagio, there are other nice newer hotels in Vegas. For my next trip I'll definitely look elsewhere. I'll probably swing by Mon Ami Gabi for dinner and shamelessly free ride on the fountain but you ain't getting a single penny from me hmmm~",1
"I wasn't going to say anything, but after another person mentioned it, thought I would just throw it out there.  I'm sure many people received the same email inviting you to attend the opening this past Sunday.  Based on the email, we were expecting to be \""treated\"" to their food.  Upon arrival, we found out it was a paying event.  I think this was a ploy by the owners to \""bait and switch\"" loyal LGO customers.  After looking at the limited menu, we decided to go elsewhere.  I was fairly disappointed at the antics used to lure customers to their opening.",0
"At one point in my life I played in a band, a full time traveling band. We've stayed in some of the shadiest places in town, and this would qualify. Let's put it this way, I slept with clothes on because I didn't want to touch the sheets. So, why did I stay here? Because it was a business trip, and I really had no choice. \n\nOn the plus side, it's within walking distance (2 minutes) of the EXPO center.",0
"I have been here a handful of times for gel manicure and pedicure. The first couple of times they did what I would consider a pretty good job. I also liked that they were able to get me out of there  with both  gel mani and pedi pretty quick. So even though their work was only pretty good I kept going back because I knew they got the job done quick. \n\nAlthough, I soon realized I wasn't saving any time after all. I was having to go back and get my manicure redone after 10 days, and 10 days was pushing it, my nails chipped and tore so fast! The gel manicures do not last. The last couple times I was there their work wasn't even pretty good anymore. I had bumps and bubbles in my manicure. I asked the lady to fix it, she didn't see anything wrong. I had to point out the mistakes over and over again to get her to fix it. Finally, she did begrudgingly fix it. \n\nI don't plan on going back to Magen Nail.

"Rollier's is exactly everything that I can remember about the local hardware store when I was growing up. I'm certain that they have someone named \""Chuck\"" that knows the answer to any of your household projects. This place has a wide variety of items that you can use to complete most of your home projects but it is not all encompassing. \n\nFor the most part their prices are right on point maybe a little on the high side but I figure that since most of the people there can find someone who can give you some real advice on your home project it is worth the slight mark-up. Although I have been mostly satisfied with Rollier's I have had a number of less than desirable experiences ranging from rudeness to being outright ripped off. Example I was sold a sink faucet spray hose that was not new, matter of fact it was so used that there was calcium deposits on it. The sink hose adapter didn't fit my sink so I had to run over to Lowe's to buy the correct fit. When I attempted to return it Rollier's accused me of using it! What I just bought this, how the heck could calcium deposits develop in under a week. And then the store manager had the nerve to ask me why I waited a week to return the faucet. Dude I travel for my job I was out of town for 4 nights. I have been back a few times since but I have hard feelings every time I bust out some cash for a purchase.\n\nAfter writing this review I think I will go to Lowe's again and just fumble through projects with advice from someone who knows little about home improvement projects. At least you can return purchases that are wrong without an inquisition!",2
"If you're at this resort and have no means of getting into town, this isn't all that bad. Service is good and food is well prepared, but with all the other options in Scottsdale, why settle? There was actually a live Jazz singer in the lounge who was quite good, so, overall, I had a positive experience here.\n\nOne thing this place is great for is group dinners. We had a fairly small group of 6, but saw others with 10-12 in their parties sitting around long tables to accommodate.",2
"Traveled to Vegas to see Rod Stewart on our 16th Wedding anniversary. \nRod Stewart was playing at Caesar's Palace, this hotel is close by. \nThe room was ok but old, the long walks thru the casino to get anywhere was full of smoke from smokers. \nWe asked the clerk at the checkin counter where there was a fine dining restaurant, she advised the Cortez Room, there at the Gold Coast Hotel. \nThe meal at the Cortez Room was hands down is the worst meal we have ever had in Las Vegas in the 35 years traveling there. We had to send ever item back, change our order, because we could not eat what was being served, The menu it self was very old fashioned, nothing healthy. The staff just kept taking it back. \nWe observed numerous tables doing the same. There was nothing served fresh, only frozen and microwaved. The manager only comped half the meal. \nWe also complained to head of the food and beverage department. \nThis manager took our phone number and said he was going to contact us the next night to make it right, but never contacted us. The price of the meal was very expensive for this horrible menu. I even got sick the following day.\nI will never stay at the Gold Coast Hotel again.\nYou can not say that you get what you pay for, because in Vegas, the bar is usually set a lot higher, for less.",0
"Two co-workers and I stopped for lunch after hitting Bass Pro. We weren't expecting much, but the decor wasn't bad overall, and the chips and salsa were quite good.\n\nAll three of our meals looked pretty tasty, but were all but flavorless. I bit into an inch-long rib bone in my chicken enchiladas. Not a great experience. Service wasn't bad, but I think there was one other table in the place.",1

"I placed an order on 10/10/14 around 9:40am,  using the Paypal (eat24) app on my phone. I been reading the reviews and some are good and some are not, so I decided to try it out. I got to the store at 10:10am and I told them I had placed an order and I was picking it up. I gave them my name and I had to wait 5 minutes, I could tell they forgot to do my order which was the Char-broiled caesar salad, because they were asking me what I wanted in it, when I had already specified online. My time for pick-up was 10:05am\n\nI waited and after 5 minutes someone from the kitchen gave me my food. I went home and when I opened the foam container, all I had was a Big Tortilla Bowl filled with bad lettuce(practically brown) up to the top and just a few pieces of tomatoes, 4 croutons and ONLY, I repeat ONLY 4 tiny strips of Chicken, they weren't like Chicken tender strips, all I had was  4 strips of chicken which looked like they pulled from the breast.  \n\nMy total was $10.11 for this salad, which I didn't mind at first, but this is pathetic. I would stick to Subway's Salads around the corner, even they have fresher lettuce.",0
"We came back to Stripsteak after enjoying it the previous time and found that the experience did not duplicate itself. This visit was the worst experience I have ever had at a Steakhouse. The hostess was rude and inattentive, we had a reservation for when they opened and they sat all the waiting families and wouldnt seat us! I had to go up and ask to be seated again. The waitress was okay but not very attentive to our table.\n\nThe fries were good of course, as was the salad and the soup, but then the main reason you go to a steakhouse, the steak, was awful! I cannot stress this enough, my ribeye steak was no better than a $10 steak I could buy at Wal-Mart, actually it might not have even been that good. Well over half the steak was inedible, it came out cold, as did all of our sides. I would have sent the steak back but I couldnt get the waitresses attention to come check on how the steak was. For what you are paying this place was not even close to worth it. Just plain awful experience. We will never go there again.",0
"This place is quite shocking. I'm giving it one extra star for the experience.  I would say it is a place meant for people who have a fetish for gluttony. You need to be really open minded coming here.  Stepped on the large scale outside and I first weighed in at 105 lbs.  walking in I could not figure out how to enter.  I attempted to walk in through the turnstyle and failed.  Finally a nurse came and dressed me in a hospital gown.  I totally felt uncomfortable because all I could think about was being in a hospital where there are germs and sickness.  (It was a Psychological discomfort). And all of a sudden we saw people getting spanked by a midget who rides around in a mini ambulance to deliver food. It looked like it was so hard and painful!!  So as we were looking at the menu we read all these rules.  I was definitely not going to submit myself to such nonsense. I have absolutely no ass to save my life!  And it was a turn off that we would get punished for not finishing our food.  Skinny bitch was def in the wrong place.  We shared a burger and I ordered a butter fat shake.  I LOVE butter and all unhealthy delicious food, this got me excited and it tasted so yumm. But I could barely drink much it was extremely rich. The way they personalize and serve shots in a prescription bottle is really cool.  What grossed me out is that I bit into a part in my burger that was cold and hard that I could not chew. It was a large enough chunk. It was definitely the insides of a cow that I probably would not want to eat.  I made it out without punishment.  I wanted to try the wine that they serve in an IV but I was much too full. Upon leaving I weighed in at 107lbs. Can't be?  2 lbs?!",1
"What a nightmare experience with this Dealership.  STAY AWAY!!!!!  They killed my credit even though we agreed they would use only one financial institution, they shopped me around to 40 different lenders what a disaster. They purposefully sell you a car with defects so that you can buy the repair/service warranty and will only start fixing the car once you have actually purchased it which is what we figured out they are doing. I wander if the warranty company knows they are being taken advantage of.",0
"I eat at one of these airport places a few times per week, and they are all basically the same. A couple of companies run all of them all over the country, so there isn't a lot of variance. That's really the business model, middle-of-the-road food to capture the middle of the market. They don't need to branch out and offer something spectacular because they have a basically captive audience. It's the airport, so most things are overpriced. Skip all the food, buy and drink some duty-free booze...at least you won't remember the pain of travel. If your company is paying, sit at the bar and down some $10 bloody marys...",2
"This is a great place to have a chill beer with friends in a really cool atmosphere. Not only does the place have good beer, but they have a full kitchen and serve up some tasty looking food. I've had the beef tartar here and can definitely vouch for it...if you're looking for a new place to try, consider Helm!",2
Ordered 2 pies to go - one wood fired and one build your own - the lady that took my order asked if I wanted fresh cracked pepper - my request never made it - $40 later - I will stick with my tried and always true pizza joints .....neither was a stand-out or reason to go back.,1
"I finally stopped here with my Yelp bestie Heather S. before I left town going to the land down under... I have passed by this joint a kazillion times. I had not even realized the name change until we were walking up to enter! Wow they are super friendly, and I thought the lead cashier, maybe shift leader who helped us place our order was yummy! \n\nI decided on the fried strips and mac and cheese, and Heather S. got the grilled chicken strips with mac and cheese.\n\nThe food is fresh and good. Really how can you go wrong with breading chicken and frying it, they do seem to make it just that much more delicious. I love the fried strips, the panko breading was fried to a perfect golden brown, mmmmm yum yes..\n\nMy only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits \""extra\"" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right? I ordered the 6 piece chicken strip meal and ran out of sauce with there limit of 3 small dipping sauce sides.\n\nAnyhow, it was good,  I just did not get the happy ending I had been hoping for...\n\nThis goes in my overrated file.... :(",2
"Amelie's is not for everyone. This place seems to always stay packed with Hipsters (with a capital H!), students, working professionals, older folks, and the most eccentrically adorned individuals you have ever witnessed. This is primarily due to its location in the North Davidson area (NoDa). The thing that keeps me coming back is the spinach soup. I never go wrong when I order it. The desserts are okay. I tried the sweet potato bread pudding and was not impressed. I think they make the mistake with it being to eggy. As a tip to the chef, leave out the egg white and only use the egg yolk. Also, I have never been served bread pudding without some kind of sweet sauce to be drizzled over it. Mine tasted rather dry and left much to be desired in the \""sweet\"" department. Unfortunately, after my third bite, I begged one of the employees for some icing or agave. She directed me to the coffee bar and suggested honey. As outrageous as that sounds, the honey made it taste better, but definitely not a winner. The creme brulee is also okay. Perhaps a lot better than the bread pudding. I have enjoyed better, but I suppose the lower price coincides with the quality. Seating is alright, outlets are reasonable. The back of the building is quieter than the front which forever has a long line. I will say, the employees do their best to make sure you are not waiting too long though. I come back because it is a place to get work done and is open a whopping 24 hours. If my local Starbucks had the same hours, that is probably where you would find me all the time.",2
"I really feel like it's my duty to warn others that if you come to this Wendy's to please bring your patience. Please don't stop here for a quick bite or if you're in a rush. The people here work at their own pace. They are all very friendly, but this area is full of retirees and quite a few of them work here. They will chat with you all day about various things, but you have to be willing to give about 10 minutes more of your time whenever you place an order. \n\nI repeat this specific Wendy's is not a \""fast\"" food joint, but my order here is always right.  :)",2
"I just had a pedicure here, the staff are less than friendly and spoke to each other in Vietnamese the whole hour I was there. The massage that was part of the pedicure was nothing more than slapping some cream on my legs and feet.  I did notice that other customers were getting a better massage. The foot bath was treated as a garbage can after my foot soak.  Staff that weren't working spent their time hunched over their phones or lap top. It was a very Unprofessional experience.",0
Unfortunately I have to drop my review down a star. I stopped in for lunch on 12/23 and they have done away w/gluten free options which is such a terrible idea being that many people suffer from celiac or gluten allergies.  The waitress said they also removed the wheat pasta for those who are health conscious. I won't be returning for that reason alone and hope that corporate will rethink their choice for removing such items.,1
"As you can tell by all the other reviews, the food is good and at times great.  The service makes you want to walk out, while waiting for your food.  I went just this past week and waited for about twenty minutes while being two of ten people who were there.  It is ridiculous.  Everytime I go, I always say I'm going to call my order ahead next time, so that I do not have to wait .  The dining area itself is a mess, and it can be a little intrusive if someone is market shopping in front of your table.  As many negatives this place has I always go back.  If your in the mood for a good sammy lunch, this is the place in old town.",2
"What a disappointment. From the outside and menu selection, La Comida showed a lot of promise. However, when the food arrived, things quickly went downhill. This restaurant is not authentic, and the food just isn't good. \n\nWe ordered queso fundido. It's basically melted cheese and extremely hard to mess up. I've eaten this appetizer a million times at a million restaurants. The only way you can ruin this is by buying the cheapest cheese that probably isn't meant to be melted. There was a think layer of grease over the cheese, and it tasted like rubber.\n\nMy tacos were okay. My margarita, which I take very seriously, was a joke and completely overpriced. That's the problem with this place. The food is mediocre and way overpriced.",1
"Been here a bunch of times. Last night was very disappointing. We had a group of about 20+ people (male and female) to celebrate 3 birthdays. Everyone got in except 1 of my male friends. He was told there was a $50-$100 cover charge because it was after 1130 when in fact we all got in after 1130. A \""manager\"" named josh and whoever was working at the door were complete jerks. Not people that should be working the front door anywhere  if you want people to return to your business.",0
"I was looking forward to eating here after reading about it online and in the newspaper, but was sadly disappointed.  Made special trip to Red Rock casino to try it out on Saturday June 28.  It was pretty empty, especially for a weekend.  My husband ordered a polish dog, and was very disappointed they don't have sauerkraut.  I originally ordered a coney dog and was disappointed they don't serve chili.  I have never heard of a hot dog place that doesn't serve sauerkraut and chili!  Anyway, I ended up ordering the dogs in a blanket.  We shared an order of fries and got two sodas, and our tab came to $27 and change, which is ridiculous for hotdogs, even in a Vegas (off Strip) casino.  I wouldn't have minded the cost if the food was as good as the Pinks (which was formerly in this location) or Nathan's, but it wasn't.  The \""blanket\"" portion of my dogs in a blanket was undercooked, and my food tasted like hot dogs wrapped in raw dough.  The fries tasted as though they  had been prepared in old grease and were limp and oily.  My husband said his polish dog was decent, yet he was still disappointed it had no kraut.  I will say the worker who delivered our food to the table was friendly, although the woman who took our order not so much.  I wish Pinks had never left this location, they were so much better!   Anyway, we feel we paid too much for subpar food and will not be back.",1
"So when someone puts a lot of subpar food on my plate it really just leads to a lot of subpar food getting thrown out.  I wish this place would focus more on quality than quantity.  I ordered the meat combo that featured ham, sausage, and bacon.  The ham was just okay, the sausage was lame, and the bacon was too hard.  The 6 pounds of hashed-browns that were under all of this meat were terrible.  The only saving grace were my eggs.  They were some of the best scrambled eggs ever.  Nothing special about them, they were just the perfect flavor, texture, and consistency.  \n\nThe service was good and the place is cute.  I enjoyed looking at the license plates on the wall and they have some train that gives out free food.  Those are good things, I think.",2
"Every friend I have in the area just RAVES about this restaurant and its sliders, but i just dont see it. I have visited this restaurant twice now, both during the week and on the weekend, and have left feeling very less than satisfied.  \n\nThe building itself is beautiful, the bar is stunning, the ambiance is lovely, (albeit incredibly loud- so dont go in there expecting to have a conversation with your dinner-mates), but the service is unimpressive.  There are certainly quite a few waiter/waitresses around (enough that i have watched them run into each other) but they never seem to come to my table.  Drinks take too long to be made as well as to reach my table from the bar.  I actually watched my drink sit at the waitress station at the bar with the ice melting in it for a while before it was brought to me.  \n\nI had the bavarian pretzels, which were decent by themselves, but the jalepeno sauce served with it was chunky and old, and had thickened to an almost inedible point.   \n\nAs for the sliders, they were nothing special, and I thought, a bit over-priced for what they were.  I wasnt thrilled about the beef the burgers were made with, and it wasnt seasoned at all.   Absolutely avoid any slider with a Turkey Burger inside, it smelled old and.....stale? rancid? \n\nThe one shining point of my visits, and the only reason this place gets a second star is because of the cheese curds.  The breading was light and crisp, the cheese had substance, and best of all, they were even delicious re-heated the next day!  The sweet potato chips are also amazing.\n\nI want to like this restaurant, but I just cant. This restaurant will never be my suggestion for a C-U dinner option.",1
"What is it about Las Vegas and its lack of good Chinese takeout? Are there cosmic Asian forces at work that keep finger-licking Kung Pao chicken or delectable broccoli beef far way from our boozy, desert collective, or are all the solid Chinese chefs locked in at proper sit-down restaurants on the Strip? \nRegardless of why the sleeping dragon of delicious Chinese takeout has never awoken in our little corner of the Mojave, I had high hopes for Chop Chop Wok.\nReading the reviews here on Yelp convinced me - dare I say - that might have finally found THE spot. You know, the kind of solid New York City-style takeout joint whose Mongolian beef melts in the mouth. Where the sweet-and-sour chicken is a stack of crunchy, honeyed bonbons of poultry goodness. Where the rice sucks you down into pillowy rivers of starch so delicious that you never want to come up for air.\nMan, did I have another thing coming.\nChop Chop Wok, unfortunately, is like a lot of neighborhood Chinese takeout joints here in Vegas: That is to say, it's run by a small coterie of smiling, accommodating folks ... who haven't the slightest idea how to turn out tasty dishes that trace their roots far back into the misty history of the Middle Kingdom.\nWhich is a shame, because the folks at Chop Chop Wok ARE friendly. They provide stellar customer service. It's just that once you get your coveted, white-paper takeout boxes home and dive inside you realize you'd have gotten closer to great Chinese takeout had you just gone to middle America's favorite, P.F. Chang's. \nWe tried a variety of dishes, but everything from the egg rolls to the crab rangoons to the beef and chicken dishes disappointed. \nWe're sorry, Chop Chop Wok. You're a bunch of truly nice people. But for those of us who've managed to find great Chinese takeout from Manhattan to the Midwest, we were hoping for so much more.",1
"Went because of Valentine's Day. Won't go again. The food was ok enough but the staff was horrible. She forgot to place an order for us three different times and we kept having to ask someone else for help. Then to find out after an hour and a half of trying to get our food correct that if we wanted an extra soda there were no refills, you had to pay again. Food was ok, but not worth everything else involved.",1
"This place has wonderful sandwiches, always does.  That is why I will continue to go there.  Went there last week to pick up a call ahead order, as I was paying, with a credit card, the kid checking me out showed me where I could tip, but \""no pressure\"" as he eyeballed each button press and was dissapointed as I chose no thank you. \n\nI understand wanting to tip if you get great service, but be serious you are a sandwich shop.  Is it necessary to have to say no thanks on a tip while checking out with a credit card??  What were they wanting 20% to hand me a bag?  Eliminate the tip option on the credit card check out screens and 5 stars on a sandwich shop.  Sandwich shop...",2
"I used to love this place. i tanned regularly for two years.... because i didn't know any better. I paid 60$ a month for a level 3 (Gold) membership. Please!!!! I found the same membership level at BB and OneStop for dang near half that price.  One one hand though, they do have a great selection of lotions, yet the computers were always down, or I was getting over charged.. yadda yadda. Go somewhere else.",1
"Stopped in to grab something and go. I think the customers were outnumbered by the employees. This place offers a wide variety of merchandise and doesn't really specialize in anything. I would liken it to the hardware section at WalMart with a little more variety. The staff was friendly enough, but I was disappointed that the store does not take debit cards, only credit which means no cash back.",2
"When I first was told we were heading to Hamadas I was really \nexcited and anticpating some tasty eats. The food was Just ok\nunfortunately.\nI ordered the seafood meal and the lobster was overcooked, which was unfortunate because he sauteed it right in front of me and even I could see that it was on the grill too long.. Oh well... \nOutside of the food the place was practically empty which was surprising because it was a Friday night...\nAll in all the entire experience was just... OK\nI think i'll keep to Benihana if I want the group/japanese grille experience !",1
"Having visited D'lish two separate times now it's safe to say I have built myself a more than fair opinion of place. It's also safe say D'lish is looking to be major hotspot of mine in the coming months! With the right mindset I know you will enjoy it here too.\n\nI would imagine many passers by give D'lish an unapologetic look. The truly lackluster curb appeal reeks with the facade of a failed and dirty restaurant. Keep in mind the word facade though. D'lish makes up for its looks in what it cooks.\n\nHealth is the focus here. Minimal portion sizes and apparently organic/natural ingredients are meant to keep even the more hearty choices at a low health concern. The burgers (what I ordered on my first visit) are meatless. Instead a wonderfully blended patty of quinoa and black beans is served between artisan bread and a slew of great tasting condiments and toppings. The \""Top Notch\"" burger is my personal favorite however many prefer the healthier option with pesto on it. Either way your taste buds will thank you!\n\nBreakfast burritos seem to be a popular item on the menu. Hence my choice in ordering one during my second visit. It's a no-frills burrito with hardly a garnish in sight, but with such high quality ingredients being cooked with careful skill and precision nothing stands in it's way to becoming the perfect breakfast meal. \n\nTry the coffee and tea too! Their dirty chai is one of the best I've ever had. \n\nTake heed, D'lish is EXPENSIVE for what you're getting. A burger is $8.50. No fries. No salad. No drink. In fact, buying a medium dirty chai tea will run you a hefty $4.75. Health is the key at D'lish, but the almost $14 price tag just does not make it plausible for a college student such as I to make frequent visits, especially if the portions are so minuscule. An unfortunate setback in an otherwise fairly perfect experience.\n\nTry it out for yourself though! Maybe the price won't bother you as much as it did me.",2
What do you have to do to get a drink in this place?  Played quarter slots for over an hour and never even saw a cocktail waitress in the area.  \n\nI liked the casino.  Everyone looked like they were having a great time....but no complimentary beverages to be found!  \n\nThey should do better.,1
"I've been to a few great brazilian steakhouses. Chima was the most expensive I've ever been to ($50 for dinner). Simply put, it's just not worth it. Compared to other steakhouses, it is definitely not the best. The meats could have been better seasoned. My favorite part about this type of steakhouse is the delicious cheese-filled bread, and here it wasn't fresh and wasn't warm, so I was very disapppointed. The salad bar is nothing special, not that I'm going for that anyway so let's move on to the meats. The lambchops were exquisite. That being said, every other single cut of meat was underwhelming. It was juicy, but not very well seasoned. And it took forever for them to bring out the specific cuts of meat requested. I was glad I got the $20 coupon for signing up on their website, but even with that it just wasn't worth the money. I will not be going back.",1
"Yeah, don't even eat here.\n\nI didn't, so why am I reviewing this place? Simply because upon inquiring about whether or not they use the highly unhealthy (and some would say toxic, or even a chronic poison) hydrogenated oils in their donuts, the answer was \""yes.\""\n\nKrispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts do this, as well, but there's no pretense at those places. Lamar's not only charges premium prices for the sub-par trans-fat riddled doughnuts they carry, but they even lie on their website, claiming: \""Our recipes have remained unchanged since 1933.\"" Sorry, folks, but I can guarantee there weren't hydrogenated oils in much of anything in the 1930s.\n\nMight as well just go to the nearest KK, DD, or QT if you're gonna eat that kind of crap; at least you'll be paying a more appropriate price for it.\n\nEDIT: I have been informed, by one courteous fellow Yelpster, that hydrogenated oils originated in the 1900s. With a bit of study, I found that Crisco, which is composed of hydro-oils, was in use in the 20s. So, perhaps they didn't lie about the recipes. However, the points about the dangers of hydrogenated oils and their ridiculous prices still stand, so *you* should \""stand\"" on the outside of their establishment.",0
"I always walked by this place and wondered if I should try.  I love middle eastern cuisine.  One day, I went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers.  The place was packed and the menu was short, which were good signs of a good restaurant.  I ordered the kibbeh and it was just disgusting.  I've had so much better elsewhere.  It was very dry and tasteless.  The only real attraction to this place is the student pricing.  Dishes here are quite cheap.  Now I see why.",0
"2.5 stars\n\nI was not impressed with breakfast here as it was quite average.. We weren't happy with the service either.. they were less professional than other restaurants/people we came across\n\nWe ordered french toast, one corned beef omelette, and two pastrami omelettes.\n\nI didn't even finish my omelette because there wasn't really anything special to it! No vegetables whatsoever.. I would have thought they woulda made it fancy somehow",1
Very sad that The owners of Wild Are taking the restaurant in a different direction... I don't believe the struggling location had a problem with the menu.. The food was great and had some nice vegan options for us to enjoy....the problem seemed to be marketing and signage. Time will tell if my my plant based eating friends and family  will be able to continue to enjoy the restaurant or not. I really hope they don't turn it into another subpar bar food restaurant.,2
"Pho is bad, taste just like what I would get if I open a bag of dried Pho and put boiling water in it. Couldn't believe how bad it tastes, and expensive too. The service wasn't good either. I think the gal who serves in front is the owner also. Man, I agree with some fellow yelpers, how did the business still manage to survive?",0
"Its my second time here and right from the start we got told by the hostess that we could not sitio at the second level, its a beautiful sunny day on a Sunday afternoon and the spot to be its up in the second floor with the view of scottsdales oldtown streets and view of the mountains, so we decided to go upstairs anyways and met Austin the bartender and took care of us.",1
Good food for the money.  Located inside the Tuscany Casino.\n\nWe ate here over the course of our three day stay while attending a convention.  Average price ranged from $7-10.   You can't go wrong.\n\nPros - plenty of seating.  Solid American food.  Cheap and plenty.\n\nCons - food served fairly lukewarm like my pancakes and corn beef hash.\n\nOpened 24 hours daily.  Lots of to go orders.,2
"Food was nowhere near as good as it was when we visited last year. Had the  chicken and waffles, both pieces of chick had the leg none still attached when we were here a year ago it was all boneless chicken. Also the chicken was dry and the breading flavorless.",2
"After reading the word of the Yelpers, I decided to stray from my Bellagio buffet to try the Wynn.  WHOOPS!\nYou guys totally let me down.  The crab was still frozen and small!! The prawns were limp!! The wasabi was more like pudding!! The rolls were unappetizing.  I could go on and on.  The only thing I liked were the pulled pork pesto sandwich, candied apples and icecream.  Still nothing special.\nForget this place hit up Bellagio's buffet.  Same price WAY better consistent quality!",1
"A strong 3 stars. Nu provides a decent, but far from overwhelming experience - in fact a slightly disappointing experience, and we got out of it with a \""meh\"" on the lips. It is good, no, better than most restaurants on Murray, but it is not as good as it should.\n\nThe restaurant itself looks fine (it shares its door with Pamela): there is enough space between tables, simple furniture, open kitchen, decent light.\n\nThe food was not overwhelming. The blintzes with meat (appetizer) were the best dish of the lunch. We  particularly enjoyed the horseradish remoulade that went with it (the highlight of the lunch imo). \n\nThe jewish penicillin with the matzo ball and pasta was quite bland, and I have had many better chicken broths. The brisket sandwich was quite tasty, although not light. \n\nPrices are fine. A complaint: they clean tables with a smelly product. Surely they know that taste and smell influence each other, and smelling cleaning product is quite unpleasant when the nearby table is being cleaned.",2
"Uh, ok, type of place. This is a sister-place of Michelangelo coffee house that's on upper State Street. So they have the same coffee, tea, pastry, and cake ... selections. I kind of liked their hot sandwich service. That is, if you prefer, you can ask them to toast their pre-made sandwich on their panini machine. I thought it was nice touch. It sort of makes up for the fact that in this town, you can't get made-to-order sandwich in a coffee shop (I miss SF Bay Area). Bring cash, or you'll have to withdraw money from their ATM machine with $2 fee - and realize that with that $2, you could buy a cup of Joe.",2
"Nobu, Nobu, you truly failed me.\n\nI really love your sushi. I do. I come here every time I come in Vegas. And this time, when I had my S.O., you failed me. Sigh.\n\nWe ordered Miso (normal), Salmon glazed in miso (OK, but not the special, wonderful dish I'm used to), and a mixed sushi platter.\n\nThe rice was too sticky, the nigiri were on the point of self-destruction, and the fish was \""good\"", but not excellent.\n\nAnd boy, Nobu, for your prices, I expect EXCELLENT.",1
"This was my first & last time going here. I went there around 9:30 (they close at 10) Not only did they seem upset my daughter and I came in they managed to mess up everything on the order to where they had to make it again. They were to busy chatting with their friends at the table behind me while I was ordering. The store was disgusting and near the soda machine you couldn't even set your cup down to put a lid on it, as the whole counter was wet with who knows what! Stay away from this location!",0
"Great atmosphere, small place though so during peak times I am sure you will want to have a reservation. The stuffed artichoke appetizer was amazing. They even let me order it at lunch when it isn't on the menu. Great service. The meatball hero was very good. the salad that comes with it is just ok, the balsamic house dressing is a little strong and may not be for everyone. My guest had the spaghetti and meatballs and thought it needed some garlic or oregano, something to give it some more flavor. My meatballs were covered in cheese.",2
"Its more hype than anything. My girls and I ordered the appetizer nachos, chicken strips and the mac and cheese and were utterly disappointed in taste. We had heard a lot about this place but not only did the food take long to arrive, the taste was very bland and basic. The waiter did not come around often and just to get seated took about 30 minutes. We did order the carrot cake sundae and that was about the only thing that made the visit there kinda good. I recommend only getting what they are known for, which is their desserts. Don't bother trying their food.",1
"Given what we paid for our stay, I wasn't impressed at all.  Mandalay Beach is the only reason they got a third star out of me.  I never felt the room was all that clean and even though we had a modern renovated room, the beddings, carpet, and furnishings felt pretty run down.  For such a nice place, the toiletries were pretty disappointing, too.  None of the staff I dealt with were particularly helpful, either.  It's also pretty far down on the strip so it's a hike to get down to the center of everything.  On the plus side, they do have lots of restaurants and shops inside (and Mandalay Beach is really really awesome).",2
"I came across this place after the line at Bacchanal was ridiculous. I personally love hand pulled noodles as not every Chinese restaurant offers it. I ordered Dan Dan Mian and absolutely loved it. It had the spice I was craving and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I must have come here at the right time as the customer service was better than what others have experienced.\n\nLet me warn you, the prices are higher than what you'd expect. The thing is... it's located inside Caesars Palace and not Chinatown.",2
"We were SO excited to try this place out---mainly because every Vegas guide said it was the best Thai anywhere! I think we made a mistake to go for the lunch buffet. First of all, the location is pretty weird. It's in a run-down strip mall and the entrance is in the back. Anyway, it took a LONG while to get there from the Strip as we had to take the Deuce bus and then walk for a while before we found it. So, finally we're there and we're expecting to have a religious experience. Not so. Basically, it was a regualy buffet---I didn't even think it was Thai food for the most part! So, next time we're in Vegas, we're going for dinner. Yes, I'm willing to give it another shot. Seems to me that the great reviews are based on dinner, NOT the buffet.",1
"on our first night at paris, we decided to try this place. found out it was entree with separate sides... but it was too late. we've sat down and became too comfy to leave. i dont eat steak.... so i split a chicken dish. ordered wild mushroom resotttttttttto... which was VERY good.. super yummy. we ordered spinach (bland), french fries (yum), and zuchinni sticks. friends ordered some steak and wine and said it was very good. i believe them... tho to me it didnt look so good. \n\nthe waiter was very nice. made sure my friends were not going to be late for their show. \n\nthe staff was very friendly and nice. they actually move to the side when they see you coming... unlike some rude ones that just race to get through first  =[  \n\nfood was ok. but i didnt like my chicken...",2
"i decided to go to 24/7 only because it was the only nail salon open at the time i went however i had heard they did pretty good work. In my opinion, i highly disagree. They were in a rush to finish my nails and they are the WORST set of nails i have ever had. They were all tired from working doubles and didn't put in any effort to make my nails look good, they just wanted to hurry up and finish. I wouldn't recommend this salon to anyone and if your honestly just going because its open 24/7 it really isn't worth it. I would suggest to wait the next day and go somewhere else and not to mention there extremely expensive!!!!",0
"I came here for lunch and ordered a salad with steak on it.  The steak was blah and there was hardley any of it on the salad.  I took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.  So I ordered the chicken cesear salad...that was the most bland salad I've ever had. You know how there's supposed to be that slight twang of lemon there was none.  The chicken was so bland and chewy it was very difficult to eat.  There was no seasoning on the chicken whatsoever.  I'm thinking it was some left over chicken from somewhere.  Needless to say I left there hungry.  \n\nMy lesson learned...when you go to a bar, order bar food.  You should have better luck with the wings.",1
"NOTE: The restaurant is located right off I-60 on your right hand side, so make sure to turn into that first plaza, so that you don't miss it! \n\nI came here on a Saturday around 11 am, and a table for 2 was about a 15 minute wait. The restaurant is very cozy and cute, and the staff is great, full of smiles and very nice. My boyfriend and I ordered:\n\n1) Crab Stuffed Pastry Benedict + Potatoes - The core is imitation crab with artichoke hearts on a crispy pastry, almost like a toasted croissant taste. Then, the whole thing is topped by a poached egg and plentiful hollendaise sauce. The sauce is definitely the best part of the dish. I don't care too much for imitation crab, especially if the dish costs ~$12 (quite pricey for imitation, in my opinion). The potatoes were eh. and there wasn't very much of them.\n\n2) Eggs Benedict + Fruit  - DO NOT GET FRUIT as a side, because it literally came \nwith 2 pieces of orange and 2 small slices of honeydew. Not much of a fruit salad. This was the standard eggs benedict, poached egg over canadian bacon (which was cooked well), and english muffin. The hollendaise sauce was again the star of the show, and smothered all over the plate (hopefully, you like the sauce as much as I did, otherwise it would be too overwhelming)\n\n3) Side Fruit Salad - grapes, kiwi, apples, honeydew, canteloupe, watermelon - now that's a real side fruit salad.\n\nOverall, the food is okay, but the service is great. I'll probably try an omelette next time.",2
"To give you an impression of how good this \""steak\"" restaurant is...I ordered the pork.  I was here with a couple of buddies and we were all hopeful for a spectacular meal. \nMind you the food wasn't horrible, but the experience of a steak house was completely null and void. If I wanted food court atmosphere and noise, I would have opted for the McDonald's McRib and saved myself $130.  \nAdditionally, when I sit down at a famous chefs restaurant, make sure I don't have the capability to make better side dishes or steaks (from what I gather none of the guys who had steak enjoyed it) at home. And for the prices that are charged, offering me a 'french fry' sampler 'compliments of the house' was pretty tacky...don't give ketchup a fancy name in the hopes I'd never had ketchup before and didn't know what it tasted like. \nOh, and pay no attention to the dress code because the staff doesn't. You could easily wear a basketball jersey at the bar and if you show up at just the right time, they let you wear basketball shorts and t-shirts to dine there. Really fancied up the place....\nAt least the waiter was nice...I guess it makes a up for everything else, right? no.",1
"Like others have said,  food was good but the service was slow.  Chips were average but the salsa was good.  I had an enchillada plate and cleaned up everything on my plate.  Perfect size portion IMO.  Bar area has 3-4 large TVs.  Good place to watch a game, play some billards or catch happy hour,  but this probably wouldnt be a good \""date\"" restuarant.",2
"I am the husband that Linda refers to in the 1st review, I CANNOT express how VERY disappointed I am in Estrella Animal Hospital and have certainly spread the word as to their lack of attention and compassion at a time of real need.  We used to bring them 6 clients... yes 6, but now it will be ZERO based on this unfortunate discision made by them on a Friday.  Would any other \""hospital\"" turn away a potential dying patient?  I hate to think what would have happened had we shown up without calling first.",0
"What a bad day to try Fate. I've been wanting to check it out for a long time. I was excited to have my cheat meal and try their beers. We show up and a notice on the door says the kitchen is closed due to their refrigerators being broken. Bummer and unfortunate for them. I had come on an empty stomach, planning to eat and drink. Now I'm in a bit of trouble. Luckily my boyfriend had eaten and could drive home. We asked if we could get se food and bring it in since they couldn't serve and we were drinking after all. The answer was a stern no with a bunch of BS added to it. You would think the liability of serving people without food would override having others food in your establishment. Guess not. \n\nThen there were three guys at the end of the bar. They were three of five in the place. You would think they were hard of hearing the way they were practically yelling at each other to have a conversation. Annoying. We took out tasting flights and moved to a table. \n\nAnother couple came in and were so annoyed by the loud patrons they asked that the music be turned up to drown them out. \n\nOveralls not a welcoming experience. Trying to take into account what is their fault and what isn't but the customer service was no bueno and that goes a long way. \n\nMaybe we'll try it again some time...maybe.",2
Forced to stay here because of convenience to the convention center and couldn't get a room at the Mandalay Bay.  It's been probably 10 years since stepping foot in the Luxor.  I am unimpressed.  The place just seems dirty and old.  This place needs a major renovation or just tear it down.  The elevator walls are peeling and tarnished.  Pyramid Deluxe rooms are dark.  There's been a glass sitting at the at the foot of my door since the day I checked in and it's still not been taken away.  I can say I will never be back here again.,0
"This place has got to be kidding.  I specifically drove to the location and explained that I did not the standard rectangle like shaped beef in my beef and onions.  I asked was the beef fresh, not frozen and did they get it frozen and processed.  The lady lied directly to my face and told me that they only have non frozen, fresh meats.  I got home and was horrified and not only that but the fried chicken wings (also frozen but expected) were actually \""horribly spoiled\""  I mean these wings after frying were GREEN in color!  I called back immediately and they sent another batch over to my home down the street and these wings were so small you would need a magnifier to see them; moreover, THEY WERE BURNED BEYOND RECOGNITION AND BLACK.  I called again and this same lady told me that they were going to tell the company where they ordered the product that it was bad!  Not my problem as a customer and she actually tried to sell me other food with more lies.  Last time I go back there.  I also noticed someone wipe their nose and commence with handling food in the kitchen right before my very eyes.  Just Nasty!",0
"Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken, steamed dumplings, and pork egg rolls.  I was really hungry so it hit the spot, but there wasn't that many chicken pieces in my kung pao chicken - a lot of peanuts (as expected) and a whole lot of celery and carrots (aka filler).  So I was a bit disappointed in that.  \n\nThe steam dumplings were good, especially when fresh and hot.  The egg roll was tasty as well - I didn't find it too oily.  Very affordable and a generous portion - I had the leftovers the next day.",2
Nice views of the Bellagio fountains from the patio if you don't mind looking past all of the Las Vegas Blvd. traffic. Food is okay and service was good. Best thing we had was the shrimp appetizer. All in all we weren't thoroughly impressed but it was an okay spot to go for lunch. I can see how tourists would like this place.,2
"Check your food before you leave the drive-up!!!\nI've been going to this restaurant regularly for over 5 years and can count on one hand how many times they have gotten my order right.  This is the only restaurant I've ever frequented that I have to literally open up the bag, pull out by burrito, unwrap it, and peel open the tortilla to MAKE SURE it is what right!  Unfortunately, they make it wrong 90% of the time and end up having to make it again.  You would think a small business would get tired of throwing away food because it was made incorrectly, but you would be WRONG.  On one occasion I didn't  check it before driving home and found out it was wrong so I drove all the way back to have it made correctly;  they made it again and STILL SCREWED UP MY ORDER!  \nThe food is very good and a decent value.  However, the frustration of dozens and dozens of screwed up orders, coupled with a very dangerous location where you are approached by panhandlers WHILE WAITING IN YOUR CAR in the drive-up, has left me as an ex-customer of Armandos.  Never again will they screw up burrito!  Is it really rocket science to make a frickin' burrito with ONLY CARNE ASADA AND CHEESE AND NOTHING ELSE???",1
"My husband and I along with our children, flew in from another country to spend our last week with our oldest son who will be leaving for boot camp with the US marines shortly. We rented a van (only my husband was registered to drive) and drove over an hour to the salt river recreation park on July 17 2014 at 12:50 pm. The plan was that he would drop off my 11 yr old daughter, 17 yr old son along with myself and pick us up at 7 pm.  Upon arrival we were informed that because my husband and six yr old brought us and stepped foot on their property we would not be allowed to tube. We stated that my daughter and husband were only dropping us off as we rented the van that only he could drive,  but the senior staff rudely informed us that this was their policy  and they were not going to change it. They were completely heartless, rude and offered no apology for the fact that their website had no mention of this policy. We will never know what fun we could have had but were very disappointed with the staffs response. At no place on their web site does it state that tubers will be denied if they are dropped off or have someone under 8 yrs old in their car on their property. Yes we knew she could not tube and had no plans of even having her stay. The staff were completely unworkable and even admitted that this is not stated anywhere on their web site. As bad as this is I would have appreciated them saying,\"" We are sorry you drove all this way but come back tomorrow and ask for me and I will give you a deal as this was not your fault.\"" This would have been true customer service even in a hard situation.",0
"I love Cold Stone.  I've been patronizing them since they were just starting up.  Now they are a huge corporation and sometimes I have a hard time going because of it.  The one thing that makes it easy to not go is the AZ Center location.\n\nThis Cold Stone is staffed by the laziest, rudest, worst employees ever.  Most Cold Stones get a bit chaotic because employees are running around trying to get through the line of customers.  Not at AZ Center.  They operate in slow motion, if they operate in any kind of motion at all.  There are always 4 or 5 employees working but almost all of them are in the back.  The one out front does all of the work and usually takes a break between customers to go into the back to txt someone.  Asking for anything beyond a simple scoop of ice cream is turned into a chore by these kids.  Don't you dare ask for a smoothie or something that requires them to \""go get something from the back\"" because you may never see them again.  \n\nThe girls that work here all have 6 inch fake nails and the boys all have tear-drop tattoos under their eyes.  It is a wonder that management doesn't fire them all but, after seeing a manager, I realize that this business is simply a front for either prostitution or dealing drugs.",0
"My wife and I waited for a while to be seated despite several tables being open and cleaned. The regulars, who came in several minutes after us, are catered to by the staff (several parties were seated as we were but their tables had chips and salsa already waiting and they received their service at the same time we did). The food itself was good but lacked spice. I wasn't impressed but I wasn't unimpressed either. It is just an OK place to eat. Next time we'll drive a few more miles.",1
"Not what I expected at all.  There are three great parts to my experience at Fleming's; the service, the atmosphere, and the drinks.  We came here for  restaurant week for a group of 4. Now I understand restaurant week you try to dumb the menu, which I knew before hand.  I ordered an uptown Manhattan which was probably one of the best drinks I have had in the area. Our server was quick, attentive, and even helped snag an extra chair for a guest we didn't know that was coming.  The ambience is dimly light (fake candles though) and very romantic/modern.  The bar area even looked nice to grab a few drinks.  \n\nSo next we get our food orders.  We started with an appetizer of sweet chile calamari which I was overall impressed with.  Crispy, chewy, and the sweet chile taste was great and not overbearing.  The salad came next and nothing to thrilling, just a bag of lettuce dropped on my plate.  I didn't care about that I was waiting for the steak.  So while ordering my steak I asked for it to be cooked medium and inquired about what side there would be.  There was no side, but I could upgrade to a side of asparagus for $10. Really?  $10 for a couple pieces of asparagus.  So we decided to order sides \""family style\"" which just meant a normal sized side where everyone got a teaspoon worth. Whatever, I didn't care bring on the STEAK!  So here it comes magically floating in my waiter's hand only to be magically going into my box at the end of the night.  I ended up donating this box to a homeless person ( duck voice guy).  The steak was the equivalent of what you would receive at a wedding, It was brown in the middle and cooked more to the tune of medium-well.  The taste just wasn't there.  Finally, they topped it off a tiny square of cheesecake which I would have preferred a small slice compared to this tiny portion.\n\nI totally expected more from a place like this.  I understand it is restaurant week, but this did not do anything to win me over.  I actually would have been happy if just the steak was good, but daaaaaaaaaaaamn comes to my mind when thinking about it.  $85 for a terrible steak, an appetizer, and two manhattans.  I am pretty sure I could have went to another steakhouse such as Sullivan's and  spent the same price while receiving a Grade A steak.  Unfortunately I won't go back here for client meetings or dates.  I wonder if the homeless guy even chucked my steak in the trash.",1
"this is a review from during their 1st year\n\ni visited the village right before the grand opening in 2012. i was excited to see something really awesome. did it met my expectations? yes and no\n\nyes because the sculptures were something to behold even though the chapel wasn't done when i was there. went through each room and looked at the details they put in. that was the interesting part\n\nno because besides looking at rooms and maybe paying for a night, there was nothing else to do. they had a restaurant as well as a bar but outside of those, no activities whatsoever. i'm not the kind of person who'll stand there, drink in hand and talk. if i'm going to do that, i prefer in a warmer cozier place\n\nthey decided to not open for the 2014 season because of a lack of funding. they may never open again. the premise of the village is great but the execution is lacking. it needs activities to attract the crowd or at least, get them to come back. not a lot of people enjoy freezing their butt off\n\nhopefully, they'll get the necessary funding so they can re-open and continue to offer something interesting during winter but i hope that they'll offer more than just a drink with a side of butt freezing",1
"Pat, I notice in your comment that you say all your produce is fresh not frozen.  What about your proteins?  In a previous review comment, it was noted that your scallops were frozen.\n\nFrankly, I'm a little surprised that your only response is that your produce is fresh not frozen.   That response does not encourage me to give your establishment another chance.",0
"We drove thirty minutes tonight to check this place out. Unfortunately, a gentleman greeted us and a few other customers by saying, \""our fryer cook went home. The oil is too full and I had to turn it off\"". We were not able to get any donuts. I totally understand safety comes first but I would assume he would have at least passed out coupons or vouchers to come back. I'd still love to check this place out but am disappointed in the customer service.",0

Bref, je ne pense pas retourner au Chien Fumant en soir\u00e9e car je pense qu'il y \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al d'autres restaurants plus abordables et aussi bons.",1
"I have a gift certificate for an Ultimate Makeover - 2 1/2 hours of consultation, cut, color, style and makeup.  I was really excited to try the Spa and in desperate need of a haircut so I called right away to make an appointment. I was lucky enough that the first available appointment, although 2 weeks away was on a Friday night.  I booked the appointment and made big plans to go out with friends to debut my new look (really, how often do you get to have your makeup professionally done for a night out.) Flash forward to an hour before my much anticipated appointment I received a voicemail message informing me that Mallory was running behind with another appointment and I would need to call to reschedule mine.  WTF? You're cancelling my appointment and not even apologizing or offering me any option like a shorter service?\n\nI swallow my anger and return the call think that perhaps since they canceled my appointment, they would find a way to quickly accommodate me with a new appointment or perhaps upgrade me for the inconvenience.  Nope.  I was informed that Mallory's next time slot was a week and a half out or I could see someone else on a Tuesday - Who needs their makeup done for a Tuesday night?\n\nHonestly if it wasn't a gift certificate I would just cancel and go somewhere else. This is NOT a great first impression.\n\nTo be fair, I would like to add that their phone staff have always been delightful. So that and the limitations of yelp are the only reason they get a star.  I will update after I have my service, hopefully they are worth the inconvenience and irritation.",0
Stayed at GN for a weekend visit with my GF.  This hotel is terrible with even worse service. They advertise free valet but we could not get in as they were full And ended up parking in Bridger St lot 3 blocks away. Management just gave us some lame excuse but no real help. The room was nice but slightly dated. No refrigerator microwave. And the room was not really clean.  We found dirty clothes in the couch cushions. Also got charged a Fremont charge. Would not stay here again.,0
"I would give this \""hotel\"" a negative 5 stars if it were possible. I was harassed catcalled and followed during my stay. I filed a report with \""security\"" but they are NOT to be trusted. Some of my items were missing. I checked out but never got any refund for the rest of my week and a half stay. This place is NOT SAFE especially for women. PLEASE BEWARE!!",0
A tourist trap where location may be the only thing to recommend it.   Food at a level lower than a chain Italian and service was completely absent minded. At least they comped a drink and a meal from our party of four.  Avoid as there are so many good options why waste your limited dining experience on a restaurant that has such indifferent food and service?,0
"Won't even try to deny it.  I'm a Bath & Body Works junkie! \n\nThere's a Wallflower in almost every room of my house; hand soap in my bathrooms and kitchen. \n\nIf B&BW ever discontinued the Sensual Amber, Forever Red or Country Chic body care lines, I might curl up and die- been using Sensual Amber since 2007! \n\nYeah, you get the picture. \n\nAssociates are always super helpful and fun to chat with whether you're looking for something new to try, getting your standbys or simply browsing on your lunch break.\n\nLook for Buy 3, get 3 free on body care. 4 for $20 Wallflowers. 5 for $15 hand soaps. Sometimes 2 for $22 candles!  \n\nWhy this review lost two stars: One of the managers! Lady is extra pushy on sales, so forget a peaceful \""window shopping\"" session. Have witnessed her being an angel in the face of customers, then an absolute troll to her associates in the same breath. Just plain awful.  \n\nAlso, as a previous reviewer mentioned: She will always assume you're shoplifting, especially if you're on a mission and know exactly what you're going to purchase. Space bubble: Please respect it!\n\nBut overall, great customer service and products! Will I continue shopping here? You betcha!",2
"Good little spot for a Arizona nightclub. Really weird clientele.. Some guests dressed nice.. Some guests in flip flops, shorts and sports jerseys. Drinks reasonably priced. Service was good. Music was pretty good. Men's restroom stall did not have a separator and considering the waste of money they put into some things in the club you would think they would spend the $100 for a privacy wall.",2
"At first glance, this place seems pretty shady. There's a random little cafe inside, that I wouldn't mind trying. I really like that you can request really anything you'd like, and they'll order it for you. The guy at the counter was super nice and told us about the tastings they hold every weekend. We'll definitely be back.",2
"I am a big fan of anything Mario Batali does. I mean venetian should be renamed Batali considering the handful of restaurants he has opened in the hotel.  After the pool we decided to grab a bite at B&B, I made reservations and the staff was friendly.  They asked about any table allergies before we were seated and were so good about explaining which dishes had nuts in them before we ordered.  The service was great.  The food was OK. LA has so many burger places that its hard to outdo the places I have tried. B&B was no Plan Check. The most memorable thing about it was the onion rings.",2
"Where to start.  Hubby and I stopped here for takeout 5/31/13. He ordered the BBQ short ribs, and I ordered the bourbon chicken - to go.  We also ordered two of the boba teas. While we were waiting for our food, I decided to use the restroom. It looked like the floor hadn't seen a mop in a month. I went back out to the dining area and took a good look around. It was clean, and from what I could see of the kitchen, it appeared clean. OK, so maybe someone just doesn't like to clean the restroom.\n\nWe got our food in a timely manner and headed home. When we got home, I discovered something I'd never seen before. We had both ordered the macaroni salad with our meals. Both of our meals had that salad in the same to-go container as our hot food!  What the??  This made the salad extremely warm and gross. On top of that, the sauce from my chicken had invaded that compartment of the container. Yuck!\n\nOK, so maybe the scoop of salad isn't such a big deal, we can eat the rest of our meal. Here's where the review gets confusing. While both the ribs and chicken were cooked very nicely, there was NO flavor to either of them. \n\nDoubtful we will be back, unless just to grab a boba, since those were fine.",1
"Ehh. We went into Carmines after walking by it on our way to Trevi in the forum shops (which to start off, I would advise you to go there instead). Seeing that it was family style, we were excited. So we decide to give it a try and our experience was not very good.\n\nThey start out by giving you one menu for the table and some cold bread. I wouldn't complain about cold bread, however this bread had some sort of marinara sauce on it, so it was cold crust sauce on cold bread. They also gave out odd pretzel like sticks as well. We look at the pasta dishes and decide to get the \""Ragu\"", the most expensive thing on the menu. Meatballs, sausage, and pork. Sounds good! We get the dish and it gets served out...and it was just gross. WAY too much sauce, which is WAY too acidy. Trust me, I have been going to italian places since the 70's when I lived in New York. This sauce was horrible. Maybe the can they used was bad? The meatballs were just that...basic balls of meat. And the sausage was just one long sausage...not even sliced or cooked well. The pork was also weird...just salty skins of pork randomly placed in this garbage pile.\n\nNeedless to say after the 4 of us decided we were eating sh*t, we told the waitress and she immediately took our plates and the pasta away. 10 minutes later she hands us the bill, which is for the entire plate of pasta we didn't eat. What?? We ask the manager and she takes the bill in a huff....and returns with the bill with the drinks for about $12. The waitresses advice? Try not to order pasta if you don't want to eat something acidy. \n\nWe left a $20 and left and went to Trevi for a real dinner. I'm guessing this place only survives because it is in a tourist trap and most tourists aren't looking for quality food.",0
"I've always wanted to stay at the Luxor so was glad to finally have the chance, and would certainly do so again in future.\n\nWe originally booked a Pyramid Room, and was upgraded to a room in one of the Towers. Though I would have loved to have stayed in the Pyramid itself, a King size bed was much more enticing.\n\nOur room was clean and large (Hello two wardrobes with lights? I like!), the shower and the bath tub being separate to one another was a bit odd, but whatever. The bed itself was amazingly comfortable. I'm usually not a fan of hotel beds, but plenty of soft pillows, comfortable mattress and clean bedding.\n\nThe resort fee? Lame. If you're going to charge me extra, how about having WiFi? For all the marketing around the hotel encouraging you to Check in on Foursquare or get social with the Luxor, providing WiFi to your paying guests seems like a no brainer.\n\nWe did receive 2 free drink coupons for each night we were staying at the hotel, so the additional resort fee wasn't that big of a deal as we got 6 drinks out of it. Heads up if you're expecting the included newspaper to arrive in the morning at your room - it doesn't, you need to pick it up in a store near the check-in. \n\nAlso, if you're craving coffee in the morning, you'll just have to suck up the additional cost Starbucks charges in the hotel, the prices are jacked up, but to be expected.\n\nCons: \n\n- End of the strip\n- Mandatory resort fee\n- No WiFi\n- No coffee maker in your room\n- Worst buffet\n- Pool isn't open very late (closed at 6pm while we were there)\n \nPros:\n\n- Dude. Ancient Egyptian theme. Sweet!\n- Pretty inexpensive for Vegas\n- Titanic Exhibit. Surprisingly very good. Was expecting something super cheesy but it was very well put together and curated.\n- Easy connections to the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay\n- Possible Criss Angel spottings makes for much hilarity. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our check-in was pretty quick (we arrived 11pm on a Friday night), quick check out and clean, comfortable room. I'd stay again for sure, but probably won't for some time as I like to try out different hotels when in Vegas.",2
"I have been to this restaurant before because i attend a comedy show across the street every Saturday night.  I took my friend in with me for the first time and tried to order a cal-zone.  I asked for the cal-zone to be made with no peppers on onions on half, to this reply they stated this is impossible and they can not do this.  I spent 3 years working in a pizza restaurant and know this is completely something they would have been capable of.  I was even nice enough to explain how to make it and they still refused to make what we wanted.  Not only did they refuse but they had a horrible attitude in regards to it.  In fact the first guy that was helping us left without saying a work then another female came up and had even a worse attitude problem.  I even asked if I could speak to the guy who would make the pizza and explain to him how to do it and the continued to say no.  At this pizza restaurant its either THEIR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY, if you have  any allergies or do not like certain things on your pizzas/calzones I would recommend NOT going there. In face we left and ordered pizza hut and got 3 times the food for the price and the way we wanted it.",0
"The pizza is pretty good but the service could be A LOT better.\n\nCame here for takeout on a Monday night.  When I got in line, there was only one other couple in front of me.   I ordered a simple margherita pizza with mushrooms.  Overall the crust was good but burnt even for a neopolitan style pizza.  The sauce is good but overwhelmingly garlicky (and I love garlic).  The cheese melted well but soon came tough and rubbery.  The basil was nonexistent.  I was most disappointed by the first bite, mainly because everything slid right off.  \n\nAs for the salad, also underwhelming.  I got the burrata with artichoke tapanade and olives.  There was almost no arugula.  The olives were extremely salty.  Also of note, nobody bothered to make the salad while my pizza was cooking despite there being almost no wait.  I had to wait first for the salad, then for the bread to be toasted.  So maybe that's why by the time I ate my pizza it was a rubbery,  soggy mess.\n\nOverall, pretty pricey for mediocre food.  Don't think I'll be returning if i can help it!",1
"I would give this place a 2.5 but since I can't I'm going to give it a 2.  I was not impressed with this place although I should have been.  The place was lively and comfortable.  Peanut shells on the floor and a Jack-elope bust on the wall always make me feel at home.  The waitress was great but this is where this review takes a turn for the worst.\n\nI ordered the full rack of ribs and my wife got the steak.  The appetizer salads they brought out were so filled with cheese and very buttery croutons that there was less veg than toppers.  The big problem were the ribs for me.  They were dry, and I mean bone dry which is no good.  My wife's steak was huge and done well so no complaints.  We finished it off with apple pie that had a strange carmel topping on the side that spread like warm taffy... not impressed.\n\nNot the worst but I have definitely seen better.  Price isn't too bad for a \""steak house,\"" but Ill take my business elsewhere next time.",1
"This place is delish! Every time we have family or friends visiting vegas we take them here on Sundays. Red velvet pancakes are amazing! I only gave three stars because compared to the other babystacks their Adobo fried rice omelet is on the salty side, too much to bare. You need to drink a ton of water or eat more rice to balance all the salt intake. I thought it was only one day but been there several times and still so salty. Wish they took reservations or possibly putting our name on the waiting list as we drive there. Oh well. Guess that's how they make their money. I still drive to the original babystacks to get there adobo fried rice omelet. Just waiting for the Henderson location to get it right. Otherwise everything else is yummy!!",2
"Finally I get to write a review i honestly feel is not 5 stars.A group of about 10 friends stayed here over the weekend and The rooms were cold, the suites were awesome, thought not quite worth the price. The elevator keys were annoying since they could get you to any floor, almost pointless. The parking was free which was pretty awesome. Our tv was hit or miss for actually working, we had to call a maintenance man at one point. It took 2.5 hours for him to show up too....\nAnyways if you have an iphone just forget about it working. I mean its not even worth trying. All of us were texting each other and receiving various messages hours later. making a phone call was worthless so we resorted to land lines. \nIf all you want is comfy beds and blinds that shut out the sunlight this is the place for you. everything else was hit and miss",2
"The food is really good and I like that you get to pick all your items. However, the bar sucks. Not only does it have slow service but they also give you barely any alcohol in your drinks and you could leave with a stomach ache from all of the mix they give you.",2
Negative: I had a steak meal here which made me sick for an entire week. Hell I was pissed. \n\n\nPositives : Great Hotel Rooms (very comfy) and not so expensive. There's flat screen TVs which you don't find in every hotel.\nGraveyard bowling at 1 dollar a game (if I remember correctly) rocked. Pure awesomeness. \n\n(I can't help giving a 1 rating on this despite the positives),0
"Located overseeing the pool so it was a nice view\n\nCame here for breakfast because we were near it\nI ordered the corn beef hash plate. Kind of disappointed. The cornbeef was bland, the potatoes were bland. The cheese was bland. Only thing that gave it kind of a kick were the diced bell peppers. Had to douse it with tobasco to taste anything\nGF ordered the frech toast with bananas. Came with 2 eggs, side of bacon. Pretty tasty fresh toast. Only thing i wondered was why they cut the banana in half but left the peel. Had to scrape the edible part out from the peel\n\nIt was an OK eats. Was more let down than anything because I read great things about it.",2
"I heard a small hype about this place which is new in Charlotte. I've have many great nights out at the NC Music Factory so I was pretty excited to check it out. \n\nAfter spending a few hours at Fridays at the Factories we headed in to Wet Willies. We waited in a random line even though it was pretty empty inside. The hold up? They were using electronic handheld scanners to check ID's. I've never seen this in Charlotte, but I assume its no big deal. I thought wrong.\n\nThe girls infront of us ID's would not scan, but they got pushed right thru. My friends ID scanned fine. My ID would not scan for some unknown reason. They tried 5+ times, but could not get it to register. So I'm just standing there.. waiting.. Finally after inspecting my ID like it was some kind of fake they show me this piece of paper. This paper has peoples names, addresses, etc. All sorts of contact information just laying out on the counter. They explain I have to write in my information to get in.\n\nYeah right. You just let two females in, but want me to fill out some paper work? The bouncers had no ideas the females where with us so I pulled them and my friend back out. I explained I was leaving. They just gave me a 'so what' look. \n\nI walked next door and walked right in to Black Bear Saloon where the experience was great. After that I headed to Halo to finish the night .\n\nI will never go back to Wet Willie's and ensure everyone I know will avoid it.",0
"Meh. What would you expect for a random bar inside a crappy Vegas hotel? It's food. It's overpriced. It's not great. I had the french dip and the meat was super dry and the au jus mediocre. The waffle fries were just your standard waffle fries presumably out of a freezer (i.e., pretty awesome actually!). Certainly would never seek this place out, but if you're stuck in the Rio and want some quick food...",1
"By far the WORST Starbucks drive thru I've ever driven through. I've given them three different chances now. And its only gotten worse every time. I've currently been in the drive thru for the last twenty minutes.(i know what you're thinking, \""why did he wait that long?\"",) well I didn't have a choice. Can't back up once your in. Well not only do you wait in line, but once you get to your window, you wait about another 5 minutes. Cutting this one off",0
Was in town for bike week had heard good things about this place so I was looking forward to my breakfast. To bad I was dissapointed. had the black forest omlete. It was like any other omlete and the potatpoes whats up with that ? Hash browns or country potatoes only . Save the chips for lunch!,1
"Rating businesses on a 5-star system can be uncomfortable. We've been accustomed to thinking that only a 4-5 star restaurant is acceptable but please remember that 3-stars in YELP means \""A-OK\"" which in my book, means I would return.\n\nCame in Sunday afternoon for a quick bite to eat at the recommendation of a friend. Within our group of four, none of us had been there before but were all happy with the food. \n\nWe had a couple of instances where our server may have gotten overwhelmed. We were her first table, but quickly picked up 3-5 more tables and that could have crossed her threshold of comfort. She was VERY sweet and we did not pressure her. From our table, three of us had been bartenders/servers so although we were understanding, our expectations were higher. \n\nOur guacamole was asked to be served without pumpkin seeds, it came with. We were given an additional guacamole as compensation. One of our tacos was asked to be served without the traditional flour tortilla, it came with the flour tortilla. There were just a few instances where our very specific dietary requests were not met. \n\nRegardless, the food was pretty decent. I was not impressed with their chicken taco but was very happy with the pork (had pineapple in it too). For the bigger eater, the bill can run a bit high than you might expect but you can tell this is absolutely a great spot for happy hour.\n\nWe will be back!",2
"I wasn't impressed. Maybe you need to go in the am but we walked in and I was excited to try something new. I asked the guy behind the counter what was the most popular item and he said it was the cream cheese croissants. He told me people order it by the buckets. I decided to try it and my husband got the cronut. The guy also said free upgrade from small to large boba because they ran out of small cups. My husband was a sucker and said yea. \n\nVerdict: the boba milk tea was overly sweet and the boba was hard. The cream cheese croissant was good but not necessarily something I would go back for. My husband wasn't impressed with his cronut either. Overall it's an ok place, but I definitely would not be back anytime soon.",2
"sad part is Ive been putting off writing this review for awhile b/c I didnt want to think about it. \n\nBAR: I live really close to this casino maybe 7-10 minutes. the 1st time I came here the bar was kind of hidden behind the Roxy. But we really enjoyed it. Especially the gentleman bartender I want to say his name is Robert or Raul. Well since the renovation we came bk and sat at the bar which opens out to an awesome view of the mystic falls scenery and different colored christmas lights. \n\nMy last visit here was not too long ago, shortly after my bday inwhich my bf gave me a VERY EXPENSIVE NEW PURSE. We'd seen it while shopping almost a year ago and he remembered and went bk to get it. Sweet right? well I put my very new expensive purse in the empty chair nxt to me. . Ladies understand this. . \n\nthe guy kept grabbing my purse and the chair closer to him. so i pulled it back since this made me very VERY nervous. Then he yells at me saying how do you know someone's not sitting there? I said b/c there's nobody sitting there and no food there. so he slides a drink in front of it. after taking a huge sip? wth? really? I ignored him, an hr later and to make a long story short he gets the manager and she sides w/ him and instead of being mad at the fact that he grabbed my purse out of my hands and threw it across the bar - she gets a chair to put my purse nxt to the chair it was already in. \n\nLuckily the guy and his imaginary friend finished cussing me out and left. I will never go bk. The bartender the male and female were both nice to me but neithe rof them stuck for me to tell the manager that no, there was never anybody sitting there and this guy was being a jerk to a local patron. \n\nThe custoemr that sat there after him was so nice and bought my bf and I a round of drinks, so nice. he was visiting from CA and was great.  Sad how you can have both ends of the spectrum within minutes. I cant blame the bar/cantina for the behaviour of this guy but I can blame them for the handling of the situation. Looking back I should have just left when he started harrassing me but hindsight is 20/20. \nI will never go back to this casino again.",0
"I came into store with a picture of the purse I am looking for. Associate informed the that purse doesn't come with the color I am looking for and made me purchase the color they have, just to close to deal. Then, I found the one I am looking for at the Macy's. This so unethical. They just wasted my time & money. Now, i have to wait for return process. Wait couple days to receive money in my account.",0
"Upon entering subway this evening (12/11/14) there were no workers out front. After hearing the bell ring multiple times from two other guests entering and one leaving, as well as the phone ringing and customers shouting \""hello\"" into the back, two unhappy workers emerged from the back with not so much as a hello or a smile. Not only is it ridiculous to wait ten minutes with no one checking to see if a customer has come in, but the customer service skills of the two workers were some of the worst I've ever seen. Not even so much as an apology for the wait? I for sure will not be coming back to this subway ever again.",0
"This was terrible. The staff was so incredibly rude and not helpful at all. As a tourist town, I expect people to know that tourists will ask questions! Every time we spoke with staff, they were rude or didn't know the answers and didn't do anything to find out. There were no coffee pots in the room, the gym is meh, there are no fridges in the room, and I can't tell you how many times the cleaning staff walked into our room despite the do not disturb sign. I absolutely do NOT recommend.",0
"Used Yelp to try to find a place to get a breakfast sandwich on our walk up to Edinburgh Castle and Hula looked the most promising. As much as I'd like to support local businesses, I wish we had just gone to Starbucks. I got a bagel with cream cheese and my husband got a ham/cheese bagel. They were fine, but so overpriced. For the same amount of money we could have gotten breakfast sandwiches with better stuff in them (like actual eggs!) from Starbucks.",1
"Why can't I give 0 stars or better yet negative stars? \n\nNever, ever, ever again! \n\nThough the atmospheres is extreme old school and borderline depressing we used  to stop in frequently because the food was pretty good and the prices reasonable. Having not been there in a while we recently ventured to Oakland to revisit an old standby only to be extremely disappointed.\n\nThe DH ordered a hamburger which was pretty good and generous in size. It's a good thing too because he ended up having to share with me because my crab cake sandwich was inedable. Two bites into it I knew something was wrong - extremely fishy tasting and obviously no where close to fresh. I don't mess around with seafood. Food poisoning is no fun! I pushed my barely touched sandwich away and there it sat for the remainder of our visit. Never an inquiry from our server if there was a problem or if I wanted something else. \n\nWe won't be back. Why bother? Who wants to fight Oakland traffic and parking challenges to eat at a restaurant that hasn't updated their decor in 20 years only to walk away hungry or even worse with food poisoning?",0
"I gave this place three chances over the years and each time I was disappointed so I am officially DONE! The latest event: had a slow leak in a tire, called and was told to come on in. I explained that there was no visible reason for the leak so it needed to be removed from the rim and further examined. I arrived and was treated rudely by a man who acted as if I was putting him out by being there and asked \""who told you you could just come in\""? A mere 15 minutes later he came into the GROSS lobby and told me nothing was wrong with the tire, it was fine. I knew that was false but wanted to get my five year old and myself out of there! So I went to TOWER TIRE in Aspinwall and they rock and did the right thing, finding the pin hole and fixing it for $10.70! \nThree chances is enough for me! For decent service for a Honda try Valley Honda in Monreoville.",0
"Worst service ever!  I am giving it 2 stars because the bathroom toilet is my new lover.  But seriously worst service ever.  Our waitress was such a bitch she actually rolled her eyes and sighed while one of my dining companions asked her questions about the food.  Really?  She had no problem sitting with the 2 dudes at the table right next to us, being little miss flirty flirt.  Every single drink we ordered came without a garnish.  Dirty martini up with olives is not hard.  Vodka tonic always comes with a lime.  Twice we actually went to the bar ourselves to get the garnish.  Totally lame.  I wish I got our servers name so I could personally lambast her here on Yelp.  The manager tried to smooth things over, but when a situation sucks that bad just saying sorry isn't enough buddy.  This place can kiss my ass.",1
"First time with Avis -- and decidedly the last. My boyfriend and I booked a rental for an upcoming trip and didn't receive a confirmation email. We called to request another sent to us and were puzzled when the reservation was lost, but more so when the customer service agent was unwilling to help us locate it. Our puzzlement turned to indignation when the \""lost\"" reservation somehow ended up charging my boyfriend's credit card just fine.\n\nA week and a half later, the reservation is still MIA, they have not reimbursed any of the charges, and no explanation has been forthcoming. Thankfully the credit card company was notified early on, so if Avis's inept business practices persist, we won't be held accountable.",0
"(basement comic store only) Back issues of comics were packed much too tightly into the longboxes. They might want to work on this. The store was clean and well-lit. They have a good selection of Marvel and DC titles, but if you're looking for an independent title, you're pretty much s.o.l. and should head over to Phantom of the Attic in Oakland. I do not work for Eide's so thankfully I have never had to wash the boss's car.",1
"They provide good service, but are probably one of the most expensive vets on the east side. $110 for an exam/consult and \""lab\"" work for a healthy dog. That didnt include any flea/tick preventive. They are very quick to offer the most expensive services first, then discuss more cost effective alternatives after you say no. Dr. Brittany is very nice and good with my dog.",1
"This place is great if you are looking to wash your dog by yourself. They layout for self-wash is good. The reason I am giving this place 1 star is because of my horrible experience with the groomer named Michelle. I called to inquire about grooming and was told that it includes a wash, nail trim, ear cleaning and haircut. I made my appointment 2 weeks in advance.\n\nWhen it was time for my appointment, I dropped my dog off and the groomer was not friendly at all. She just told me to lock my dog up in their cage. She didn't even take a second to ask me anything or talk to me since she was busy working with another dog. I left and waited, it took her 6 hours to call me back to pick my dog up. \n\nI had my friend pick up my dog since I couldn't. She paid the grooming fee plus tip. Once I saw my dog, it came to my surprise that his hair wasn't cut, nails weren't trimmed, and his left ear was super red. I called the groomer to voice my concern and instead of making it right with me, she made an excuse saying and I quote \""you should have clarified and said what you wanted done with your dog\"". I then said I didn't have a chance since she made it so hard to talk to her and I did mention what I wanted when I made the appointment (plus I shouldn't have to, I was informed that the grooming package included nail trim and hair cut so that's what I expected) and her response was, again I quote \""I don't remember every appointment I book!\"" how unprofessional!! Maybe you should write it down or at least be friendly enough to talk to your customers!\n\nTo make matters worse, my dog got an ear infection in his left ear which cost me $60.00 to treat. It was difficult trying to put the ear drops on my dog. After the 10 day treatment, the experience left my dog scared to be touched on his head and by his ears.\n\nIf you don't want to go through hell, DO NOT go here for grooming! You'll waste your money, be misinformed, not get the service you want, give trauma to your dog and be treated unprofessionally.",0
"So much for \""America's Friendliest Airport\"".\n\nSo I admit, I reluctantly allowed myself to be shipped off to AZ post-immigration legislation fiasco, so I was not thrilled to be there at all, BUT whatever - it was for work, and well, it is what it is.\n\nI had to snicker just a tad when I read the logo at the airport - I guess when they meant that they're the \""friendliest\"", they surely could not have meant their Gestapo-like TSA agents at the security checkpoint or the chick at the airline counter who yelled at EVERY SINGLE PERSON who walked up to her before she called them over, \""WAIT!!! I'M NOT DONE!!\"" (I won't mention the airline, being that it's my airline of choice) -- so, yeah.  If the interaction with Security sucked, and so did the experience at the airline counter, not sure how many more chances you'd get to prove to the average traveler that this is in fact the \""friendliest\"" airport.  Give me a break.",1
"I was underwhelmed by my experience at The Vig Fillmore. It might have been that we were seated inside instead of on the awesome patio. It might have been that the menu is one of the worst I have seen (Pad Thai and Burgers? Mexican food and Edamame?). It might be their apparent love affair with American cheese, or as I call it, plastic. (Why not use cheddar?) Sorry to say it, but based on their current menu, I most likely will not return. I wish them all the best and hope they create a better menu.",2
I ordered two items for carry-out on 7/28/2013.  I was very disappointed in the quality of my food.\n\nI ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla with chicken and cheese only and a ground beef taco with beef and cheese only.\n\nThey messed up both items.  They gave me a shredded chicken with tomatoes and onions in it and it was all liquidity.  Then they put lettuce on my taco.  The beef was burnt.  I took a bite of each item before throwing it all away.  The chips were stale and the salsa were bland and did not taste fresh at all!  What a waste of $15!,0
"Would not recommend. \n\nWent when it was not that busy. About 7pm on a Thursday night. Less than half full. \n\nThe lady who filled our water looked like she wanted to kill the first baby she could get her hands on. I've never in my life watched somebody kick a cup along the floor, instead of bending over to pick it up. \n\nWe waited more than 25 minutes before our drinks were ordered, and that was only after I got up to find our waitress. Not wanting to wait longer for our food order, we ordered our dinner right then. \n\nFood was okay. Nothing special, but not bad. \n\nOnce it was dropped off at the table, that was the last we saw of the server. Nobody came around to ask if everything was good, if we needed anything, or even to refill the water. \n\nWe finished, and waited 20 minutes. Tables around us that had finished earlier sat around full of empty plates and glasses. Dinner room looked like a bomb had gone off. Nobody came to clean them up. Finally, sick of waiting, I again got up to track down some help to pay the bill. \n\nAs we left, there was a large group of kids and adults in line outside waiting to get in, too bad the empty tables had been sitting full of dishes for half an hour, they all could have been sitting at a table, waiting for service by now instead of standing outside. \n\nI smiled on the way out, as I thought of the world of hurt everybody was in for.",0
"Seafood tasted frozen. Roasted duck was pure grease and fat. The Cheese tasted like Kraft.\n\nThe Shu Mai was ok...\n\nI got sick... I literally got sick from eating here - I don't think it was food poisoning, but my body was very upset that I came here, instead of arguing with my friends more about where we should have gone.",0
"I have to say I was very disappointed with my experience at the Kim vo Salon.  I went in for a pedicure.  I had called and booked my appt the day before.  The receptionist on the phone told me there were 3 different types - I picked the Lemongrass Bamboo.  I was really excited about my appt.  I had booked my appt to follow right after my massage at the spa.  My nail tech (Annie) came into the spa to get me.  She spoke broken English which was fine because I didnt wanna talk anyway.\nFirst off the room where they do the mani pedis is wonderful!  The chairs are fab!  \nI pick my color, get settled and my nail tech tells me there isnt a lemon pedi - just orange.  Ok strange orange isnt even on the menu.  Mind you this pedi is $95.\nShe informs me my feet are very dry - effen duh - we're in the desert Thats why I'm here!\nAll the other techs are giving their clients reccomendations for dinner and shows.  Mine tells me to go to an Asian Buffett off the strip!  WTF am I on candid camera!  \nWell anyway my feet were dry when I went in and they were dry when I came out.",1
If it is important to do to make your flight by relying on an airport shuttle do not stay here.     \n\nI thought the 45 minute wait for the shuttle last night at the airport to get here is bad this morning is ridiculous \n\nI was in the lobby at 915 waiting for the 930 shuttle when I was told there would not be one till 10 am.  Well I just  watched the 10 o'clock leave  at 950 with one person on it with 8 of us still sitting in the lobby.   \n\nThe girls said they will be at 10:15 now.   \n\nWhy is it supposed to run every half hour we need to get the airport to make flights. \n\nThis is ridiculous I don't know who manages here but they have problems.,0
"My friend and I were pretty excited when we discovered this place (only boba place in an 8 mile radius, chyyyeaaaaa - okay totally an exaggeration but you know how it is) \nHowever, after taking a look at the way the tea was prepared, I was completely turned off. Powder. Open jugs of jellies. Blechhh...Still, I wanted to give the tea a try, so I ordered a plane black tea with lychee jelly because I didn't want to risk ordering any milk tea combo. \n\nFirst, I cant believe I paid $4 and change for some tea and jelly - it probably cost them less than 25 cents to make. Second, the service was a complete mess. My drink took more than 15 minutes to prepare, and I'm pretty sure I got my order before some patrons who had placed their order before me. Finally, the tea was okay - but it definitely tasted like it was brewed from a tea bag. I think the jelly was the best part, but jelly is jelly - if they had managed to mess up the jelly, I would have been extremely worried. \n\nI like the concept of the place, but Steepery will need to clean up its act and rethink its pricing strategy before I'm back!",1
I took my daughter to KFC and it was shocking how the uniforms were so dirty at 10:30 am when they just opened and no reason to be dirty.  We walked in and walked right back out because they obviously had a problem with there plumbing.  The smell of sewage was overwhelming! My daughter likes KFC so they get 2 stars for that. Based off of cleanliness it would be no stars.,1
"I went here recently for dinner with my family and about 5 minutes after our appetizer arrived so did our dinner so we didn't even get a chance to enjoy our first round. The steak I ordered was way undercooked when I asked for medium well, It was so red it was dripping.  Our server was very nice about the situation but it was the manager that had an attitude.  The manager explained to me that medium well takes a long time to cook and that's why my new steak was taking so long.. Of course I know that it takes a long time. That's why I was surprised it came out so quick. Terrible service from the manager and I won't be returning.",0
"Damn, I know why Best Buy is closing stores left and right! Their return and warranty policy sucks! I just bought a laptop from them a month ago. The screen started getting squiggly lines. I took it back and they said since I didn't purchase the manufacturers warranty and it was 15 days after my purchase they wouldn't exchange. Best Buy sucks. I'm sticking with Costco from now on into forever!",0
"This buffet is definitely a waste of time and money.   We waited for over an hour in line, only to go in there and see that over half the tables were empty.  Completely empty.  With a line still snaking around the thing.  \n\nI realize that there are VIP guests who can march on through, but come on, there were empty seats ALL OVER!   We arrived at 8pm, and didn't get seated until after 9, when theoretically, we could have been seated within 20-30 minutes.  We were in a mad rush; they don't add more food at 10, and start packin' things up at 10:30.\n\nThere is a wide selection of food, but your money is better spent at Le Village (like someone else pointed out), or at the Spice Market Buffet (in the Planet Hollywood).",1
"Brussel sprouts and sweet potato on my pizza? OK, Enough is enough. The crust is so-so and while I really wanted to like this place, it didn't rock me. We had the meatball pizza and it was OK. I would love to see a real NY or Chicago pizza restaurant in this town. The Wedge salad was good but I do not like dates with my blue cheese dressing thank-you. \n\nService was good and my friends liked the beer, large and varied selection. On to another pizza place.",1
"FastMed? More like SlowMed. This is hands down the worst experience I have ever had with an Urgent Care. The only reason I went is because I received notification that my doctor had left my service network last week. The place had me wait over two hours to see a \""doctor\"" who then said he had no clue what was going on with me. He recommended to take a medication that I actually saw at CVS myself--same exact milligram dosage as well. Not only is the doctor inept (if he is a doctor at all), but I actually think a paperclip is smarter than the staff. They are rude as well, and I actually saw a girl essentially begging to pay the receptionist for her medication when I got in as she stood there for 20 minutes. By the look on her face, she had probably been waiting there since sunrise. \n\nThis place is about as useful as a wet piece of bread. If you are in serious need of urgent care, you would be better off watching a \""do it yourself\"" video on youtube than go to this joke of a place.",0
"Read a lot of positive reviews, so we decided to give it a shot on the morning of my birthday. We ordered several things like the happy, fat kids we are. The waffle sandwich, breakfast burrito, half croissant with fruit and crumbles on top, and a cronut.\n\nLets start with the good. The croissant was very tasty. The servers were friendly and the atmosphere was quaint and inviting. They were nice enough to bring out a honey bun with a candle in it for my birthday. If I could give them 3.5 stars I would.\n\nNow the not so good. We had to clean off our own table because it was covered in crumbs. We had never had a cronut (croissant/donut) before, so why not. Nothing special. Honestly, I would prefer a regular donut over a cronut any day of the week. The breakfast burrito was bland, not much flavor at all. Expected big things from the waffle sandwich. \""A\"" for presentation, but \""C\"" for taste. Just like the burrito, extremely bland. Add some spices and it has a ton of potential.\n\nDebating on whether or not to return. Saw a breakfast pizza come out to the table next to us, which looked interesting. We shall see...",2
"I work nearby and have been to Culver's a few times. I liked the burgers and onion rings. I went with some co-workers one day when I wasn't in the mood for a burger and tried the fried chicken instead and wasn't very impressed. Next time I'll stick with the burgers.\n\nNow as for the frozen custard, I do enjoy it but it only gets an average rating on my sweet tooth craving scale. Ranks above a candy bar from the vending machine, but below a chocolate chip cookie from Paradise Bakery.\n\nLast time I went in, I appreciated that I could pay for my entire order but wait until after the meal to pick up my frozen custard. But then I got annoyed because after showing my receipt to the lady at the counter she handed me a number and put my order in, then proceeded to stand at the counter at chat with another employee. It's a freaking bowl of frozen custard. How hard is that to dish up?",2
"Worse club ever. Took forever to get into even though we were in the very front of the line.\n\nUgly girls, not so skinny girls, old girls, and rude security guys with super annoying flashlights.

"Last girl was too nice by giving them 2 stars. \nI was approached by a young man also, really nice not so pushy. \nMade the appt and met with the camera guy at the store I ran into them at (Bashas)\nThe guy wasnt all that friendly... felt rushed the whole time. \nFinally went to pick up photos at grocery store.   \nSame experience if not worse than last reviewers experience.  I was ambushed with not one girl, but two.   They made sure to have me in between where they were seated.   Right away they praised all the pictures, while I was thinking each time a new picture came out 'Oh my gosh they suck'\nThey then tried to sell me a $500 package. \nI told them right away..... \""I'm not happy with these pictures, I'm just gonna take the little package I paid for\""\nThey asked why.  I explained that the quality was poor..... And it was.   They looked like they were taken with a toss away camera and printed at home. \nI asked how much for the one photo of my son by himself because it wasn't included in the pre-paid package.   They said that they can't do that.... Because they only sell in packages.  ????\nThey tried bringing the price down by a $100 then a bit more.   I kept telling them, No and that I want happy with it.   They kept trying to brainwash me into thinking they are the best quality out there and they are really good.   They said they didn't understand and that the pictures aren't blurry.  \nI told them i didn't think they were blurry.   They are bad quality.   There's a difference.   They had grains in them.   \nThey then brought it down to almost everything they offered with only $300.\nI finally just had to let them know. .. That I wasnt looking for a better deal.   I don't have a problem with spending money on awesome photos.  But they weren't worth$100\nI have taken better photos on my camera and printed them out at Walmart and the pictures were phenomenal.

"The hotel itself was very nice. Friendly staff, nicely appointed etc. The room was large and the bathroom was very nice.

"I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great, chain or otherwise, the food was blah. First, we had to practically beg them to take a reservation for ten, which they sort of honored. At least there were a few free tables they were able to push together when we arrived.\n\nOur waitress was the only shining star - she did a good job of taking care of 9 people with 7 separate checks and she kept the drinks refilled. She was also helpful in getting a couple of the TV's switched over to the Panthers game (they lost).\n\nWe had a few appetizers for the table. The pretzel \""bones\"" were good, served with a couple of different sauces, as were the onion rings with their dipping sauces. If you like cheese fries, try the Fire Stix which were the best part of the meal.\n\nHaving read the reviews, I knew to stay away from the brisket. I went with a \""lunch\"" sized portion of sliced smoked turkey breast. It was dry and not much more than warm. After we asked, the waitress brought out the bbq sauces, which improved the bland taste. The \""fire roasted corn\"" was good - a corn and red pepper medley that was tasty. The mashed potatoes with gravy were good as well, especially when I mixed it with the corn. ;-) Both sides were too small and my friend sitting next to me got an even smaller undersized scoop of potatoes with his salmon.\n\nWe didn't have dessert. They added 18% gratuity to the check, which was understandable for the size of our group.\n\nWould I go back? No, I don't think so.",1
"My son and I got seated and it took our server 15 mins to take our drink order... then another 10 for our food order. THEN 20 mins just to get our food. That day must've been busy because they were out of everything. I seen our server 1 time. She never came to check on us, nor did she actually bring me a ticket. I had to actually go up there to get the ticket.\n\nThe food was ok, nothing crazy delicious. If you want a cheap breakfast, but dont mind waiting 2 days for it this is def your place!",1
"Pizza is pretty good and definitely thick crust. This means a one inch crust ON THE BOTTOM. Salads are typical and I think, iceberg. Delivery area is limited. Oh and if you should happen to need silverware with your take out (because you know, they don't deliver to you 1.5 miles away) be aware they will charge you $.10/piece. It's plastic but rest assured, I'll save it. \n\nMeh. Hopefully I caught them at the end of the night on winter break.",2
"This used to be our favorite breakfast place.  Now the food is hit or miss and service is very spotty.  Sometimes they're really slow, sometimes they just get the order all wrong.\n\nLast time we were there, our eggs over hard came out easy, the bacon was like jerky (which I didn't really mind), and the hash browns were burnt on the bottom.  My dry english muffins were sogged down with butter (squeezed a tbs out of each half).\n\nLike I say, its been spotty so I think I'll give it some time before I try them again.. :/",1
"A French Bistro serving a variety of traditional fair at moderate prices, L'express provides the full french/Montreal experience. Although the calf liver dish was just OK, the bread, pickles and wine list were truly a wonderful component of the dinner. A special mention on their wine list is worth noting. Prices on wines were fair and selection was excellent. I especially enjoyed their fortified wine selections! Great service where servers came across knowledgeable, engaging and humble.\n\nEnjoy Montreal!",2
Your service is terrible. If you're going to tell me your food will be ready in 15 min then I expect 15 min. Why should I ask you after 25 min where my food is? And when I do it takes another 20 min before you bring me my food. I know the Pad Thai isn't that difficult to make.. you know what's more annoying.. When I opened my food. it looked more like pad see ew than pad thai. I hate you Noodles for keeping me hungry and getting my order wrong. I was very upset with this place. I had to pay that much and get treated like a nobody. Noodles will not get any more business from me..,0
"I've heard some people mention this place a few times and say it has great food. Being that I work a few doors down I called and placed a to go order. The man told me it would be 10 minutes. 20 minutes later I walked down and expected to grab my order and run back to work (being that I'm the only employee at the store and it needs to be closed when I'm not there). I got there and sat for over 15 minutes while a man kept running by me saying \""I'll go check on your food, I'll go check on your food\"". The service was just lacking. \n\nFood tasted great but I probably won't be back.",1
"3 stars but might be me. Im not sure if Malaysian Cuisine is my thing. Im not s spicy girl and Im allergic to shrimp so kind of changed the flavor of the dishes. I will say the curry puffs were good- just a little too spicy for me. I also got the basil noodles, and the captians noodles. Roti and lychee drink. The lychee drink- soooo good. \n\nService amazing- just fantastic.\n\nOverall I think its worth trying this place- I came here to experience something new and I enjoyed my experience. The restaurant is very cute, decorated nicely. Like I said I might just not be a Malaysian food kind of gal.",2
"I love the quality of work these ladies do, but their ability to schedule leaves much to be desired.  On more than one occasion I showed for my appointment and was told it was the wrong day, even though I had a text confirmation to show I was correct.  This was always down played.  The last straw was a confirmation for an early morning appointment that I received at 10pm the night before.  I didn't read it until the next morning, honestly because a text a 10pm is RUDE to me unless you are a family member or a close friend.  I texted in the morning to reschedule and I was told 'I was being inconvenient'  Really?  A long standing customer (over 8 months) rescheduling ONCE, when you have rescheduled on me a number of times is inconvenient?  I told them not to bother I would find another facility.  They are great at what they do, but honestly unless you can work around them and their schedule, don't bother.",1
"I would give 4 stars because of the price. But they tried to sneak in Roadside assistance coverage when I rent from this vegas facility twice. I waived all the other coverages, but they didn't even ask if I need roadside coverage. Just asked me to initial. I checked the invoice and went back to ask for refund.   They complied.  I was happy about the price. Not their service.  Would rent from again. Just be cautious of what you sign.  Say NO to all coverage if you have your own insurance.  They'll try to scare you if you have like $500 deductible in your collision coverage.",2
"Clean hallways, clean and new furniture for guests and patients to occupy in the meeting areas.  However, rooms felt a bit cramped, with very little room between individuals.  \nI was taken back at the fact that they won't provide walkers or wheel chairs in-facility for fear the patient may injure themselves.  So, I guess they'd rather have them lay and rot in their own beds.  There is no compassion here; staff show no genuine concern, they're there for a paycheck.  The overall philosophy of this business aren't  genuinely dedicated to their patient's well-being. \n\n*Bring a clothespin for your nose because this whole facility reeks of urine and fecal material.  I can only imagine what it's like to be an immobile patient there.",1
"I never look at gas prices. I'm a creature of convenience. This was our final stop before the airport's car rental return and it was convenient in that regard.\n\nI went inside and bought some snacks while hubby put a little fuel in the Nissan rental. Large, clean, well-stocked. But the counter service included no free smile as we paid our money. I'd received sad news earlier that day and I was still able to manage a sincere smile. It unfortunately went unreturned.\n\nI think sometimes people forget that their actions really affect others. Even if you're just a voice on a phone, you never know if patience rather than irritability might make a big difference to the person on the other end of the line. Especially true when in-person. Smiles are contagious. Well, usually...  :)",2
"Of course your average Starbucks fare is here, as at every place across the country. \n\nWhat sets an individual location of a chain like Starbucks apart is the quality of their service and the feel of the store. Both are subpar at this particular spot. Long lines out into the terminal because the store is understaffed, and that leads to abrupt, harried staff who in turn provide an unpleasant experience for the guests. \n\nThere are also unpacked boxes of inventory lining the walls. I know that your bakery items aren't actually fresh-baked, but I like to keep a little mystery alive as to how those pastries end up in the glass case.",1
"Nice place, the food was ok I had a sandwich which was slightly above a mediocre deli grade sandwich. Not impressed I heard good things about the food, but it's nothing to brag about. I did go in on a Sunday which was also 4th of July the service was great but the food not so much...",1
"I ate here for Valentines day it was sooooo busy. It was also our first time. We made reservations but it was like there was no point to make reservations because we still had to wait for 30 mins to get seated. When the waiter is there ask all the questions you need answered, Make sure you order enough sushi to get full, and ask for the check right when they give you your food because once he leaves he is going to take a lonnnnnnnnnnng time to come back, like another 20-30mins. My waiter was takashi. He was cool and nice. We ordered everything he recommended because we love surprises and trying things new so everything he recommended was delicious and the best. It was probably like that because it was a holiday like Valentines day. Just a heads up, if your planning on going here DON'T GO HERE ON A HOLIDAY!",1
"I used to come here with my dad all the time. However today our experience was not so pleasant. I do not appreciate your hostess rudely greeting not my father or myself but my knee to your restaurant this evening. Said hostess asked if I had a cut while I walked into your faculty and I replied with I just had surgery. She proceeded to stare at me as if I had twelve faces or was the ghost of Christmas past. We were seated and A woman rudely placed our chips and salsa down and asked if we were leaving.  Our server came and took our orders and was far from friendly. Our food came and the chimi platter I ordered was bland and my father's meal was atrocious looking. The meat was so runny, the rice was overly cooked and the beans were even mushier than the runny so called meat.  After we finished our less than perfect meals the same hostess whipped her head around the bar as if she were an owl to say her goodbyes to my leg. I quickly responded to her with the following statement \"" did you get a close enough look or would you like to take a picture?\"" She reponded with a \"" I was trying to say goodbye.\"" She also gave me one of the least sincere apologies I've ever heard. I've never felt so belittled by someone who didn't even speak and it would serve your restaurant right to teach your hostess some manners and proper authentic Mexican cooking skills you claim to have. Thanks. Regards. Kathryn Mindlin. I give you a -4 star rating.",0
Rice is rock hard.   Jaded chicken taste like its been sitting there for days.  Brought it to the young girls attention and they had to say was oh.  Plenty of people eating here but maybe they didn't get the rice?\nI think I may have just come to\nLate and there menu is to big for them to make it fresh when they order it.   Oh well. Plus they give you free chips and salsa for a good review on this.  Reason for all the stars on here? You decided but don't say I didn't warn you.    Maybe there chips are good and worth the stars.  Guess I'll never know,0
"Stayed at the Golden Nugget for a friend's b-day celebration and we wanted a really low key night, so Gold Diggers was suggested because, one: it's in the hotel we were staying in, and two: it's cheap and not pretentious. \n\nI like the look of the place, modern, fairly small, but everything is new and shiny. There is a patio overlooking Fremont St, a bar, and a dance floor. Lots of places to sit, which is good. (as we all know, a lot of places make you pay VIP to sit, but not Gold Diggers. Yay!) \n\nThere was such a mix of people there, it's hard to describe. Middle aged business men getting their groove on while away from the wifey, Young girls in groups just wanting to dance and not be bothered by dudes, Couples in love slow dancing to fast songs...The clientele is a lot more...diverse that it is on the strip, with all kinds of people, which kind of made it interesting...not all the cookie cutter types. (but if you are looking for glamour puss girls or metro guys, this is probably not your scene. No bouncer at the front picking and choosing who he wants to let in, which is awesome.) \n\nThe DJ spun a mix of 70's, 80's, 90's and Top 40. He changed the songs a little too soon for my taste, (Only got about 30 seconds of a song) but I guess everyone has ADD so that's how it has to be., lol...\n\nI would come here again if I wanted to dance and not worry about getting all swankified for the Strip. Very chill place to mingle and get your groove on.",2
"Will only visit this place if I'm comped.  What my party had to pay was more than $150 for 5 people.  The food was terrible and bland.  We had to wait over an hour to pay $150 for a meh experience.\n\nGo to the buffet at the Palms, 1/3 the price of this place and it is so much better!",1
To the barista that made my drink I saw you drop my cup and didn't give me a new one. Luckily I don't drink off of my rim that I wont complain and mess up your long line of drinks. Which btw wouldn't be so long if all your partners were actually working!!!,1
"Received an amazon local deal to this salon for my birthday.  Tried calling to set up an appointment and never received a call back.  Tried emailing (per the suggestion on their voicemail) and never received a response.  Finally showed up to their address and according to the Studio Salons listing they don't even have a spot there.  For those unfamiliar with Studio Salons, it's a large faculty that's subdivided into small independently owned salons that are like rooms within the large facility.  Each space can fit maybe 2-3 people at a time.  Anyway this one isn't listed there.  \n\nI plan to call Amazon to get the money back for the voucher but I see they are still advertising deals so I wanted to be sure to warn others not to purchase for this place.  From what I can tell it doesn't exist and assuming it does they don't ever return calls so it's impossible to make an appointment.  I also prefer to go to a larger salon where they have the space to cater to more than one person at a time.  The Studio Salon setup presents an awkward feel in my opinion.",0
"I feel Dorothy Perkins can be a hit or miss. It is like Topshop for older, dare I say frumpy, people. There is occasionaly some nice shoes or jewellery in here for a reasonable price, and the student discount is handy.\n\nHowever when I find clothing I like I am always disapointed to discover that the only sizes they seem to have a good stock of are sizes 14-18. Therefore I rarely buy clothing in here because the one or two things I do like, are not in my size.\n\nI would say that Dorothy Perkins style is better to suited to your mum anyway.",2
"Worst service ever. The waitress was rude during the entire time we were in the restaurant. My gf and I order few items on the menu including beef , chicken and pork.  The beef was pretty good. But the chicken was not good. So we couldn't finish it. Then we were about to leave, the waitress told was they were gonna charge us extra because we didn't finish our food( I was like wtf!??!?!) . I told her first you never told us. Second the chicken dish wasn't good.  Talked to the owner she apologized and didn't charge us extra.  But it was too late for that plus it was my gf bday. I own a restaurant too. This is not how customer service supposed to be. We left without any tip and leaving this review right away lol!",0
"I have been to Panera several times.  The broccoli cheese soup and french onion soup are the best,.  \n\nHowever, I have never had a good apple from Panera.  EVER.  They are always tasteless and thick skinned.  I am not sure where they get their apples from but it might not be bad idea to shop around and have someone with taste buds pick the apples.\n\nThe Sierra turkey is a really good Cafe sandwich but the onions on it are a bit hot and strong.  I picked them off. The Chipolte mayo was a little spicy but added great flavor to the sandwich. It comes on Asiago cheese focaccia which I probably would have picked a different bread. I have tried other sandwiches and I have liked most of them.\n\nI tried one of the new pasta dishes the other day and was not overly impressed.  But I am not a pasta person.\n\nI went through the drive through for the first time today and I was really impressed with how quickly I got in and out of it.  It seems you wait longer for you food when you dine in.",2
"My friend and I stayed here for Labor Day weekend.  The hotel is absolutely beautiful.  The decor is very contemporary and the architecture near the lobby is very interesting.  The rooms are clean and have adequate spacing.  However, WiFi nor continental breakfast is included (like it is at the Embassy Suites next door).  The hotel offers free WiFi for an hour during your stay AND the hotspot is located in the lobby!  I have to say, that made my stay inconvenient.  I have stayed in several hotels all over the United States both high end and not so high end, and they all came with free WiFi.  \n\nBottom line: Stay somewhere else, where all amenities are included with no additional fees!",1
"Checkin process was quick and easy. Lobby was lovely enough and clean. We got to our one bedroom suite late Friday (11:00) but upon setting up the pull-out, we found there were no extra sheets. We called down for some to be sent up. They told us they were doing laundry and would bring some up when they could. We knew they never would just by that answer so we pulled our extra top sheet and blanket off our bed to accommodate the kids. Sure enough, sheets were never brought. \n\nOn a positive note, I felt the room was clean and comfortable. We had a handicap room so the shower had an extra seat in it which made showering a little awkward. \n\nThe a.m continental breakfast was just ok. We got down there around 9:15, prime Sunday a.m rush only to find the hot food to have tasted like it had been sitting out for quite awhile. \n\nAt checkout, we told them about our sheet incident and they took 20$ off our bill without hesitation. I would also like to say, they spent 15 min the night we checked in, looking for a toothbrush for me!!",2
"TERRIBLE... Food sucks. Food is cold. I watched a worker scoop up chow mein people had dropped on counter from pan and put it back into the pan, disgusting. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. I was the idiot that still went to this place even after reading these reviews thinking it couldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong.",0
"A friend of mine wanted to meet up at the Sahara location and had to doublecheck she didn't mean the one that shutdown on Paradise.  I love tapas and I love Firefly but I don't want to sign up for food poisoning.\n\nWe ordered the bacon wrapped dates, fries, scallops escargot, empanada and baked tetilla.  I had 1 sangria and 2 sparkling white sangrias.  As always, food and drinks were amazing.  And I didn't get sick afterwards!\n\nHowever, out of all the Firefly locations in the Vegas area, this one has the worst service.  Our glasses would be left dry for a long time.  Nobody was there to check on us or make sure we have enough to drink.\n\nThe one in Anthem is much busier than this location yet the service there was sooo much better.",2
"If I could give them a rating with NEGATIVE five stars, I would do that.\n\nStrike 1.  When you pick up prescriptions, sometimes when the person helping you is at their computer at the middle island, they speak really loudly and ask you for your personal information to verify your identification.  You have to damn near yell out your answers, and everyone can hear you.  Do they not realize the concept of identity theft?\n\nStrike 2.  I dropped off my prescription at 11AM.  The pharmacist asked me what time I wanted to pick it up.  I told her 3PM.  I pulled up at the pick up window a little after 3PM.  Guess what?  It wasn't ready.  She said \""We got backed up..\""  She asked me to come back for it in 15 minutes.  I guess I should have just told them that I needed them ASAP and that I would wait in the store for my prescription.  \n\nStrike 3.  I brought back a prescription because it wasn't the \""cream\"" that they usually give me.  I explained to the pharmacist that this new one is more of a cream and my original medication was more of an ointment.  I also explained to him that the new one doesn't work for me because I tried it before and my skin just doesn't respond to it.  This guy was less than sympathetic.  On top of that, he seemed a little irritated that he may have to special order the item I needed.   He just looked at me with that \""Are you done?\"" look..  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe people that work in the store part of CVS are nice and helpful.  A couple of them are even sweet.\n\nDo you ever look at people while they're doing their job and think, \""this person shouldn't be in this line of work\""?  That's what I think of every single person that has ever \""helped\"" me at this CVS Pharmacy.",0
"It's been a while since I've had a Quizno's Sandwich.  Groupon had a deal and I bought a few of them, so I had to come here.  I had a regular Italian on Parmesan Bread w/Chips.  It was bleh....there was too much Dressing on the Sandwich and it overpowered the flavors.  Also, the Bread lacked flavor.  \n\nIf it wasn't for the Groupons, I wouldn't come back.\n\nReturn Factor - 20%",1
"Went to Blush with my boyfriend for something to do after leaving PNC. The cover was $15 each and they do in fact charge females a cover. The bartenders were really nice and made the drinks fairly strong and kept them coming.\n\nThe club really didn't have a lot of seating and the stage was kind of gross and scuffed up with a really low ceiling. There was a diverse group of girls but they weren't aggressive at all, and were fairly attractive. \n\nThe patrons were kind of rough and rowdy which really took away from the experience, but that might have been because of the huge influx of people coming in after the concert. I don't know that it is worth visiting again.",1
"This event has all the right ideas but doesn't quite logistically make sense to me.  \n\nThis was my first time attending after living in Charlotte my whole life.  I didn't have any expectations but the idea of getting to sample a ton of restaurants in the area sounded good to me!\n\nThe heat...didn't bother me....the people...didn't bother me...the quality of food...eh, didn't really bother me.\nBut, what DID bother me was the layout and the quality of vendors.  If you are claiming this is a TASTE of Charlotte then show me something worth tasting.  Hooters?  Salsaritas?  Costco?  Tons of bars and grills?  Come on.  I know there were a couple of good quality restaurants represented but to that point I agree with others that say the crowds are just out of control.  If you have to wait in a 2 hour line to get one of the 3 decent restaurants represented that it holds up the entire walkway..something is logistically wrong.  Maybe this should be held indoors at the convention center?  Maybe on a wider street?  I don't know but something wasn't working and you don't have to be an event planner to know that.\n\nThere was an element of class missing from the overall event in my opinion.  I felt like people would rather throw an elbow to get to the chicken wings than enjoy a stroll through yummy food lane.  \n\nOverall...I thought it was brutal.  Would I go back?  Probably not unless I saw that they stepped up the vendor list and that the layout was totally different.\n\n\n***on a positive note, I discovered Spice (in Concord) and they were great.  I love Indian food and am always looking for a new spot so I will give them a try in the near future",2
"First things first - Mexican food is something that I can love one day, and hate the next, so for my review I put on my unbiased hat and entered Mariachi's.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is how glad I was that I had booked ahead, as the moderatly sized restaurant was jam packed with customers and full of people looking hungry as they waited for a free table. So tip one - book!\n\nThat aside, the traditional mexican music that is barely audable above the hubbub of diners and the neutral decor lends a relaxed atmosphere and the margaritas we had while waiting in the bar area was second to none.\n\nThe menu is jam packed with traditional mexican and tex-mex foods, but we had to wait a little while for our orders, and the food was basic and according to my dining partner, the fajitas were bland.\n\nThat said, Mariachi's is smack bang in the middle of the city, and is always going to be busy with its trade from tourists - so the atmosphere is great, even if the food is a little uninspiring.",1
Ate here for the first time last night. My husband and I were meeting some friends for dinner before a concert and we picked this place to meet at. \nIn my opinion I think the prices are kind of high for what you get. \nMy husband and I are on a bit of a budget right now so we choose to split a taco plate.\nThe tacos were decent and the sopapillas that come with the meal were good. \nThe restaurant is very nice and our server was extremely nice and helpful. \nI probably wouldn't go back as I can get cheaper and better Mexican food elsewhere and also I don't live in the Glendale area.\n \nThe place is definitely good for large groups.\n\nOur server and free sopapillas was the best part of the experience.,1
"My first experience at Monta wasn't very good despite all the gleaming reviews I've read. The tonkatsu ramen tasted slightly gamy and was way too salty. I gave them another shot and it was a lot better. Gone was the gamy flavor of the broth. It was good but not amazing, in my opinion. Not the kind of broth you want to drink up. The chashu pork had a slightly smoky flavor and was OK. The nice wait staff and the cheap ramen help me see the attraction to this place. However, compared to other ramen places, I don't believe Monta's ramen stands out in presentation and flavor.",2
"You're not going to get sick here, but it isn't very good. \n\nFast, expensive, and close to gambling, who needs anything else? We were stuck needing food about 10 pm at Circus Circus and this was open. Overpriced by alot, the salsa was good, everything else was boring or flavorless. But it was food and we didn't have to drive somewhere else.",1
"I struggle with this review.  I have been to B21 a couple times for the turkey club - almost always a delicious burger unless the cook burns the crap out of one side and still serves it!  (That only happened one time though).  So I will say the food deserves 3 stars.  However, everytime I order this artisan burger the bun is a veritable hockey puck.  Inedible!!!   So, in the spirit of eating healthier I just toss the bun aside and eat the turkey patty (yum!)! \n\nThe 2 stars are for the cleanliness of the place.  It's slow most times that I go and the bar with the drinks and sauces is disgusting.  Additionally, the floors are just as gross.  \n\nI agree with everyone - overpriced food.",1
"We tried this burger place for the first time a few years ago after receiving a dinner voucher following a timeshare presentation. We remember the food being really good and have returned each time we were in town. The burgers were always cooked perfectly. My favorite had always been the mahi mahi burger, although the coleslaw has become dry and bland over the years. The service is always friendly although the efficicency is a hit and miss. The last couple times we have found the food quality and portions to have gone down. It is difficult to sell a $10 and up burger without fries and drink to the average person on vacation, especially if the portions and quality are  undeserving. I am sure their business will continue due to being in a good location and having tourists as the main clientele. Good thing they are not starving for return customers. We sadly no longer have this place on our \""must visit\"" list each trip.",2
"Another great downtown coffee shop. They have a nice outdoor patio and a cozy section in the back with couches and armchairs. They also have local musicians play some nights which can be quite enjoyable. The coffee and atmosphere are pretty good. Seating can be a little sparse and when it's crowded, it can be a bit hard to move around.\n\nI don't have any complaints really, but Aroma doesn't quite have the draw for me that other downtown coffee shops have.",2
"Love love the product. But the horrible experience with the staff one afternoon ruined it for me. My friend and I had stopped in for drinks the wait was long which is understandable, but the immaturity of the staff went beyond normal high school kids working a part time job. After waiting for our drinks while watching the boy, who was supposed to be making one of them goof off ..walking around..in the back room.. Around the register..we finally got one drink, we ask for the 2nd and were told we didn't have another I had to show my receipt, then told they were out of an ingredient for the drink. Even though they were making the very same drink for another customer. I got my money back from a now apologetic employee. The boy behind the counter then started to argue and act belligerent towards my friend and dropped the F bomb. She called the DM, who a couple weeks later sent her a gift card. I'm not one to write reviews if something bad happens I move on but the one and only time my friend returned there the boy that swore at her was still working there . I will say that I have saved money over the last few months since that happened by buying my own juicer.",0
"I wavered between two and three stars.  I think truthfully this is a 2.5 star place.   Nothing totally objectionable or inedible, but just not my bag.  I've been to Brixx up in Birkdale and I remember liking my salad.  I was brand new to the area and my Realtor took me there one day after looking at apartments.  Maybe I was too focused on apartment hunting to remember it clearly, but I remember liking my salad from Birkdale.\n\nI've eaten at the uptown place twice.  Both on Saturday nights while partaking in the free trivia they offer.  Four stars for trivia, but I digress.  The first time I had a salad and bread sticks.  The bread sticks were weird.  Not a fan and I love anything vaguely resembling dough!  The salad was unremarkable.  Not good, not bad, just kinda average.  I've had better salads at Panera.  Anywho, I tried a pizza the 2nd time.  Again it was just meh, I've had some frozen pizzas that were better.  But in the same vein I've had way worse experiences.    \n\nWill I return to Brixx in uptown....sure, I love me some trivia.  But I may just drink (responsibly of course!)....don't know that I'll try the food b/c it just doesn't blow me away and both times I came away sightly disappointed.\n\nShout out to my server from the last time - wish I could remember her name.  Well, Brixx validates parking and somehow I lost my ticket. I went back to the garage and attempted to pull a ticket on foot, but damn garage ticket dispensers are smart.  They won't dispense a ticket w/o sensing a car is present.  Anyway I asked my server what Brixx could do b/c I was genuinely afraid of how I'd get my car out past the gates. My server gave me her ticket, validated and everything.  That was beyond.  Maybe she was conning me to get a bigger tip, but I don't care...I made sure she was taken care of.  I think my bill was $13 or so for my pizza, but I tipped her an extra $5.  She was the bomb.\n\nETA - Ok I changed my review from 2 stars to 3 b/c my server was awesome.  She went above and beyond.  It appears as if management reads these reviews so I really wish I remembered her name b/c she deserves kudos.  Maybe they'll figure it out/remember me (it was the night of the big Bruce Springsteen concert across the street at Time Warner).  If not, well all I can say is the service is always great and for that I'll fondly remember Brixx in uptown.",2
"Absolute Joke! There is no management  company here & the owner is inaccessible, have put up with plumbing, A/C, parking and numerous other problems since day one. Raw sewage floating down the sidewalk, tub & toilets won't drain. Gates are locked from the inside..isn't that against the fire code? Manager is well meaning but often unavailable and not given the tools to do his job. Pool is a wreck for weeks at a time and all common areas are filthy, rarely cleaned or maintained. Any work done is done without notice so it's common to have jackhammers, noxious fumes and the like start at any time of the day.\n\nDO NOT RENT HERE - stay away. I am moving out the minute my lease is up.\n\nI didn't list a phone number because on the website there is conveniently no contact number???",0
"Wo Fat, how I wanted to love you!\n\nMany of my Hawaiian friends say this is real Chinese-Hawaiian food.  Maybe my problem is that I always go expecting the Chinese food that I grew up with (New York style).\n\nThe staff is friendly.  The restaurant itself is a whole in the wall.  It isn't as clean as I would like but it isn't gross...\n\nThe prices are very reasonable.\n\nMy problem is just that the food isn't what I, expecting and therefore doesn't taste right to me.\n\nI'm giving it three stars, but if you are judging it as a Chinese Hawaiian restaurant it may be worth more stars.",2
"I can only comment on what I experienced during our night time visit for \""the Gauntlet\"" haunted house. We had purchased a combo ticket for the haunted house and spooky golf. We have only recently moved here and didn't know our way around and the signs weren't clear of where to go. Having visited the restroom first, I found it to be disgusting with an overflowed toilet and water on the floor. Quickly leaving that area we had to ask around to find the haunted house. It was well done for the space used and I have no compliant about that. Once done with the haunted house we went to get our golf clubs and proceeded to what we thought was the golf course. We didn't know where to go so picked one of two- called the Princess. Really tough course and I wondered where all of the decorations were. Once done the crazy course we came across the one we expected to play on- the spooky one but had no signs leading to it. I complained about it and was told \""we don't tell people about the spooky one unless they ask and if we wanted to play we can pay extra\"".\nNo apologies and really- no signs?? \nHad to visit the restroom again before leaving and found it to be functioning but disgusting still. Note to parents- bring hand sanitizer and eat elsewhere as the food looked awful as well.",1
This place is not good at all. The only thing that is good is the chips and salsa (which they charge for). Ordered a Michelada and anyone who knows what a Michelada is knows that it doesn't consist of Lime juice and salt with a beer. The food was bland as well. Definitely not coming back here and I'm not recommending this place at all.,0
"I was absolutely STOKED when I heard that this food establishment was just a couple hundreds of yards away when I checked into the MGM on Friday. I have been eyeing 'Wichcraft for a while now b/c there is one located next to Bloomindale's in SF, and I am the biggest fan of Top Chef on Bravo, plus, Esther Gertrude (my mother) allllllllllllllways raves about the hot turkey sandwich...so yeah, hands down, I was READY from the craftily made sandwiches for Friday's lunch. \n\nWell....for $10, I was a little underwhelmed with my roasted pork pannini. Something just didn't taste right....I tried some Tabasco; nope. Then some ketchup; sorta helped. I washed everything down with my Vegas priced Corona Light ($6), which sorta ameliorated the situation b/c it gave me a slight buzz...haha. \n\nAnyway, there aren't a lot of quick-bite options on Studio Walk, but for $10, I could have gotten a couple of happy meals at McDonald's across the way.",2
"Personally, I would never rent from this junky junk car rental place again, but I get why people do.  Like I've said, my time is valuable, so I'm willing to pay what I've got to pay to a point. I do love value though and I will say, price was the driving force for the decision from jump, but you get what you pay for. In the end, it made for comic relief, because you really don't get to see this type of thing anywhere. \n\nWe got some sort of newish Ford that had 58K miles on it. This babe-magnet has seen a day or two in the Vegas heat. It was a ropey little thing. My man said it was like Barney Rubble was underneath the hood. So funny! \n\nThe main pain in the arse though, was returning the car. O! M! to the G! Why was it so disorganized? It took like 45 minutes to check out. No distinguishable lines. Who's renting a car? Who's returning a car? Total chaos. To the point you're looking at people who work there who aren't helping customers and saying to yourself \""wtf? can you help me?\"" It was like being at what I assume a welfare office would be like.  It was unreal. \n\nThe \""airport shuttle\"" was another bag of fun. Finally we get on the shuttle, and the driver randomly drops off two korean ladies in sun hats off at CVS. What? It was like a bad movie! Without missing a beat, we are back rolling again.  We pull up to what looks like some sort of station, to be told to get off, go across the street, find someone with a green vest, who will then tell us which shuttle to get onto for the airport. Are you joking? I couldn't stop laughing. \n\nIt's cheap because you pay for it in stress. Which eventually turns into laughing, it's so unorganized and crazy.",1
"Good basic car wash location\nTERRIBLE DETAILING SERVICE\n\nDanny's provides a good basic car wash service. Exterior wash and interior vacuum and wipe for $12.99. Unfortunately their detailing services are terrible and a complete  ripoff. For $150.00 you get the same thing you get for a $12.99 wash. Danny's service personnel will discount the detailing service to $130 after you say NO the first time. Once you commit expect to get a phone call from the detailer trying to convince you that you need to spend an additional $80 for clay grit removal and polishing. After 2 hours your car will look the same as it did after you take it through the $12.99 basic wash. The big pieces will be clean but all the corners will be dirty. They will vacuum the big spots and your mats but the corners and areas under and around your seats will be left untouched. The exterior will be washed but all the corners, edges and all the areas you expect to be 'detailed' will be dirty. Your wheels will be clean on the large surface areas but all the edges and corners of the wheels will be dirty. \n\nSpend the $12.99 for a decent car wash bout don't get ripped-off spending an extra $100 for what they call detailing.",0
"Yes, I went all the way to Las Vegas to have pho when there's a shop on pretty much every corner in my neighborhood.  About half the group wanted to try the pho and the other half wanted food from the coffee shop.  We were told that if we put our order in at the coffee shop we could order from both menus.  \n\nI ordered pho ga.  I noticed they had a Vietnamese sandwich on the menu too.  I was pretty hungry, so I went in on that with a friend.  The pho, as I expected was ok, nice broth, tender pieces of chicken etc.  The sandwich was the stand out of the meal.  The bread was crusty, the pork was smokey and flavorful.  I would definitely get that again. \n\nI will note that ordering from both menus slowed down the arrival of our food to the table.  I heard something about coordinating both kitchens.  So I wouldn't try this if you're in a hurry.",2
"This place is gross. I can see if I had a kid or 7, it would be some decent fun. But Idk, I went with a girl, and I could tell she thought the idea was cute and novel but would have much rather gotten coffee or something. I just felt germs on me, and the food here is for kids only, because they don't know any better. They to update everything and hire some new folks who can still smile and have fun with their job.",1
"We stayed here for my girlfriends bachelorette in 2004.  Rooms were clean, bed was comfy. Pool area was nice.  Hardly in the room anyways so basically not much negative to say about it. Price was decent.  We all enjoyed our stay here being it was the best location on the strip.",2
"Went to dinner tonight and it was different  from every other experience I have ever had at Pig & Pickle. This was just upsetting. The server didn't have much time for our table and actually let us know that. The food was good as usual, but the service ruined my night. I'm disappointed. Worst birthday dinner ever.",1
"Totally unreliable and overpriced, pre booked a cab with discount to the airport for an early morning flight. Rang to confirm three hrs prior to pick up time and dispatch confirmed booking. But cab never showed. Rang dispatch and was told it was 10 mins away. Rang again after 15 mins and she told me she was trying to find someone to do the run. Obviously lied to me during my first call. She sounded like she was on Meth or something. I rang another company who showed up immediately and charged 15 dollars less than I was quoted by discount. I could have missed my flight. Save yourself this hassle and use another cab company",0
"I feel as though this place deserves maybe two and a half stars... it really wasn't that bad- it just wasn't that good either. \n\nCame for dinner with my husband. The only reason is we got into a conversation with one of the managers while we were gambleing at a hotel up the strip. He told us to go in and tell them he sent us for a round of drinks on the house. Sounded like a good idea so we went. I had margaritas, which were pretty standard tasting- nothing super exciting.  \n\nWe did have a table with a nice veiw of the strip so we were able to people watch (always entertaining in Vegas) \n\nThe food was decent. Again, nothing super exciting. Hubby had wings which were tasty and I had a chicken burrito. I enjoyed the one wing I stole from him and the chicken burrito was actually pretty tasty- though nothing about it was anything out of the ordinary.\n\nThe only thing that freaked me out? going into the ladies room to find a little woman lurking in the corner with an assortment of toiletries spread on the counter and a tip bowl for when she hands you a paper towel. Um. Random. I am perfectly capable of getting my own paper towel. And no, I will not tip you for that \""service\"".",1
The place sucks.  I don't care if a commie or socialist or nazi eats there.\n\nThe owners are what concerns me most.\n\nI enjoyed the food the first time but when I ready they had the ass't governor holding some fricking prayer service there I was through.\n\nI don't care what any businesses politics are BUTT I don't want to hear or read about them.,0
"An overall good place, but a few bad experiences here. The music gets marginally more annoying each and every visit here. Kareoke jams sang on pianos, which can be fun at times, but eventually you need some real jams to wet your whistle. Drinks are normally priced, and it is usually pretty crowded. One of the bartenders confronted my friend for not tipping enough, which pretty much turned me off to the place (there are 2 bars where he had tabs, and he had tipped at the first one but not the second). The dude was really rude about it too. Overall I will agree with those who love the place, I can see why, but its not the best to frequent imo.",2
"First let me start by saying - for a climate like ours, this town is lacking the good old classic ice cream stops. This place is just that. First - location is great for those that live or work downtown. Second- the hours are great, while there may be better frozen treats in the downtown area, this place is more accessible because it is open when you want to go. Second the ice cream is really good - just the classic good stuff that you want on a Friday night or a Monday afternoon (aka anytime of the day). My only bad comment - is that while the ice cream cookie sandwiches are good (good ice cream + tasty cookies), I wish they were made fresh to order. Because they sit in the freezer the cookies get cold and the ice cream becomes air dried. \n\nAll in all - good place to go when you just want a good old fashioned scoop of ice cream.",2
"BBQ chicken salad was different, but very delicious, but the service was(how to explain) unsatisfactory. I was enjoying my plate and attempting to finish it all. The server comes around the corner and asks if I was done. I did not have half a second to answer and he just took the plate from the table. I was very shocked! I felt as he hated his job and so did the other male servers around the restaurant. My experience here was not enjoyable! I'd go to any other restaurant in town square, but this one ever again.",1
"When I had arrived I got access card to a wrong room, after trying to get into my room on the 3rd floor when it was 115F - I went down again the lady gave me the correct card to the room, she admitted she made a mistake, I get inside it was so hot I turn the AC get into the shower, the AC is not working, I get down they send the handy man he did fix it but it took another half a hour until the room cooled off. The next day I need to check out at 12 noon time at 10am the maid tried to get into my room I told her I am not leaving yet, at 10:45 am another call from the front desk when I am leaving I told them I will extend my saying for 2 hours extra, I was told it will cost me $20.00 and I have to pay in cash. I got to down town got something to eat tried to get into my room the card is not working, I need to pay prior, OK, I had paid I tried to get into the room, the access card is not working again, I go down get another card, the front desk lady confused my room number. Finally at 2pm I check out, they will not allow you to leave your belonging in the lobby, nor there is a rest room there. The breakfast was OK; the lady who served was very friendly. The only good thing is the location (walking distance to down town- Scottsdale), breakfast and the pool!!!",1
"I come to this Starbucks every day, thru the drive thru. And everyday they can never hear me, so I'm always repeating at least twice. I order the same drink every day, 8 times out 10, it tastes different. Same drink just something is always off day after day. So frustrating. The other HUGE deal, the drive thru is a ridiculous wait! Whether it be 3 cars or 10, give yourself at least 10 min to get thru the line, at least! \nUp here in southern Highlands there isn't a lot to choose from, with anything but I can guarantee if there was a coffee bean next store, I'd be there!",1
Bad service don't count on your reservation to be fulfilled. Horrible service. The workers acted as if they are above there guest because they work there! Someone needs to remind them they serve fried chicken. They are no better then someone who works at KFC!!! The manager is rude. The server did not want to split checks and turned mad when we asked him to do so. Tip: if you work in the hospitably business be hospitable! Prefer the location on Bethany home!!!!,0
"I really wanted to like this place, it looked so promising.  Three of us went on Sunday afternoon using a coupon for a free entree.  The best part of the meal was the pesto & garlic butter which came with the basket of bread.\n\nI could not decide what to get and the waitress recommended the house made Tortellini with ricotta and marinated in marinara and alfredo sauce, she said it was not heavy.  Well, it was over heavy and I could not taste the Tortellini because it was swimming in the sauce which tasted not very good.  I sent it back.  We also ordered the Lasagna with meatballs which was swimming in marinara sauce and also was just average nothing to rave about.  Also ordered the Penne Caprese - beware of this - it is very very spicy and will burn your mouth if you are not prepared....also the balsamic vinegar on the top does not work well with this dish.  After I sent my Tortellini back, I wanted to try something else to give them the benefit....I ordered the Portabella Penne not real sure why it is called this as there are no mushrooms in it....this was in-edible....not able to eat loaded with garlic, I love garlic eat it everyday, this tasted like it was drenched in white wine and they used the whole bag of garlic - everyone at the table tried it and no one could eat it........we also ordered the breaded ravioli's for an appetizer...could not taste the ravioli because the bread was too thick......the meatball are very heavy and I did not like them, more like rocks than meatballs and a little on the spicy side..\n\nLike I said in the beginning the best part of the meal was the Butter in the Bread Basket.........We were also disappointed that they sell Atlantic Salmon which is farm raised and loaded with chemicals, toxins and bacteria, all Atlantic Salmons is farm raised but they did not seem to know this, go figure...\n\nthe decor is real nice and the booths were very comfortable.  The do have a gluten free menu and gluten free pizza - so we might come back for the gluten free pizza and maybe on a different day as Sunday maybe they were slacking or something, the manager is a Lady and does not smile much, if when you smile at her.",0
Typical overpriced Vegas fancy pants restaurant.\n\nPistachios to begin with.... ok. I'll eat them but it's still off.\n\nWhat did I eat again? I can barely remember because it was that forgettable (paired with the excessive drinking).\n\nLet me look the menu up online:\n\nPate- typical pate. it was good. nothing special.\n\nGnocchi- by far best dish of the night. Puffy little hot pockets of fluffy potato. Wow. I couldnt get enough!\n\nWe shared something else but I don't see it on the menu and I remember none of us liked it anyways... so better for the restaurant that we don't remember.\n\nThe place itself reminds me of a cafeteria. Also they don't serve bread plates because it's picnic style or some crap like that. There were crumbs everywhere!,2
"Horrible service department! I'm new to the Toyota brand, all my past experience has been with German companies, so I'm not sure if this is normal with Toyota, but I feel the diagnosis they provided was not correct as many of they things they advised were just done.  This alone still would not have given me reason enough to write a bad review, however on top of that the service is just poor.  Fortunately its an extra vehicle so I could just leave it there.  I really don't even want to deal with these people. One of these days I'll get the energy to go back and deal with the wait times and poor service, but for now my 4runner can sit there.",0
The place is pretty clean the people are really friendly service I see you at the some of the stuff is really overcooked and the sushi is really dry other than that it's pretty good service is just I have experience better buffets but maybe it's just because it's so late in the evening and in the weekend I am going to come back and try it again a second time and see how things change and then I will do a update.,1
"I would give this place no stars if I could. Sat at the counter thinking we could grab a quick bite. The place wasn't packed, a few customers but by no means busy. Sat there for about 5 minutes, no menus, no \""hey, be with you in a sec,\"" not even eye contact as they walk right in front of you! Literally, 3 servers walked right past us as if we weren't even there. The manager and a server stood by the cash register (which is probably 5 feet from where we were sitting) and talked to each other the whole time. Needless to say, we got up and walked out.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go eat at the Sundance Grill in the same casino. The burgers there are awesome and you'll probably get served in this lifetime.",0
"I heard so many recommendations for this location, so I decided to go on a weekday night. The place was empty, so we got seated very quickly. They had some specials on the menu, but we went with the recurring entr\u00e9es.\n\nWe got an appetizer, the bacon-wrapped scallops; they were good, but it came with only 4 pieces. I thought the food was mediocre. My grilled Reuben sandwich was flavorful, but the cheddar chicken was just okay.\n\nI wouldn't pay this much for this food again. \n\nI made a mistake and did not try steak here, which I am told is devine. I might go back and try the steak, but probably nothing else.",2
"Excellente! Definitely worth checking out.  Their salads are great, too!\n\nOh, and I did list \""outdoor seating\"" but really it's just the curb out front, and you have all of these cars driving by, so it's not really all that comfortable...unless you like the smell of exhaust fumes, that is. ;)",2
Drove by a hundred times and saw the reviews here on Yelp and figured I'd give it a try.  Best I can compare it to would be a poor imitation of a Filaberto's.  Neither of us finished our food & not because we were served huge portions.  I won't be back but I guess I'm in the minority here.,1
"I expected more from the reviews. Basic nail salon with the usual grungy corners and communication problems. 40 minute Pedi for $35. No bargain. Broken chair massage for a couple of us. A few of the girls were friendly but for our 4 person group no one was dying to run back there.  Gotta love a \""spa\"" where the staff pops a squat outside and lights up before you've even driven away. Save the trip.",1
"Every time I decide to get lunch from M&S, I think I'm in for a treat, and then by the time I get here I've remembered that they don't make nearly as many different sandwiches as they used to and what they DO make is pretty... meh.  \n\nThey used to have great wraps, avocado sandwiches, brie and grape, tasty tastiness.  In the place of the tasty tastiness they have lots and lots and lots of pasta salad type things.  Now I realise I just listed avocado and brie as sandwich choices but have you SEEN the health information on those pasta salads??  They're like, 2/3 of your daily intake.  That's narsty.\n\nAdditionally, the lines in here can be incredible.  Points for the staff for dealing with it quickly, but man at lunch it's absolutely ridiculous.  \n\nSo... I'm just really not that keen on M&S anyway, but poor lunch selection paired with ridiculous lines makes this place 2 stars at lunch time and 3 stars the rest of the time.",2
"One of the better Learn to swim facilities but still needs improvement.\n\nAt 9 months it was time for my little dude to get acclimated with swimming. After searching around and visiting a few swim schools in town, this location was one of the better schools.\n\nI found getting into classes that suited my time schedule wasn't to hard but being flexible to move to another day or missing a class and making it up was extremely difficult. \n\nAfter a few months of attending water wings my son had to miss a few weeks as being out of town etc, the school offers you a make up class as they require you to pay monthly, unfortunately if you cannot make up the class you will still be charged for the classes. I had two weeks in a row where I cancelled the class with fair notice, because we we're out of town we could not make up the class yet they still charged full price.\n\nThe classes were great, my son really loved the instructor Amber. She was fantastic and i would  recommend her for any level or age group.\n\nA negative about this swim school is they let the kids play around after there classes in the walk in section. I'm ok with it, but a lot of the kids in classes are distracted by the other kids playing and no longer engage into there class. Unfortunately this is one of the reasons I had to pull my son out,as the whole class he and other kids wanted to play.\n\nThe front desk girls are ok but on occasions can be extremely rude to customers, although they were nice to me, I did see it on a few occasions with others.",2
"We never actually tasted the food because we walked in and no one spoke to us. We found someone walking by and they told us to sit anywhere. The five tables along the wall when you walk in were disturbingly dirty. Dishes covered the tables, and on the floor were half eaten chicken wing bones. It was appalling. We stood and waited for almost 20 minutes for someone to clean the tables, but this didn't happen. After 30 minutes, we finally left. No one had spoke to us nor had they cleaned any of the tables. I can't comment on their food, but if their establishment is this vile, imagine the kitchen.",0
"The place is literally a combat zone in the evenings.  So packed with people it's impossible to keep clean.  A steamy, dishroom atmosphere pervades the place.  Most of the help are of questionable US citizenship.  The food reminds me of a USMC chow hall on a bad day.  I'll give this place 2 stars for one reason:  They give vets a free meal on Veterans Day.",1
Stay away from this place.  We got bottle service for a friend's bachelor party and they switched the table we booked for an inferior one and we had to pay an extra $1k. They were acting extremely dishonest the wheel time. Avoid this host Kevin and his underling Josh. \n\nThe night afterwards was OK but I have had much better experiences at marquee and XS. Will not be coming back period.,0
"I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the high volume of staff to keep things moving.  It was busy, but the service remained fast and friendly regardless of the high volume of people there.\n\nWhat I didn't love was the salad and the lack of discussion about what I was ordering.  They prepared me a small salad, I wanted a large but couldn't tell what they were doing.  Once I realized it was a small it was too late.  Also, the added items (chicken, egg, tomato, etc) was WAY too small of a serving for a lunch.  I was less than two bites of chicken - maybe 1-2ounces total..  and about 1/4 of a hard-boiled egg.  I'm not a big eater - but I was pretty hungry when I left the restaurant.  Also - WAY too much dressing - it was drowning in dressing.\n\nThey were so focused on keeping the line moving (and I understand they need to get people through at lunchtime), but they didn't take enough time to let me make decisions about my order.  Large salad, not small.  Extra chicken please.  LESS dressing, etc.  \n\nIt could  be great if they improved the service at the counter and actually gave people a moment to order what they want... and if they consider actually adding a decent serving of ingredients to the salads.",1
"Stay here if you like:\n\n* Homogenized, cookie cutter people.\n* Fake body parts:  Chins, breasts, hair\n* Reruns of MTVs The Grind.\n* SPRING BREAK, WHOO!\n* Frat parties.\n* Paying too much just so you could say you've been there.\n* Nice enough rooms, but, again, far too expensive.\n* Roofies.  Ecstacy.  GBH.  Other horrible mind altering substances.\n* Lack of conversation.\n* Groping and/or being groped.\n* Top 40 music.\n* Camera crews shooting for made-for-cable shows and gettin' all in your way.\n\nI kinda have a lot of disdain for this place, the type of people who flock here, and the amount of money they charge to be surrounded by these people.  The theatres are OK as is the margarita brunch.  The rest of it could fall off the world and I wouldn't care.",1
"Worst place ever. How can a Mexican feel so out of place at a Mexican restaurant? Food was awful. Chile verde was cold and tasted from a can, chiminga was a hard greasy tortilla full of \""meat\""?  The waiter ignored us the whole time while he attended to other \""white\"" guest. Our \""movie nite\"" got cancelled because we had to run home because we got shits. Never going back again!",0
"We made a reservation for 14 people for a birthday dinner the night before we went, but they didn't even take down our reservation and we had to wait an HOUR AND A HALF on a Thursday night. The girl just kept making excuses about how no one told her about the reservation and suggested if we want to stand up off to the side and eat our food there. CMON, really? just chill off to the side and eat while standing for a birthday dinner? Who even thinks of these kinds of things? We finally got seated a quarter after 10, and the food wasn't even worth our wait. They recently changed their pizza menu, and got rid of the BBQ pizza. I ordered 3 different pizzas to share with a friend, and only one was worth paying for. Marguerita pizza was good, bacon&eggs and genovese were not. They were so salty and the bacon&eggs had only one egg on it. Also, the egg yolk was hard, not runny, like the pizzas I saw on other people's plates. So conclusion is, I probably wouldn't go here for weekday late nights anymore, and the new menu sucks. Not to mention their service. I thought they would at least bring us a free pitcher of juice or something for making us wait an hour and a half after making a reservation. But nope.",0
"I usually give nice reviews.\n\nI understand the issues of a new, start-up restaurant.\n\nI know that Bink's will figure out that they need a few compelling menu items...as the limited offering, at this stage of the game, is odd. (After close scrutiny, there was nothing that 'spoke' to me on the menu.  I order an appetizer for my entr\u00e9e.)\n\nPortions were small...and made even smaller by the tiny plate the food was served on.\n\nThe \""NEVER AGAIN\"" was a result of the manager...and the server...under-estimating my intelligence and experience.\n\nI ordered a Stoli martini.  No Stoli...so I changed it to Kettle.  No special instructions..other than I wanted it stirred not shaken...I hate ice chips and a watery drink. \n\nFive minutes later, a frothing, bubbling, smoking drink was served to me.  There was 1/8 of an inch of hard ice underneath the smoke produced by either dry ice...or ???  It was a drink some schmuck would order on a cruise ship.\n\nI asked the manager...who was strolling around... to take the drink back...and please give me a straight Kettle..up.  Another five minutes goes by, and, supposedly, a new drink was delivered.\n\nI noticed that the vodka was very, very cold.  Having consumed thousands of \""up\"" martini's, I have a good idea of how cold vodka can get when stirred in a shaker over ice.  This drink was much, much colder than I have ever had before.  \n\nI also observed that there was a definite line on the rim of the glass that was obviously where the ice had formed from the stupid drink they first served.  I asked the manager...and the server...if they had just scrapped the top off the first drink and re-served it.\n\n\""Oh no...We dumped the first drink and made you a fresh one!\""\n\nThat my dear reader, is a fib.  When further questioned, the server said, \""Well...we used the same glass from the first drink...and made you a new one. That's why the line was on the rim\""\n\nIn my humble opinion...They didn;t tell the truth.  What I believe they did...was scrape the ice off the first drink and delivered it back to me.  I would bet $500.00 that was what happened.\n\nSo...I will never return.  The food, service, etc., was fine considering the new opening of this place.  The fact that the manager and the server thought I was dumb enough to NOT KNOW a real martini from a screwed up first drink, INSULTED MY INTELLIGENCE.\n\nI guess I wish them good luck, however, I would never return and will take every opportunity to trash the place for the fib I believe I was expected to buy.  \n\nBetter hurry...as they can;t last long.\n\nRule 1...NEVER, EVER go cheap.  If the first drink was not right...make me a new one in a clean glass.",0
Of all the food experiences while staying at the palazzo this was the worst. Staff seemed to be rushing us and then we couldn't find them. Next thing we knew they were closing down and it was still early. Seems when the last game is over they shut it down. Tried again another night to go down for a drink and it was already closed as well. Food was mediocre and not something I'd rec. good place to watch a game (when they're on) and there is a sports book desk if you want to bet but I'd eat elsewhere and get here early.,1
"This was my choice for lunch to go last Wednesday.  I have been in this location at least a dozen times.  It always seems to be pretty busy (and noisy).  Today I chose the Sweet Fire chicken and the Honey Walnut shrimp, both items are not on their standard menu.  As usual I got the chow mein with mine, it is easier to eat with chop sticks than rice.  The food and service were fine and I was definitely full when finished.",2
"The people in the valley have become too use to bad food. Their taste buds are non exsistant. I'm a pastry student, no not going to work in Az after graduation, so I couldn't care less about how popular this company is. A friend brought me some cupcakes from this place, with the exception of the dark chocolate cupcakes, they were NASTY. the coconut cupcakes tasted like flour; the strawberry had no taste; they were dense and heavy. A friend of mine, who has an iron stomach, had severe stomach pains. I'm not trying to be mean, but every single person that I gave a cupcake to, hated them. When my friend told me the price of a dozen, I almost choked on my tongue. These people are marketing gods if they can get people to think that they have quality product",0
"It was good. It wasn't outrageously great, but it wasn't horrendously bad. \n\nI ordered the Turkey & Rosemary Omelet and my boyfriend ordered the French Toast Strata. \n\nMy meal came with an omelet, oven-roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. While everything was good, I have to say that I probably could have made the meal at home. If I go back, I wouldn't not eat this again, but I would definitely like to try something from their lunch selection first. My boyfriend was pretty much in agreement there. While he said his meal was good, he wants to try their burgers. \n\nThey have a nice size menu filled with lots of veggie and lean meat dishes, which are perfect for me. However, they also cater to my boyfriend's style with such dishes like the Wisconsin Pride Burger (cheese curds and bacon on top of a 1/2 lb burger). \n\nWe actually went their for breakfast for my boyfriends birthday. With that in mind, we left with a cupcake (I passed; too full to even think about cupcakes). My boyfriend chose the carrot cupcake with cream cheese frosting and walnut bits sprinkled on top. He wolfed it down and said it was good. \n\nI may update this review after we go for lunch sometime.",2
---------DINNER ONLY------\nKicked off a work event with my co-workers here. The food was good but it wasn't memorable. It's loud and a great place to get together with friends (typical Vegas place). It's inside the Cosmo hotel on the floor with all the other restaurants. All the restaurants seem to have waits but this one never does. It's an okay place but I'd probably try another restaurant before coming back here,2
"By far the worst place to live in all of Phoenix/Arizona. I would NEVER recommend anyone to live at this apartment complex. The parking is ATROCIOUS as they NEVER have parking spots available past 8pm. There is no street parking, so if you cannot find a spot you are SOL. The managament is the WORST that I have ever dealt with, as they take FOREVER in assessing any fees or fines. I moved out in 2010 and received a fee in 2012 for a \""cleaning\"" that they needed to do, even though they signed us out of the apartment and have other tennets living in the apartment that I occupied. \nThe management, especially Lisa Nolle, are EXTREMELY unprofessional and are as rude as can be. They are never clear on what they are charging you for and they could care less about any problem that you are having. All they are interested in is your money, not your well being. If they cared about me half as much as they care about my money, I'd never move out. Let me just say, not living at this apartment anymore is the BEST thing that's ever happened to me.\nI would not recommend anyone to live here. It's a waste of money and is a terrible apartment complex. There are 50 other places that I would recommend to live. There is NOTHING around this apartment complex (food, entertainment, etc.), so living here is like living in an annex. \nDo yourself a favor and DO NOT live here.",0
"Lets just make this short and sweet... I only come to Zia if I cant find what I'm looking for at Stinkweeds or Eastside. It's rare, but sometimes the smaller local shops don't always have what my little ears desire. Today I ventured in after 2 failed attempts searching for a specific CD. Yes, I might be the only person in the universe who still purchases actual CD's rather than Mp3's.. but I like to hold things. And to be held. I also like long walks down the boulevard and chocolate covered strawberries, but that is beside the point. \n\nZia is cool. They have good sales and I actually ended up scoring one today for $5 off one of the selections I chose. Cant beat that. The joint totally reminds me of Newbury Comics in good ol' Boston, not only do they have tons of tunes, but they have sweet schwag like corn dog flavored lip gloss, bacon band-aids, wack ass Asian toys, posters, key chains and clothing. The dudes at this specific location were cool. I didn't really need any assistance with anything, but they made sure I found what I was looking for.. \n\nIts certainly not my *favorite* record store in the valley, but its not so bad and they will probably have what you want.",2
"I've been to Soba Lounge before, three times before actually, and all three times I had a good meal, but my last visit was so unfortunately and unequivocally terrible that it felt necessary to share the details of our meal. \n\nFor appetizer, we had the kimchi pancakes, which were not fully cooked. They were doughy and sticky, and when we informed out waiter, he agreed with us that it was not fully cooked, but made no move to return the dish to the kitchen until we requested that it be at the very least warmed up to a degree in which it was actually edible. \n\nI had the sea bass, which was mediocre and somehow different from the other wonderful times I had ordered this delightful dish - it lacked the explosively delicious flavors. The curry that was ordered was the worst - completely and wholly NOT recommended. The rice was tough (probably not fully cooked once again), and the spices were arbitrary to the chicken itself, as though they were thrown in after the chicken was already cooked. \n\nGiven the price of Soba dishes, the bill certainly took a plunge into our wallets, but sadly with no degree of satisfaction for our taste buds or stomachs.",1
"Frankly I was just disappointed with Baton Rouge. \n\nIn sequence:\n- the Manhattan I ordered was watery and weak\n- the spinach dip was not cooked thoroughly and when it was taken back, they returned it after only reheating it in the microwave\n- the staff was cool but not overwhelming, especially with several occasions to provide good customer service\n- the filet was good, but not prime quality\n\nFor those south of the border, think Hillstone's/Houston's but with lower quality results.",1
"THEHotel used to be my favorite suite only hotel on the strip. Good service, great rooms, good layout of the hotel.\n\nAll of that is gone.\n\nNow as the Delano, they are in the process of redecorating everything. They took what used to be a nice, open, airy lobby and boxed it all in. I will give them the benefit of the doubt that it will look better once the construction is done,  but it is all too contemporary now for my taste.\n\nThe rooms are like being in an institution, almost florescent white everything with modern, uncomfortable furniture. I didn't have problems with my pillows, but some other people we were staying with did. I felt them for myself, they were hard as concrete. The closets? What were they thinking! The bar goes horizontal so you can't see what you have hung up. On one side, they put a safe on a shelf right below it, so you can't even hang anything up. Who designed this?\n\nThere are a FEW pluses that keep this from being one star. The bathroom. It hasn't changed except for the wall paper and the lighting and the brand of bath products. They have the most awesome, deep, bathtub with a waterfall spout. My favorite thing to do is to get some products from LUSH in the MB shops and soak in the bath while watching TV. They have also upgraded the TV to look more like what you would have at home, HD and a guide to look at instead of just channel numbers. Definitely an improvement there.\n\nThe cost of room service has tripled. We ordered dessert; a peach crumble a la mode and an ice cream. $37 WITHOUT tip! For the side of ice cream, they brought us up an entire pint. What a waste. Not to mention is took an hour and a half to get to us. Good thing we weren't waiting on dinner.\n\nThey also tried to charge me with 2 mini bar items that I never even touched. We didn't have housekeeping the entire 3 days we were there, so even if we DID partake in the overpriced items they stock in there, there was no way they could of known until after we checked out.\n\nI understand that the hotel is in transition phase. I hope that hotel management takes these concerns seriously and improves things before the hotel debuts in the fall. However, I imagine that this will no longer be my go-to Vegas hotel.",1
"This was the first spot is where our lunch crew was born. The burgers were good, but you can get better burgers for your buck in the valley. The stars are for their Tot Chos, which is nachos but with tots. Comes in oringinal tots, or sweet potato tots, with chili guac, sour cream... Both are worth it. If we go back, it'll be for tots.",2
"The service was terrible! When I asked for ranch dressing for my calzone as I waited for the calzone to arrive. The waitress grabbed the ranch from my coworkers appetizer and gave it to me.  I guess he didn't want it according to the waitress, cause he was not asked. Then my calzone that I ordered came and it was the wrong calzone. I didn't have time during my lunch break to wait while they cooked another.   When she picked up my other coworkers empty plate of buffalo wings she asked if I wanted the rest of his ranch dressing (streaks of buffalo sauce in it) .  Then at bill time I have her a $20 for a $13.21 lunch and waited for my change. She gave me back only $6- no change, so I included the missing change in the tip amount I left to make a %15 tip even though service was terrible. And got cursed at while leaving.  The food is good but they need to make a serious change in wait staff. If I remembered her name I would have added it to this review.",0
"I'm trying to figure out how such a great place like Mandalay Bay allows this lousy place to survive? This is not what I envision as part of my mLife experience! \n\nMost items were mediocre, tasteless, too dry, or just frozen food reheated. Desserts? Pitiful.\n\nI will credit a good waitstaff, but the kitchen staff looked bored. I would be too if I had to serve up this slop.\n\nMB management: how about it? Go sample the buffets at Bellagio, Wynn, and Wicked Spoon. Then shut this place and try again.",1
"Recently, I decided to make a roadtrip mini-adventure to Phoenix.  Wow, what a city.  It's beautiful and in the middle of HELL.  Paradise lost, one might say.\n\nI made my reservations to the Rodeway Inn Airport after consulting the internet for a place to stay.  I made a few considerations, such as brand name.  I've been a big fan of Clarion Brand hotels, since I've stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites in a variety of cities over the years.  I concluded my internet reservation the day before and decided this was in a great spot due to airport proximity and brand name.\n\nWhat...a...mistake...\n\nApparently, Phoenix is abnormal compared to many cities I've stayed in.  The airport is beautiful but the surrounding area is not.  The hotel chain has a great reputation, but this place was not beautiful. \n\nHere, let me explain!\n\nI arrived at 0500 (5am for y'all) in Phoenix.  My reservation was made, but apparently the Clarion website differs from their policy.  My room was given away since I hadn't checked in by 6am, even though the Clarion website has a Room Guarantee that says they'll hold the room until 7am the next day.  I had a bit of kick back from the onside employee that night.\n\nHotel is rather nasty. It's old.  It's dilapidated.  It was all locked up (more to follow on that).  It was grungy.  Not pleasant, nor reminiscent of the Clarion brand.\n\nRoom was freezing, and appeared sloppily put together.  Curtains were ill fitting, going over the window A/C Heater system and blowing.  Also, the heat didn't work too well, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nBelow the heater though, that's where the magic was found.  A used Trojan Magnum condom and wrapper.  Now THAT'S good times.\n\nApparently, this hotel, this area, this side of the airport is known to locals for the strip clubs, prostitution and drug dealers.  Yup.  It's all that.  \n\nNot gonna be staying here again.  Sorry Clarion.  You've lost me on this one.",1
"Disappointed. :( \n\nThis has been my favorite car wash. I've been going here for 7 years. No, they do not know me, but the service and quality have been good and consistent. I go out if my way to go here. About 15 miles out if my way, each way. \n\nThe problem? \nFirst... I always got the platinum car wash for $27 (it used to be $25). Today the same services cost me $31. \nSecond... They were severely understaffed. I was informed after going through the wash that they were running behind. It took 44 minutes in total for a services that usually takes about 25 minutes. \n\nIf you are that understaffed let people know before they pay for the service. When you increase your prices by 15% in my case, you are raising the bar. You missed it!!!\n\nSorry... I won't be back. There is a full-service car wash much closer to where I live. It's no longer worth it to go out if my way to use this facility.",1
"The Atrium is interesting as an event space, because if we really look at it, most people would call it like it is - a lobby.  That is good news, since it means you can get to it easily from a number of directions: The parking deck, the building, even the street give you easy access.\n\nUnfortunately, that means if there is a paid event in there, controlling that access can be a challenge for the organizers, and getting into the event may mean that you have to follow a maze - for instance, walking around from the back to the front just to go back through the appropriate entrance.  But it works.\n\nAs to an event space, it is nice, but it does not hold a ton of people.  Once you get beyond a certain size, it really needs to be a larger space.  For your mid-sized events, the space is excellent, but it can fill up quickly and that is when you can run into issues trying to navigate tables, mingle and also see what is going on at the event.",2
"I love magic shops. It reminds me of all the joy and wonder of my childhood. So, when I visited Vegas, I thought I'd bring a little of that home to my six year old. The magician at the counter assured me that my son could pull off the simple, yet impressive boxes of flowers in a bag trick. I was sold and they packaged up our sale. My son was so excited, until he opened the box. They gave us one that had been obviously used, and used a lot! The bag was already ripped in two places. The bottom of the boxes are all falling off, and the plastic is all dinged and scratched on the boxes. What a bummer. A twenty dollar bummer. Not cool. I really wanted to like these guys, but I feel like I got hustled. Had the product been new, I would have given them four stars, but since the whole core of our transaction was the product...1 star.",0
"Worst nail salon I've ever been to! Though clean, the service was horrible. The nail tech actually sprayed the cleaner while my feet were above it. She took two calls on her cell phone while working on me and both were not short convos. She was completely rude to me and my friend. Do not go here if you're expecting any quality or decent customer service",0
"On April 23, 2012 we decided to take my daughter here for her 12th birthday.. Big mistake!!!! I still can't stop thinking about how horrible it was. We got there about 6:30 pm... Getting in was ok but if you have more then two people they put you aside and take care of smaller groups first.. The wait was ok but I heard other parties complaining that night about being set aside.. I do have to say our server was awesome .. Thanks RYAN .. However!!!! , the food was HoRRIBLE.. gross, Yuck .. There was no fish.. Except crawfish which you could tell nobody was touching..  Most of it was cold or like the turkey was dry .. I'm so disappointed.. I usually don't write reviews but I thought what a waist of money on food that was so awful. Won't be back here again!!!",0
"We frequent this place about 3-4 times a year.  I usually get either the cheese steak with peppers and mushrooms or one of the hoagies.  Had the cheese steak yesterday and it was pretty decent...could have used a bit more cheese though.  Lots of meat and veggies.  The roll was really good.  Overall, not in the same league as the cheese steaks at Jersey Mike's though.",2
I was excited to see that they were opening a burger place thats less then a 5 minute walk. The first burger I tried here was very disappointing. The burger was way too small for the price. The meat was grey and didnt look like beef at all. I would definitely stick with johnny frescos and the grill as those burgers actually fill you up and give you really good beef.,1
"2's little harsh, it's more like 2.5.\n\nI smelled bleach as soon as I sat down at a booth near restroom. But that was only a warning sign.\nWhile my friends seemed to enjoy their omelet and benedict for brunch, my so-called Belgian Waffle suffered from a serious identity crisis. I want to know what was Belgian Waffle about it. \n\nWhat I got was a pale colored, flavorless slab with out-of can syrup/juice immersed soggy mess. Wow, really. How could you do that to a plate of waffle?\n\nThe service was ok. Pleasant, but without a charm.\nThe place gets busier with after-church crowd on Sunday. So timing is a key.",1
"Pink Spot is a pretty cool lil place. I was told that it was out in the Vegas area, just off the strip. Making the trek out here was something else!! I didn't think that it would have been such a mission to get here. My GPS signal was lost. That's how far out there it was. Luckily for us, I had mapped it out earlier and had really looked into the detailed directions. This shop, in my opinion, was good and bad. The good thing was that it was nicely decorated and clean. Their signage was easy to read and their various promo info was posted clearly in several places. The flavors here are pretty cool. They are not super cheap juices like at some other places. They have a good variety of flavors. However, and this is one of the thing that bothers me the absolute most, they do not have many of their flavors available for sample. You have to just take their word for it that it's good or bad or that you would or would not like it. I didn't like that part. I thought that they would have a better stash of sample juices for customers who were first time pink spot juice buyers. I also didn't like the girl that was helping us. She was full of attitude and talked to us like we weren't human. WTF!! I know that I had some questions about different products that they had in their cases but she didn't need to give me that look like I was an idiot. And of course, the tone in her voice couldn't been a bit more welcoming. She almost looked annoyed that she had to help us. Too bad she was the one behind the counter that day. I don't like the whole roll your eyes and smack your gum thing at me. I think the other thing that really made me upset was that lots of regulars walked in and were helped before us although we had been waiting a lot longer. Not to mention, once you've \""ordered\"" your juices, you are stuck waiting for them. There are a bunch of ppl in the back room working like oompa loompas. I think that they are dispensing your juices into your bottles and things. Anyway, it takes 'em a while to do that and so, rather than have them readily available, you have to wait for your bottles of juice to be filled. Man that took too long. In the mean time, too, there isn't anything to do. It was fun to visit just to see where this place was but there is NO way that I'd really want to come back. I can just as easily order my juices on line. BOO!!",1
"You must have at least 4 people in your group to have a table to yourself!  I used to have a lot of business meetings with clients at this place (at least twice a week) as it was right down the street from my office.  The food is not great and the service is unusually horrible but they have a big selection for my business clients to choose from as most have different tastes and it is more of a relaxing environment in which most like. One Sunday, 2 friends and I were having lunch at a table for four people.  They sat a stranger with us to have lunch....very awkward, but was okay as we were all drinking beers.  About two weeks later (on a Friday), I was entertaining potential clients discussing our company and answering other questions.  There were three of us sitting at a table for four people.  They had the \""balls\"" to sit another guy at our table as they say they were now sitting groups together to fill all spots.  I told the manager that we were discussing business as he seemed to not care and still sit the guy with us.  Needless to say, I have never returned to a zipps and never will.",0
"It was good.  but.  was it the best pizza ever?  no.  Do I have anything bad to say?  Nope.  I probably would if I had had to wait for a table.  Luckily, three seats opened up at the bar right when we got there.  Honestly - I have no complaints.  It was truly A-OK.",2
"I went in for a polish change.  They were busy and the shift manager was stressed out.  She decided to do the polish change herself.  She rushed through it and did a terrible job.  I've never complained and spoken up when I haven't loved my polish but this was bad.  So with my heart racing I got the nerve up to say something.  She decided to argue about it and defend the polish change.  I told her to never mind but then she insisted on doing it again.  I was embarrassed beyond belief.  Apparently she didn't care that she was arguing with a customer.  \n\nSo here is the redeeming part of my review.  A few minutes after the manager lady left another employee, who apparently saw what happened, came and touch up the polish and was so sweet to me.  She put my sandals on me and walked me up and wrote the ticket and had me pay.  She was ultra kind.  This kind lady is the reason for the three stars.  The manager lady is the reason for the lacking two stars.  \n\nIt's kind of sad because I've been there several times in the past and been satisfied.\n\nBEWARE...don't get just a polish change.  They won't like you.",2
"We really gave this place a chance but it just failed in so many ways. \n\nFirst off, I don't know if the guy in charge of house sound is deaf or what but the music was so loud that we were straining our voices trying to talk (yell) to each other. Then the Canadiens game began and it was even louder. For a place trying to serve fancy looking food, the ambiance just sucked because of the noise. It was not a busy night, so I'm not sure why they thought they had to deafen their patrons.\n\nThe menu was simple enough but unfortunately so was the waitress. This waitress was just not all there.  She was pleasant, easy on the eyes but that's about it. She took our drink orders, upsold us to the larger portion of salmon tartar and forgot to take our dinner order.\n \nWhen she came back with the drinks 10 minutes later, she spun on her heels to go do something else and we had to almost grab her to get her to take our orders. We ordered the flank (bavette) steak and she seemed to forget to ask how we would like it cooked. My dinner companion took matters into his own hands and actually chased the waitress down across the restaurant to make SURE she knew to put the order in for medium rare. 20 minutes passed, 30 minutes passed. No tartar, no flank steaks.\n\nThen out came the tartar appetizer at the same time as the steaks... The tartar wasn't particularly inspired, little flavour and served with 6 french fries. We dug into the steaks and, wouldn't you know it, they were well done to the point of being the tenderness of shoe leather and as dry as tree bark. 1-2 bites in we cut the middle of the steaks to see if there was any hopeful hint of pink, but no dice. The waitress didn't ask the basic  question of \""is everything ok?\"" as we began our meal so we tried to flag down the guy in the dress shirt who seemed to be a manager. He didn't see us (or anyone else for that matter) as he just sat down on the bar and fiddled with his iPhone. \n\nWe finally managed to get a manager and by that time it was too much for us. It was a very unfortunate experience but at least the manager was kind enough to delete the shoe steaks from the bill. As we headed for the door I doubt our waitress had any idea what had transpired. She was cheerful and looked as if she was pleased to see satisfied customers leaving. Alas, that was clearly not not the case -  Factory was a total failure right from front of house to back.\n\nWe left hungry and disappointed, so we went up the street to La Belle Provence to get hot dogs and poutine instead. At least there, they knew what they're doing.",0
"My wife and I were invited to the pre-grand opening thing here last night.  It was pretty much like I expected; free food, pretty busy, etc., etc.\n\nThe actual location is very nice, very new and very clean so no complaints there.  Their entire staff from the people running the event to the managers to the cashier were all very fast, friendly and helpful.\n\nI didn't really know what to make of this place.  Is it fast food?  Is it a nice, sit-down type of place?  I think it is a small, more \""upscale\"", \""boutiquey\"" Fudruckers.  I'm not saying that is a bad thing.  Just saying that is what I thought of the place.  \n\nAnyway, about the food:\n\n* Smashwedge Salad - my wife and I shared this and it was very good.  Very odd though (in a good way) for a fast food place.\n\n* Classic Smashburger - Excellent.  Perfectly juicy and tasty.  Definitely one of the best fast food burgers I've tasted.  You can see and taste that the ingredients were very fresh.\n\n* Smashfries and Sweet Potato Smashfries = No bueno!!!  I was really looking forward to eating these, but I didn't think they were very good at all.  I just do not enjoy rosemary on my fries.  French fries shouldn't taste like soap or something.  I don't know - maybe I'm just not fancy enough to like random herbs on my fries.  At the very least they could have went farther down fancy lane and provided some aioli which would have been nice.  Next time I'm going to hold the flowers and order regular fries for sure.\n\nI know I wasn't paying but I feel this place is overpriced.  An average of $6-$7 for a burger or chicken sandwich seems a bit high.  By the time you add fries and a drink you are over $10 which is way high for a fast food place.\n\nI really wanted to try the veggie frites but they were out so maybe next time I'll give them a whirl.  I may give the fried pickles a shot as well because I am very curious as I had never tried one before.\n\nAnyway, my first Smashburger experience was a pleasant one and I would like to return to get another burger, try their regular fries, get some veggie frites and maybe a fried pickle.",2
"Hoping for an indigenous Mexican food experience ( having read so on Yelp) I trundled to this place (which is next to iMart, A thai restaurant and a newly opened \""Deshi snack food store\"".\n\nService: Good and very friendly. I got the salsa/chips and the verde /roja spicy sauce for my taco served t me. I also got the medium Jamaica (even though I paid for the small). I also helped myself to their pickled Carrot and Serrano peppers (mmmm Spicy.. though I prefer the grilled peppers from Senor taco) \n\nFood: I chose to order the more adventurous Tripe, head and Shrimp tacos. \nTripe: Rather gamey and had a smell like the cow was having a bad day when it got chosen to be eaten\nHead: Interesting taste and smell (tasted a lot like a slightly off Carne asada). I was expecting portions of brain as well (but maybe after Bovine Spongi..what not,  its probably safer that I didn't)\nShrimp: Bit overdone (hence rubbery) but with a good griil aroma and flavor.\n\nAuthenticity: Definitely \n\nNet Impression: Will go here again and order the more traditional fare. I'm leaning towards the mole to make my final decision. As always Mom and Pop authentic stores always has a soft corner for me.",2
"I'm thinking more of a 3.5 for this place. Let's start with a negative, the parking is usually a nightmare. The narrow strip of parking spots doesn't accommodate everybody when it's a Friday night. I actually tried eating here this past Friday but we couldn't find a parking spot anywhere, so we left.\n\nLuckily for them I've eaten here many times so I will return! The food is good, and all at a very reasonable cost. Queso dip is always a great way to start, along with the margaritas. Both always tasty and delightful! Strawberry frozen is my recommendation :) The food has usually been good for me and the waitstaff is always pretty quick with service. I usually get chicken quesadilla with queso cheese, yum! When I order take out, they always pack plenty of rice. If you're craving Mexican, this is a great place to go.",2
"Tasted great -- felt like I have been in some Washington forest gnawing on pine cones, trying to survive... that's exactly what their Suit-and-tie IPA tasted like: sappy, thick, piney... I can still taste the needles on my tongue. The Weisse beer was sour. I am not quite sure where they went wrong there, or if their red sour keg had an illicit relationship with weisse, but the two tasted exactly the same: nose-wrinkling tooth-hurting sour. We had four people in the group, and I am the only person who likes sour, so I was a trooper and drank everyone's Weisse as well as my Red Sour. The Stout was, well, a Stout, albeit weak. The IPA was pine-needly as well. If you don't mind scraping sap off your gums, picking needles out of your teeth, and drinking squirrel vomit, you will LOVE it!! Honestly the only reason we went there was because the brewery was lauded as the best brewery in the U.S.!! I say, the worst!! Unless you are a squirrel -- then you will love it!! :-)  One star for beer, and two for atmosphere - atmosphere was great, and if the brews were phenomenal, they would get 5 stars from me. Have not tried their food, so that was not included in my review.",2
"Been going here for sometime. My friends have as well. Food is good; atmosphere is fun; wait staff is good. However, each time we get the bill its wrong by over charging. Once in a blue moon is acceptable but each time....something is fishy. \nWanted to update review. Chicken wings are very good. And yes they will bake the wings after they have been cooked despite a disagreement with female blonde bartender. She must have had a bad day.",2
"for everyone who says this place is amazing, they must be blind to true culinary technique.  ok so first thing I noticed was the drab wait staff.  very boring and didn't even sound excited to be at work.  on another note, the menu is written well but the food did not deliver.  i wanted to try the fried deviled eggs, and they were clearly warmed up in the microwave and dry. the homemade spicy aioli, was nothing more than sriracha and mayo.  i understand what aioli, but is wasn't mixed well or something. then, i noticed how sloppy everything was plated. no attention to detail!  the knife cuts were terrible and sloppy.  definitely can tell there is not a true chef in the kitchen, rather some cooks.\n\nthe shepherds pie was a farce, (don't expect to get full)  lets not get ahead of our self, it was beef stew with a stack of mashed potatoes on top.  also, the shrimp and sausage and grits, again, was tomatoes and shrimp with a side ot butter and heavy cream added to grits.  \n\nthe bacon smore dessert was plated terribly, looked messy, and unappetizing... keep in mind, it sounded delicious... but at the end of the day, the food was either cold and reheated, burnt from being reheated, or taken out of the freezer and sloppily plated. you can tell nothing is truly made to order.\n\ndo not take a date her to impress them.  that is all\n\nps. im getting some rather insulting comments, let's keep it professional, this is my opinion. nothing else.",1
"So so disappointed in this place. Please be wary of the integrity of the employees and the owner. Here's the story... I've been to this place a few times before and the food has always been very good. I placed a takeout order a few weeks back and requested no Serrano peppers on BBQ wrap. When I got home we discovered finely chopped serranos in the wrap which resulted in my wife being unable to eat the wrap due to the heat of the peppers. I called and let the restaurant know of the mess up. The employee was very nice and apologized and assured me she would write my name down for a free wrap to make up for the mistake. I went in today to take advantage of my free wrap. I ordered, told the employee that I had a free wrap, she smiled said ok and took my order. As I'm waiting the owner comes and introduces himself. I'm thinking he's come to find out what happened and I'm thinking to myself this is good customer service! Come to find out he lets me known whoever I spoke with didn't write my name down in \""the book\"" and unless I can show some proof of who I spoke with he would not honor my free wrap. He then proceeded to question my motivation and ask if I had some proof of my visit three weeks ago... Without proof no free sand.... Point of this whole story is this is a horrible way to treat a customer much less a customer whose order you screwed up on.. Not only do you screw up but then you accuse me of lying about it... And this is coming from the owner of the establishment! I hope it was worth it you've lost a customer for life and I will make sure my office NEVER orders lunch from your establishment ! Everyone else reading this should boycott a place that no respect for the customers that make their business.",0
"I recently went for a sold-out concert and my chief complaint seems to be the same as everyone else's - not nearly, no how, no way on this earth, are there enough restrooms here. I missed several songs because I went during intermission between two bands and there still wasn't enough time to get in & out of the restroom. The lines were ridiculous. They're also far away from the concert itself. My suggestion would be to stack port-a-johns up at the back of the grassy area. They make a lot of money off of selling alcoholic beverages and one well-known side effect is the classic \""breaking of the seal\"". Unless you want people to stop drinking and stop spending their money - get more bathrooms!! \n\nThey don't charge for parking which is great. Cell phone service doesn't exist once the shows have started. If you're attempting to call or text to meet up with friends - it's not happening. Make your plans and designate a rendezvouz location prior to the show starting. Get there early or you'll have to park far away & traffic will take forever to get you in.",2
"There really isn't the need to go to a pretentious and rather obnoxious restaurant to get such a small amount of so-so food for a disproportional amount of money with inconsiderate service to boot.  \n\nFurthermore, serving potatoes and white bread, it is clear that this restaurant has no knowledge of what constitutes a healthy meal.  (If you don't either then you might consult the book, \""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School guide to healthy eating.\"")\n\nThe service started out bad and got worse.  When we arrived only 1 of the 8 or so tables for two was occupied, and the attempted to seat us right next to the other occupied table so that we'd have to listen to the other couple and vice-versa.  We refused that table and opted for one a few yards away, only to find that the person seated in the aisle-most seat constantly gets bumped by waiters coming back and forth to the tables in the front section.  The server could have warned us about this and seated us at another of the many empty tables for two, but she failed to do so.   When we left there was still only one other couple in the two-seater section, there really was no excuse for being placed at a table where you get repeatedly jossled by cross-traffic, nor was there any excuse for having the aisle so narrow near a table.\n\nI became truly angry at this restaurant when the food arrived.  I got the Salmon, and there WASN'T MUCH OF IT THERE.  The waiter arrived to ask how the first few bites were, and I almost told him that actually there were only three bites there.  It was supposed to come with some other vegetable-type stuff, and there was also very little of that.  The salmon wasn't cooked that well, certainly the stuff I make at home is better.  \n\nThe infuriating service will spoil the mood, this is not the place for any sort of social occasion.",0
"We had heard that after the change of ownership that this improved greatly. We never tried it before, but thought we would give it a shot. We tried the continental breakfast and the mushroom spinach quiche. We were disappointed in both. The continental breakfast comes with a croissant that was too doughy and the crepe omelet was mediocre.  The quiche had good flavor, but was the dough was still raw which spoiled the taste. Hopefully, they get their act together over time because it is a very cute place with a lot of potential.",1
Found this place on packer-bars.com. Tara-bull!  Some what rude service. If I ever go back it will be because I'm feeling antisocial and want to be left alone. Perhaps I wasn't welcome or some one was having a bad day but this post did get a rather nasty reply accusing me of lying. The place was dead for an un-televised game and I can totally understand why. Although it could be the lady who has a very high pitched scream when there is a good play or even extra point. ;),0
"I like how its cheap, but does it really need to look cheap? It's as though they decided oh let's take over San Remo and add some cheap things to make it appear as if they are staying at a beach house in Vegas. They glued some wood to the wall for the headboard and cut(not a clean cut either) an uneven rectangle for the outlet. The signs that most hotels use to advertise conserving water has a nice approach but this sign says \""Do you really need clean sheets/towels?\"" whoa...of course I do. Are you telling me that if that previous customer didn't touch that towel and left it folded, that you will leave that in there? Scary thought. Clean sheets is a must! Doesn't help that they had a burned cigarette hole in the comforter in a non-smoking room. But of course what do you expect from a room that was about $75 on a Saturday night during Halloween. Glad I only stayed there for one night",0
"YELP REVIEW UPDATE\n\nI AM UBER BUMMED, but my review below was for the CHEYENNE location, not this Rainbow location. Apparently the CHEYENNE location went out of business. The last time I was there, the managers told me they were opening a second location (Rainbow).\n\nIt's all good though, because you can get the original Bobbie from Capriottis just down the street on Cheyenne and Buffalo. It's no knockoff like the Robert.\n\nAlso, beware of false advertising. These guys claim LV Weekly gave them the award for \""Best Sandwich in Las Vegas\"" in 2010 and 2011. Not entirely true. In 2010, they were tied with Capriotti's. And in 2011, the best sandwich went to The Johnny at Johnny McGuire's. Google it for yourself. \n\nDon't buy into false advertising. This place off Cheyenne was damn good. But don't let lies deceive you.\n\nIn any case, any Yelp reviews you see, might be from the old location at Cheyenne. Not a knock on Eddie D's because I used to love this place. I just don't want my review of the Cheyenne location to transfer over to the Rainbow location. It's not fair.",0
"For a restaurant that does not serve extras with their burger, that is to say that fries do not come with your burger, you would think that they would make it up in service and presentation, but no they don't. The service is marginal. They have young, inexperienced waiters and waitresses who do not know the menu and are unable to make recommendations. Their presentation is weak. I've been there twice - once for a burger the other for a salad. The burger was nothing special and the chopped ahi, avocado, and cashew salad was oily, had 1 slice of avocado, and literally 3 cashews hidden in the salad. They are only receiving 1 star because the beer was very cold and well poured. \n\nIf you want a burger which should ALWAYS include fries, go somewhere else. Fries are extra and they try to make them special but without success. If you want a cold beer while your significant other is shopping at the Biltmore, stop in and take a load off. If you want a meal, go somewhere else.",0
"I wanted Cork to be amazing but it was just alright.\n\nThere used to be a restaurant my wife and I would go to in Las Vegas that was our favorite restaurant in the world.  It was far off The Strip in a little strip mall, they served great food, and had perfect service.  Cork's menu and photos were as close as I have found to that restaurant in Vegas.\n\nI don't have any real complaints about Cork, the food was good and the service was good, it just didn't blow me away like I had hoped it would - which is strange to me because I had Gazelle for dinner that night and I love restaurants that have interesting ingredients on the menu!  Maybe I'm being too hard on Cork - maybe it wasn't my restaurant from Las Vegas like I had hoped and I had unrealistic expectations.\n\nSo, keeping the first part in mind, let's start over.\n\nMy wife and I had been excited to visit Cork ever since we moved back to Arizona in 2012.  The menu looked amazing and (unfortunately for me) there was a menu item on the previous seasons menu that was Elk Strip Loin cooked in Duck Fat.  Those are two of my favorite things brought together in what sounds like one incredible dish.  I wish I had had the chance to try it, but it was off the menu by the time we visited.\n\nWhen I called ahead to let the restaurant know that we were running a few minutes late they said it would not be an issue and were very accommodating.  When we arrived, we were taken to our table right away.\n\nAs I mentioned already, I had gazelle for my entr\u00e9e but it was a tossup between that or the Wild Boar Stew.  I ended up choosing the gazelle in the end mostly because the boar was a stew and I wanted something more substantial than that.  My wife had a steak and she was a little disappointed in it; she said it was just a steak and not very special.\n\nAs I was browsing Cork's menu while writing this review (a few months after having visited), I can definitely see what I would order if I were sitting in their dining room right now.  They have a rabbit risotto for appetizer and a mustard crusted wild boar entr\u00e9e.  This time, I wouldn't consider anything but the boar!\n\nI'm still not certain what it is that makes me so hesitant to return to Cork.  Perhaps it's the price?  Cork is not an inexpensive restaurant and, for the cost, maybe I'm leery of going back.  I would go back - Cork is definitely not a restaurant I would avoid, but I guess I'm not anxious to go back... but looking at their menu does make me want to go back.  I'm conflicted about Cork.",2
"So I decided to try Tea Station today since I was at Cafe Noodle to get some take out.  I had read some of the reviews here at yelp and figured it should to pretty good.  I was disappointed with the place.  First thing was that they don't use fresh fruit in their drinks.  I ordered a honeydew melon snow ice with boba for my hubby and a rose milk tea with boba for me.  Both were mediums.  The boba were good, but I felt for almost 5 dollars for a medium they could use real fruit instead of powder.  Second the service was not very good.  Well, actually the service was good for me but I think not that good for a couple of Caucasian ladies that walked in after me.  The waitress got very impatient with them because they wanted to know if they used real fruit or not and so just kept talking about how annoying they were in Chinese.  I felt that their question was a legitimate question and she should not have started talking about them even if they didn't understand.  \nI will definitely be sticking to Ay Chung or the place in the China Town mall because they both use real fruit for their drinks.",1
"My gf liked the job they did BUT.........\n\nI called at 10:41pm and they said they were open.  Yes. I asked the cost of manicure & pedicure.  $35 & $25, respectively. \n\nSo we went there and While I'm waiting I started reading the yelp reviews. Uh oh!!  That's when I read all the reviews about the \""bait & switch\"" tactics they use there.  \n\nTo make a long story short.  When I asked for a total it was $120!!!!  Plus tip????  It went from $60 to $120. \n\nCan you do zero stars??\n\nI'd stay away if I was you.",0
"I have wanted to go here for brunch for a long time.  Finally made it there this past weekend.  Great setting -- so pretty and unique and reminds that Phoenix can be awesome.\n\nI arrived at 11:30 and had a 20 minute wait. No big as it gave me time to walk the grounds.  Was seated, odered the ham & cheese omelletee with home fries.  Food took about 30 minutes, again no biggie but something to be aware of if you are hungry and/or with children.\n\nFood was dropped off with not much fan fare.  Immedietly I saw a black hair sticking out of the fries.  Eww and Hello!  Did no one see this?  Ate the omelette, was very good but found two more very long black hairs intertwined in the fries.  It was gross.  One hair falls out --ok its unfortunate, but this...was like someone had pulled these long hairs out in wrapped them up in the fries.\n\nNo thanks.",1
Been here at least a dozen times and let me say the food ( depending on the cooks on duty ) is awesome! But the service will leave such a bad taste in your mouth that you'll probably not come back more then once. As for myself I'm probably not going back for awhile in hopes that management gets it together. Till then I'd suggest Honey Salt instead. Food is just as good if not better and the service is great.,1
"Maybe it's what I ordered but i wasn't impressed with this place at all.  Their decor was really nice especially with their chocolate fountain.  \n\nWe ordered the crepe with the exotic fruits on it. All it had was the crepe, the fruits were I guess all pureed together and bit of mango.  Since all the fruits were pureed, to me it tasted and had the texture of baby food! It was too weird and not so good. The ice cream that it came with was pretty good though.  It was coconut and it had real coconut shavings in it.\n\nOverall, the place is cute, but everything is really overpriced.  Our crepe was $10 and looking at everything else, it's pretty overpriced. But then again, what do you expect?  it's vegas!",1
"Awful awful awful service. These girls were SO unfriendly and completely wasted mine and my friend's time. They kept making us repeat ourselves and when they didn't have ANY of the things we wanted, they tried to sell us different versions. Like a different shade of concealer. Um, NO THANKS. When ONE OF the registers ran out of paper, the girl made us wait even though there was a fully functional register right next to it. She also took so long to refill it.. like on purpose, so slow. It was really really disrespectful. She also gave my friend the wrong products. It was a truly terrible experience.",0
Good local spot. Margaritas are too sweet. Poor waitress had the whole floor all to herself. I witnessed some people waiting behind me that left cause they were waiting so long for someone to take their order. They have a salsa bar in the back with some descent salsa. In would def come back for the tortilla soup. We ordered enchiladas. The chicken was tasty. Decor is cute with overhead hanging lights. This is not a crazy party spot or anything. Prob wouldn't come with a group cause of slow service.,2
"Listen, the place is kitschy, silly and if you are into seriously tacky Mexican reproduced goods this is your mecca. Unfortunately for the owners,I will not support bad customer service. Bitter, bitter, very unattractive couple works the register.I will not go back. I say, check out Buffalo Bills just down the road!",0
"They sell the Big Flats brand beer for only $3.33/6 pk.  And they are close.  That's about all I need to know.   I just moved here part time and will probably stop by once or twice a month.  Beyond that they have most of the other common drugstore products.  You have to sign up for their rewards card if you want to get the sale prices, tho.",2
"We got there around noon on a Tuesday.  It was dead, only 1 guy at the bar.  We waited for about 3 mins before someone noticed we were waiting for a table.  I should have known better to dine without checking Yelp first.  \n\nWe got seated and the hostess notified us that she is also our server.  She took our drink orders.  And she was back right away with our drinks.  She took our food order.  We both ordered a soup and an appetizer for lunch.  We waited 15 mins and our soups came out  within 5 mins our food came out too.\n\nIRISH POTATO SOUP - it came out warm, there was only a few chunks of potatoes, and tasted ok.\n\nCHICKEN FINGERS - the chicken was not crispy but hard.  The fries were  good!\n\nService was actually good.  The food is not so good.",1
"We went to see Maleficent this past weekend and although the movie was good I am not so sure $25 per ticket was worth it. The seats were full off stains, the blankets smelled as if they hadn't been washed in weeks, and the tables do not come out far enough so that you aren't covered in food and crumbs... not sexy for a date night. I was fortunate enough to have enough crumbs down my shirt for a snack later.... um, kinda gross. I must say I was a little worried that I couldn't see my food at all so I was a little freaked that I didn't know if there was a hair in it or not but overall the food tasted good. \n\nI feel there should be a call button so that you can summon the waitress. My burgers were to come with a thousand island sauce however I asked that it be replaced with ketchup. That didn't happen which meant I had a dry hamburger and no way to call her to fix it. By the time someone came to ask if we needed anything else, the food was already cold. \n\nThe apple martini was tasty and the wine bar in the lobby was cool. \n\nTotal cost for the night: \n\n$50 on tix\n$80 on food\n\nPretty pricey for dirty seats. \n\nI don't think I'll be rushing back. I'm going to try out the rest of the fancy movie theaters before I say I'll never be back but trust I won't be back anytime soon.",2
"this 99 ranch is so tiny, dirty and stinky. there were boxes around the aisles, which made it hard to walk around. i could careless about the customer service, since that in asian stores pretty much doesn't exist. however, i need to have one or the other. you either offer great selections and great shopping environment, or offer great customer service. this place failed at both.",0
Love the musical/art inspired names but was not impressed with the oh so chewy roast beef in my sandwich. I ordered the Overture which was a horseradish + roast beef sandwich served on a baguette. \n \n - Horseradish had good kick \n - Baguette more like a soft french roll\n - Sandwich suffered a bit from having everything on one side of the sandwich leaving me      with bites of just beef/horsey sauce\n\nProximity to ASU is a bonus though and they have free parking in front.\n\nA solid option for students looking for a bite but not really a destination in itself\n\n*Appreciate the cookie though,2
"I feel like SnowFlake Shavery is over hyped. The texture is just the same as other shaved snow places, maybe a little softer, but definitely not as creamy as I would like. Their menu is limited to 9 flavors and typical toppings. Besides that, the workers are super friendly and fast. I got my order before I finished paying!",2
"After reading the numerous positive reviews and being a short walk from the hotel I canceled a reservation at another restaurant and the family headed on over. The clientele  was a bit eclectic...mostly older establishment types, but intermixed with everything from young bachelorette party-goers to aging Saturday Night Fever aficionados. The mixed clientele was a harbinger of the meals to come with  tantalizing appetizers and desserts, but major disappointments with the main courses.\n\nWhen the appetizers arrived, we knew we made the right call. The briny muscles with loads of garlic, tomatoes, capers, olives in a savory wine sauce were divine. The lobster gnocchi was loaded with crab and lobster...very rich and satisfying. The Caprese salad was made with the freshest tomatoes and mozzarella...all top shelf.  \n\nThen the dinners arrived...a Mahi-Mahi filet served over Spanish rice look disheveled on the plate. The mahi-mahi was grilled adequately, but the Spanish rice tasted like something my mother made from a box. Overly spicy and completely obliterating the fish. Next were the recommended scallops. They looked like they had been sitting under the lights for hours. They appeared pallid on the plate...just sitting their lifeless surrounding a pile of wilting greens. Finally the chicken dish was simply bland...inadequately seasoned and completely forgettable. \n\nWe needed something to cleanse our palates from the dinner, so took a chance on dessert and were pleasantly surprised. The rich and hot chocolate chip cookie covered with creamy vanilla ice cream were a hit. \n\nIt's hard to figure how a place that does appetizers so well could completely miss on its main courses...not one, but all of them. Maybe the kitchen just had an off night, but for a restaurant in this price range the batting average needs to be a lot higher. My recommendation is to stick to the appetizers and a nice glass of wine.",1
"After picking up my friend @ the apo., I suggested this place. She is a popular Yelper in Northern California. \n\nWhen I lived in Peoria, we ate here about once a month. One of us has changed, because I didn't like it as much as I use to. \n\nFirst, we were the only table in the place, never a good sign. \n\nThe waitress brings menus, I tell her right away that we want the hummus. I like their hummus. My friends asks if some of the menu items can be made into a wrap? The waitress replies, \""Yes, that is on our lunch menu.\"" So, it is 1:00, why didn't she bring us lunch menus? \nSo we order. Gyros are excellant. Great flavor. My friend had the falaffel wrap. Way to much cumin. That is all you could taste.",2
"El Pollo Supremo is a pint-sized version of \""El Pollo Loco\"" with fewer food choices and the inability to accept credit/debit cards. Ultimately, whether you choose the corporate fast food giant or this little hole-in-the-wall, the food, the taste and the price are all about the same.\n\nAll in all, the food here is just \""ok\"".  In Southern California, I grew up eating this style of food regularly and El Pollo Supremo, while offering a familiarity I appreciate with its simple beans-meat-tortilla approach, is absolutely nothing special.  \n\nI've had both the Chicken (pollo asado) and Beef (carne asada) dishes here.  Occasionally, the chicken arrives overcooked and dry.  The steak has been consistently pleasant and is quite tasty, moreso on its own than when mixed with the other ingredients.  The beans are always plain and the watery salsa certainly isn't anything to write home about, but it all works in that way that simple, decent \""comfort\"" food should.  \n\nAs for price, it's certainly not as \""cheap\"" as some make it seem, but it won't break the bank, either.  Figure $10-$12 per person and everyone's belly will leave happy.  The best value is to grab a few friends and split a couple items.  If you've got a picky date, this is the perfect place to take them, because they'll only have to make one decision...chicken or beef!\n\nPlease note that there is really nothing \""wrong\"" with El Pollo Supremo.  However, there is nothing particularly outstanding about it, either.  \n\nThe 5-star and \""100%\"" ratings across the internet review boards are certainly more than it deserves.  People in Phoenix seem to have a skewed idea of what \""good\"" Mexican food is and have a habit of glorifying mediocrity whenever possible.  This place received a \""Best of Phoenix\"" award for 2011...that just proves my point!  Since we're just tossing acclamations out there, I'll give El Pollo Supremo the \""Best of Mediocre\"" for 2012.  Now on to the next joint...",1
"Wow, what a horrible restaurant, why does everyone think they can cook?  Ok lets start from the top, the hostess seemed really put off that we wanted dinner.  With a huff she sat us down.  The food?  Oh my, it's been a while since I've such slop.  The calimari was not edible, over cooked, tasteless.  Oh and what's that dip?  Mayonaise, from a jar.  Seriously the food tasted like they went to the market, and not the upscale one, bought some food, unpackaged it, marked up the cost 1000% and called it Italian.  Don't bother.  I actually left 95% of the food on the plate, paid and left.  oh well",0
"These cupcakes were ok, but they taste just like they are from the grocery store. I dont know what's up with the frosting, it just has a strange taste. When I got there, there were hardly any cupcakes left, so my selection was limited, if they wouldn't have been buy one get one free, I would have never paid the prices they want for those cupcakes. It's ok, i would eat them again, but I don't think I will ever be going back. Sprinkles wins, hands down, anyone who says otherwise is nuts!",1
"Where to start? My husband LOVED the gin & tonic's here, but not because of what you would think. The circle ice cubes won his heart. He in fact loves them so much we now have molds to make circle ice cubes at home. Only they are not crystal clear like Jaleo's are, so we fail.\n\nI did enjoy this restaurant. It was fun, unique, and the food was great. The only issue I have is that we spent about $150 (did include alcohol), and we were not full when we left. I'm a big eater, and tapas apparently are just not my thing. Unless of course it includes an entr\u00e9e afterwards.\n\nThe food was very good though. Every dish (with the exception of one), was amazing. The fried bacon-wrapped dates were amazing, and the paella that we ordered was fabulous. The one thing that fell short for us was something our server suggested, that ended up being a bag of chips (seriously - and a fun-size bag of chips at that), with a ketchup-y sauce drizzled over the chips. \n\nI did like the presentation of most of the tapas, one even came in a shoe! The atmosphere is very fun and unique, I also love that you can see the food being cooked. We ordered a porrone of spiked cider, and that was fabulous! \n\nOverall, the price is what got me. For Vegas, it's actually not that bad. But for me, if I spend that much money, I want to leave full.",2
"If you had asked me a month ago, I would have given this place 5 stars.  Sadly, after my second visit, I feel the need to write this review.\n\nThe food and beer selection at O.H.S.O. is pretty great, which is why I didn't give them 1 star.  In fact, my first time here was pretty good.  I thought this would be a go-to when I come to town, but then I had dinner there this past week, and well, I'm never going back.\n\nNow, I admit, I'm a picky eater and I like to modify my dinner.  I live in LA, where almost every single person I know modifies in some form or fashion, and it's rare for that to be an issue.  You would think a restaurant in a city as big as Phoenix would see a lot of that, too.  However...\n\nWhen it came time for me to order my meal, I started to explain that I would prefer my pizza with no cheese, and a few other items off of it.  The last time I had been there, this was not a problem at all, and that server was happy to help me.  THIS time, I unfortunately was served by Brooke, who not only didn't help me, but she served up a healthy portion of her less-than-helpful attitude.  Upon ordering, she told me \""You could do that - but it's not gonna taste very good\"" (in a pretty b****-y tone, mind you).  That's funny - I don't remember asking her opinion of what I wanted to eat!  I've actually worked in the service industry before, and there is a way to let a customer know that a certain dish might not be as palatable that doesn't include a rude and condescending tone.  Little did she know that I had eaten the same exact dish a month prior and enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nIn a town that has a lot of restaurants, I hope this is a lesson to treat customers like you prefer they come back again, and appreciate their business while they are there.",1
"We lost a legend of deli's and it is replaced with a somewhat chain restaurant called So we MEAT again. The sandwich left much to be desired, the bread was mediocre and the thinly sliced piece of cheese on my sandwich brought a tear to my eye. The kabanosy sausage tasted over processed but a bit tasty with all the garlic inside, but the after taste was not pleasing. I may make the trek to the Stanley's on Bell road but was hoping this place was the birth of the rumored Stanley's that was supposed to branch into 7 new stores. I can't say that I would return to this shop as it was not terrific. There was mention of European goodies like stuffed cabbage and some other dishes during the holidays but is this not the holidays? Turkey day is 3 days away? If I do return here it won't be for a sandwich but maybe some cold cuts, smoked butt and during the holidays. The young lady behind the counter said that Stanley's shared their recipes with them but the menu states that these are passed down through generations of Shannon's deli with no mention of Stanley's. Maybe when they get the smokehouse in the back of the building going they will offer the 60+ unique cuts they promise.\n\n*Update - I drove out to Stanley's on Bell Road, they advised me that So we meat again is not using their recipes or related to their establishment in any way. They also advised me that they are planning to reopen right across the street from their old location but did not quote a date.",1
"Ichi ban has pretty decent sushi. What really keeps me coming back here though is the half price sushi menu. I have had numerous bad experiences with their staff, as they are pretty disorganized and don't communicate well.However,  my friend and I keep coming though because we always enjoy the food and wallet friendly price at the end.",2
The food was average. I will not ever go back because customer service was horrible. There was this bald guy who was really rude to me and my friend today and seem as if he hated his job. If he the manager (not sure if he is one). He should work on his customer service skills.,0
"Seriously!? 4 STARS!?!?! \n\nSo it was Sam's big birthday...he was turning the BIG 2-1... ok who am I kidding... I just turned 21 for the X time. Anyway. \n\nI made reservations here and we showed up mildly on time... After hauling ass through the Venetian Canal Shoppes. We were seated and the ambiance was definitely 5 stars. The service was kick ass and prompt. \n\nThe servers were snazzy and sharp. The steak knives weren't. I had to saw through my darned steak. And it was \""supposedly\"" dry aged. My NY Strip was tough (at medium rare) and not as flavorful as I'd like it. Sam's Ribeye was definitely more tender, but I expected a better steak out of that price. My steak was slightly overcooked. Ok, so I guess it is a mistake to try Wolfgang Puck's steakhouse as he's not known to be a steak-person, but seriously. CUT's a steakhouse. How do you dare mess up on both of our steaks!?\n\nThe mushroom sides were great, sauteed spinach was perfect. Dessert was grand. Sadly, my slab of dead cow... not so much. :(",1
"Service is horrible. Sushi chefs are slow. Takes them 10 min just to make 1 roll! There was only 3 tables occupied and the waitress says \""sorry for the wait, we got busy all of a sudden\"". 3 tables is busy for a Friday night? Sushi was okay but nigiri had a lot of rice. Looking for a sushi spot? Don't go here...",0
"Went here because of DDD. Definitely a hole in the wall. I would recommend this place if you are hungry and thirsty. I imagine their drinks are very strong. The food though is definitely bar fair, so do not come here expecting a culinary adventure. If you come here starved then the food and portions will definitely satisfy.\n\nI ordered the Boli like I was supposed to, ordered the turkey and cheese one. I was a little disappointed because although the dough was delicious the filling of just cheese and turkey did not satisfy me...maybe some spinach or something?",2
"We had a really rough experience at this pool. \n\nFirst of all, it's really tough to find a seat with any shade. When we did find one under an umbrella it was shocking to see a sign saying you had to RENT a chair with shade for 50 bucks! Are you kidding me? I understand the whole renting an exclusive cabana concept but this was just a lounge chair with an umbrella! \n\nI guess it's the Vegas mentality and they are trying to take you for all you're worth. We also asked for a cup of water and were told they could only bring us a bottle, $7 for a small $9 for a large. It should be illegal to not provide water when it's 100 plus degrees.\n\nThe physical pool itself was fine, nice water features and a slide.",0
"I hate this place. We asked them if they would comp the drinks if we played the bar machines. They said you had to put at least $10 in, which is fair enough. I then tried to order Three Olives cake vodka with diet coke, and apparently they can only comp the garbage Smirnoff or Absolut. Are you kidding me?? They shoud be happy that anyone is even coming into this s**thole.",0
"First off, i am NOT anal at all. I am a server myself and i know how it feels and exactly what it is like. First timer at Hot n Juicy Crawfish. As i walked in by myself to check in for me and my family a party of 6 i was expecting to be attended to, a couple walked in at the same time as i did and \""Amber\"" decided she wanted to jot their name down on the waiting list, looked at me and walked away. I was standing for a good 5 minutes till someone approached and realized i haven't been helped. I was hoping not to have her as a server since i felt right off the back, i was gonna be dissatisfied with her service. And yes coincidentally she was. 6 or more right (speaks for its self) yeah. As what she made it seem (oh well tips included) We felt rushed while ordering and her attitude wasn't so pleasant. We felt as if \""gratuity\"" was included she didn't feel the need to attend to us. Although as i observed she was attending to every other table, taking new orders leaving us behind. Could be just \""our\"" table she happened to be a little \""careless\"" on but to top the not checking up on us at least, Took a while to get her attention to refill our drinks she refilled our drinks which was rasberry icetea with coke instead yuck! and my boyfriend had to go up to the counter himself twice for a refill of the \""right\"" soda. Didn't appreciate her attitude with the lack of horrible service. Her coworkers also mentioned \""again amber that's your 2nd time\"" not a good first time experience. Aside from that, food was good. Fries were just a bit soggy.",1

"I just don't think this place is very good.  We have been here four times, wife and I, all for lunch and once with our grandchildren and son's family for dinner.\n\nThe menu is strange with lots of items, but, to me, not many appealing items. And the quality of the meals, the plating and food is very common and average.  It is not distinctive in any way, good or bad, just nothing special.\n\nService is great and friendly.  Bar has all the usual goodies.\n\nWe no longer patronize.  As there are many other better and more interesting places around.",1
"The food is okay...\nWent there today, had been several times, asked for separate bills,the person I was with also asked for separate bills, the waitress came back again with the bill, she had written what the  amount was on the SAME bill, after asking twice for separate bills?  Said she could split it up between cards (we were paying cash?), finally I asked to see the manager and got the separate bills we had at this point asked for three times.  The food is fine, I guess, but what is the problem for having separate bills, also did not get refills on tea....or asked if we wanted or needed them.",1
"Heard about this place through my cousin and when we got there, the line was longggg! Pretty sure it was because of the hype around it cuz it was featured on Cake Boss.\n\nWhen you arrive there's a window that overlooks the kitchen. They were making napoleon's (my fav) so I knew that was what I was gonna get when I went to the front of the line.\n\nThe customer service was alright, felt rushed because there was so many people. Paid for a Large Italian Napoleon $6.95. Got it to-go because there was so many people. The napoleon was alright. There was wayyyyyyyyy to much filling, the cream/puff pastry was wayyy too off for me. \n\nHad a red velvet cupcake, your average good cupcake. Appealing to the eye but too much frosting to cake ratio. Had some cannoli and it was pretty bomb, but I still think everything they had was overpriced.\n\nOverall, 2.5 stars. The price was too high for the quality of the food.",1
"Three stars means A-OK and that's what this place is, OK. Not bad, not awesome, but halfway decent. \n\nI have to say that the service is very good. They're really friendly here and bend over backwards to make sure you are happy. It's a pretty small place but clean and comfortable with the fun lobster tank outside.\n\nWe basically came here because it was close by to the hotel and it was relatively cheap. There is certainly much better sushi to be had in Vegas and there is certainly much better AND more expensive sushi to be had. We wanted to keep things easy and cheap. \n\nThey have a good selection and all the usual suspects are present. Didn't see any particularly unusual or creative things on the menu but you've got your spicy tuna, salmon skin, rainbow rolls and all the rest. The fish was pretty fresh and it was presently nicely but it just lacked a \""Wow this is so delicious\"" factor. Salmon skin was a little fishy and the spicy tuna a little chewy and not as spicy as I would like. \n\nI do think it's an OK value if you are lazy and cheap and in the area but I wouldn't make any specific plans on coming here as it wasn't that good. Next time I would probably make the effort to go somewhere with better quality food for similar prices (even if it means not being so lazy and actually getting into a cab).",2
"Located in the most haunted graveyard of Edinburgh, this shop sure sells overpriced souvenirs. It's the stuff that would appeal to small kids or work perfectly as a joke, but to be fair most of the stuff you buy here will loose their novelty quickly and end up either at your local charity or at the back of your shelves. Basically, they are creepy and gory stuff you find in most \""scary\"" gift shops around the city, from plastic gooey eyeballs to witch puppets and spooky stories of Edinburgh. And there sure are plenty of stories!\n\nThe shop is certainly wee, and the staff are friendly enough, if not terribly bored to be surrounded by this gimmicky stuff. What works is that if you are after something along the lines I described above, then it all seems to be congregated in this one room just at the entrance of the graveyard.",1
"I heard about this place for years before I actually went in yesterday. It was disappointing. It ended up being a dark, humid, little sweatbox (note: bad smells!) of a coffee shop, with very little seating and terrible hours for a CenPho location (open til 3 on a Sunday...are you serious?). I ordered an Americano, which was actually quite tasty, but switched with my girlfriend because the Chai tea latte she ordered was subpar. Instead of a syrup or a powder, Drip just brews a bag of Chai and then adds milk. What you get is nothing like a Chai tea latte, but rather a milky tea that left me with gas for 16 hours. Skip this hangout.",1
"RIP OFFS...dishonest company, American home sheild set me up with this company...my motor was out, catus never checked my motor, they found a little dent in my garage door and told me that was the  problem and the moter was not covered becouse the dent made the motor burn out. that was a lie. I fired them andmgot QUALITY GARAGE DOOR to come out to check the problen.Quality garage door told me the dent did not cause my motor to go out.My motor was old and needed replacement. The motor was covered under warranty.  Just saying CATUS GARAGE DOOR ARE RIP OFFS.................",0
"Not open to the public! Only for the employees in the building. Don't trek out here in the snow and be disappointed like I did. \n\nTo be fair, I have no doubt that this place is a four or five star establishment for people in the building! But for the general public, this is a no star as it is a no-go.",0
"I ended up here a few weeks ago for a happy hour with some former co-workers.  We arrived at around 5 PM on a Thursday to find the restaurant and bar area fairly open.  The restaurant itself has an impressive locked beer room when entering its space and a dining room on one side of the restaurant and a bar with high top tables on another side.  Since we were only ordering appetizers and drinks, we decided to sit at one of the high tops.  Thankfully we were there during their happy hour and so were able to get half priced Belgian drafts and 50 cent buffalo bites.  Our waitress quickly came over and took our orders and when all was said and done I had tried some mozzarella wedges and buffalo bites as well as a few beers on draft.  The mozzarella wedges were decent but nothing special and I was not a huge fan of the buffalo bites either.  It wasn't that the flavor wasn't good but they seemed to be somewhat overcooked and so not that great.  We also ended up staying past the end of happy hour and so our last beers were what I consider to be extremely overpriced.  Overall it was not a memorable trip to the Bistro.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I will probably be back in the future but not necessarily by my choice.  They easily have the best selection of beer in the city proper and their food is good as well, I only wish that it wasn't so expensive.",2
too much salt- house wine is poor- they are close to being good- a little more effort please\nthe sole was previously frozen and prepped off site ( or made very poorly) very mushy. It had the tast of a commerically made dish- soggy and old.\nLay off the salt- make more of an effort on the white fish,2
"I not sure what to make of this place - Kampong Ah Lee is a very traditional Malasian take aways and diner which serves big portions of what I can only assume are traditional Malasian dishes - they are very tasty and more than something different if you seem to always be eating Chinese take away and need something different, I cant remember the name of what I had to eat, but it was full of prawns and possibly even chicken and had lots of noodels cooked into it and spices. Yum!\n\nThe trouble is though that even with the big portions of good food, the price of this place is expensive. Also, staff are a bit on the grumpy side, but that is just a minor annoyance.",2
"The person working in this shoe repair shop is completely incompetent.  I took a pair of Christian Louboutin's ($1,200) and a pair of Valentino ($900) for a rubber sole to protect the bottom of the shoes.  Not only the work was over priced ($50) but also, they completely ruined my shoes!  They put the rubber sole half way up the back of the shoes when they were supposed to put the rubber sole on the BOTTOM of the shoe only.  I can't no longer wear either pair because they look cheap, fake, and ridiculous with a cut off piece of rubber glued to the back of the shoes.  I wouldn't care if this happened to a pair of inexpensive shoes; but I trusted this store with my designer shoes and they did not care for them.  I confronted the repair man and he stone walled me as if it wasn't his problem or his fault. I feel I just flushed over $2000 that I paid for these two pairs of shoes down the toilet.",0
"This is for the one in St. Mark's Square, although I'm sure it's the same product for the one in the food court just off the casino.\n\nI got the Limoncello gelato, which was ok. The gelato was lemony without tasting like artificial lemon and was kind of creamy. It's a little overpriced for the amount that you get, but that's half expected from anything on the strip. \n\nI may give some of the other flavors a try at some point in the future.",1
"I'm going to start by saying I'd have slapped Delux a third star if my burger wasn't so god damned over cooked.  I'm a meat-a-holic (that sounded naughty) and I know what I like.  Fa-reaking rare;  cook the \""moo\"" out and we're good to go. \n\nMy sammy was chared on the outside, gray-ish pink on the inside.  Tell Mr. Krabs to fire spongebob and get a wage monkey that can handle temperature orders. (I'd so work here)\n\nAll that being said,  the restaurant was nice, though I was sat at the community table (what is with THIS fucking trend? I don't want to sit on a strangers lap...hmmm....) and even though my meat was nuked, it did have some good flavor.  I shall return to Delux in search  of redemtion.  For them.  Yeaaaah.",1
"I'm not sure which came first, Postino's or St. Francis but I am a long-time fan of Postino's so the first thing I thought when my family and I went to St. Francis is \""Oh, Postino's wanna-be\"". My opinion wasn't too far off as far as the air of hipster/yuppiness that exudes through the vestibule definitely screams Postino's while you wait for a table but as far as quality of service, you St. Francis, are definitely no Postino's. \n\nOur server made a major push at the upsell of a combination appetizer and when we agreed to it, he forgot to bring it to us! I had ordered a soup/salad/1/2 sandwich entree for lunch, and he forgot the soup. When he did bring it after being reminded, it was lukewarm. He kept forgetting to bring refills as well. It was like he was in another world. We ended up being comped quite a bit off of our bill because of simple mistakes because what's the point in being served lukewarm soup or an appetizer at the end of your meal? And he was NOT new! I am very forgiving of new servers and this guy kept telling us how he's worked at St. Francis for 2 years and how much he loves it there....so whatever his problem was that day, it definitely affected our meal and our potential to return.\n\nThe saving grace was that the food was really delicious. I had the Del Real sandwich, my son had pig dip, my other \""son\"" had French Onion burger, my \""son's girlfriend had the forbidden rice bowl. All were really nicely done, fresh, served at the right temperatures (with the exception of the aforementioned soup), etc. I just wish the service had been better. \n\nMaybe we'll go back..maybe I'll just go to Postino's. I guess we'll see the next time we are \""in the neighborhood.\""",2
"They have beer tap variety. They have shuffle board and pool tables which is awesome. The location is not in a popular place. I only notice it because it's on the way to where I live which is 5 minutes away,driving. I never tried the food. My experience was at 1am. It was empty and the bartender seemed agitated because the 3 of us were indecisive on what beer to drink. I only would come back here because I live near by.",1
"The rooftop deck is a nice touch in the friendlier seasons, but the food could be better. They have a decent happy hour with cheap mixed drinks, house wines, etc.. The chipotle salsa we ordered was good and definitely repeatable. The chips were thick and strong--perfect for dipping into guacamole, which was unfortunately subpar. The avocados must not have been ripe enough and were stringy.\n\nMy fish tacos came on double corn tortillas which I approve of, with a side of rice and beans. The tacos themselves were only \""meh\"" however, same for the rice. The beans were pretty good.\n\nOverall, my feelings are mixed about Steel Cactus. It has potential, but currently is just a good place to get a drink, salsa, and enjoy the nice weather. The food quality could use improvement.",2
"don't do it.\n\nthe margaritas were watery, the chicken wrap was so bland i couldn't eat the other half, they were out of fried oysters, and the service was a bit slow.\n\nthe best part of my experience at san felipe's cantina was the fact that i got to enjoy watching football while not enjoying my meal.\n\nthere you have it. short and to the point. there are so many better options in the tempe marketplace.",0
"This was my first time at Cafe Boa and I happened upon it while looking for a late morning breakfast place. Bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry. No butter or jam was offered. We had to ask for it. \n\nOne of my big pet peeves: memorizing orders. I'd rather you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up. Of course our server did. He forgot our orange juice and I had to ask for it. I was really in the mood for what was advertised on the menu as \""Fresh Squeezed OJ\"". A large glass of OJ was brought to the table but if it was Tropicana, they'd be doing at least better than they were. It wasn't fresh squeezed. I asked our server about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender, etc. and sounded surprised. Big mistake to be blaming others. So he finally brings back fresh squeezed and it's a glass about a third the size of of the original.\n\nThe food overall was tasty and hot. No complaints there. Service seems to be on par with the other reviews. Our chucklehead was no exception. When he did bring the bill, it was only a total and no itemized bill. Had to ask for that too. I wonder if he'll figure out he'll save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time?",1
"A lot of people I know really go mad for this place - but while I am not as big a chocolate fan as they may be, I really dont see the appeal of this place.\n\nChocolate Soup is basically a cafe that serves all of its dishes with a chocolate infused something or other, or a chocolate coated do-dah. Oh, and you can have a side order of a chocolate muffin and a chocolate latte to drink. You see my point.\n\nThe idea must be a good one however, as this place is always full - and I can see why, the food is actually very very nice, including the actual chocolate soup you can buy. The trouble is that it really is all a bit too much, and I could help but feel a little sick after I left here. The food is just too chocolate-y for my taste.\n\nThe staff werent bad, and to give them thier due, it was a packed weekend lunchtime, so I really couldnt fault them.",2
"Gotta love Tazza D'Oro.\n\nThis place is by far the best coffee within a ten minute walk of Carnegie Mellon... though that isn't saying much. The wait staff is very friendly and the coffee is A-OK!\n\nOccasionally the coffee has an oiliness to it, which typically means the beans aren't fresh, but overall I'm satisfied. The hot sandwiches and soup are the most edible thing on campus and the pastries are amazing. If the prices were a TINY bit lower I would give the place 4 stars.",2
"Now for fast food I must say El Apollo Loco is one of my favorites, but my visit today fell short of expectations,  got the 1/2 chicken combo for $10, but I think the chicken was malnourished, cause it was so small I left hungry.  also had the pinto beans amid broccoli which was tasty.   as for the chicken it was over cooked and dry, such a shame.  I would probably come here more often, but have had same issue before.  this location is the closest to my home and still drive 15+ miles to get my El Apollo loco fix.   glad they are opening a new one in the Goodyear area.  let hope quality/quantity is better.\n\nNow for the service the staff is very friendly and prompt, that is one of the reason I have continued to come back. If this stars were based on service only they would have got 5 stars,  but because of cost vs. quantity I will not go higher.\n\nEl Apollo loco get bigger pieces of chicken, your price of a meal is not on the cheap side so stop getting such small chickens",1
"I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and Los Rubios that is right around the corner from my house was closed. So I went here instead. Service was fast, however the burrito was marginal at best. I ordered the 'Breakfast Burrito', which had eggs, ham and pico de gallo. I was try to eat this and drive to work. \n\nBad idea!\n\nI had some 'juice' from within the burrito running down my forearm and onto my jeans. I wasn't happy about this. So I had to fashion the paper bag around the wax paper wrap to catch said 'juice'.\n\nThe only thing from here that I can say has been consistently good would be the super nachos. After I typed the last sentence, I realized, every time I had the super nachos were after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, which could be why it was good.",1
"The last time I played Bingo was when I was a teen in Ohio hanging with my friend and her mom. Her mom had the trolls and lineup of bingo \""cards\"" on newsprint, and bingo markers. She was as serious as the old ladies in the room, but after observing the strange rituals I was bored after a few rounds. \n\nBingo here is a whole new level. The same older players (along with a bunch of younger ones), but a very Vegas experience. \n\nThe bingo caller, or whatever, looked like she was ready for a press conference, with the professional sound equipment.  The numbers appear on electronic boards high on the walls.  \n\nI sat at the bingo machine. You get a packet, enter the number from your receipt, then sit back as the caller calls out everyone's numbers but yours. A young woman won 17,000.00 and another won $1000 or more. There were a smattering of $5 to $15 winners. \n\nI found the process slow and...unengaging? Distant? The machines made me feel useless.  Maybe I'd enjoy using the papers. The setup was uncomfortable, with little knee room, and the caller was slow as molasses, too, and having a single person circle the room to verify all the winners left looooong gaps between some rounds. I'd have to be retired and bored to come here again. It's a cool looking room, though.",2
"Las Vegans pass by Terrible Herbst locations every day. But have you ever really taken a look at their stores? From the circa 1980's style lettering on the outside to dull, dingy, boring, cramped, and sometimes downright dirty stores on the inside I wonder how on earth they stay in business? Actually I think they've got it figured it out. They put 2 on each corner along busier streets like a bottom feeder net to try and scoop up any traffic they can get. This location has a twin on the North side of Sunset as proof of concept. Terribles is one of the worst C-stores I've ever stepped foot in and this location in particular is a dump. To get to the gas pumps you get to run the gauntlet of cars leaving Wendys, the car wash, or especially WalMart who cut through the gas pumps like NASCAR cup racers going for the championship. If you do get to a pump the pumps themselves are dirty. The button pads to punch in your credit / debit card info are torn or missing. But while pumping gas you can occasionally get some free entertainment thanks to the Henderson PD busting speeders and illegal U-Turns from the parking lot. \n\nIf you go inside the staff is always nice, but the place is cramped, stacked, and packed so that you get that nice canned sardine feeling. I flat refuse to get a fountain drink here, the self serve options just creep me out. And the bathroom? Ugh, I think I'll skip that part. \n\nIf you just have to stop for gas, or get something to drink it's barely tolerable. But if there's ever a poster child for why Terrible Herbst should invest in some upgrades and maybe some cleaning supplies, this location is it. \n\n2 Stars and that's only because the employees provide good service.",1
"Honey, I shrunk the candy shop!\n\nBack when Smeeks was at Central and Camelback, it offered a large selection of retro candies and unusual handmade candies, along with novelties. The store in The Union at Biltmore is still utterly adorable, but it's less than half the size, and it's more a novelty store than a candy store. It's also probably closer to a 5-star experience on one's very first visit, when the sheer exuberance of the place is delightful.\n\nRetro candies are on the small back wall and include candy bars I don't recall seeing at the candy store on Mill Avenue. Retro is where the action is here, possibly because it goes with the retro charm of many of the novelties.\n\nThere are bins of taffy. There is a wall display of manufactured candies and then the tables have a few artisanal items of the marshmallow, caramel, and candy bark varieties. The suppliers may rotate, as the chi-chi caramels I tried and liked in June did not appear to be the same chi-chi caramels offered in December, though both brands had a spicy chile version (which you, too, should try).\n\nThere's been a good deal of Archie McPhee catalog action to stock the novelty section, including embrace of the current trend for fixating on mustaches. Now that the Green Parrot is a dead parrot, this is the only place I know in Phoenix to buy any frivolities of this ilk, so I wish they'd go for the full McPhee and stock the action figures and bacon products.\n\nIf you think of this as a frivolous little gift shop amidst the high consumerism of Biltmore Fashion Park, it works quite well. If you'd be happy to find any sort of retro candy, it's still #1, thanks to slippage among its rivals. If you're looking for a large variety of candies like the shop used to have, be prepared for a bit of frustration.",2
"Disclaimer: I'm from Vancouver and have not been immersed in Mexican food my entire life. But, I do know good food from bad food, and our last meal was not good food.\n\nI ordered the vegetarian quesadillas. On the menu, it states they are grilled vegetable quesadillas. I love smoky grilled veg and was really excited for my meal. \n\nYeah... they weren't grilled. They took a cheap, mixed bag of generic veg (carrots and celery, REALLY?), sauteed them in some butter, and popped them on a tortilla with cheap, nasty cheese. They didn't even cut them all the way through.\n\nService was good once our server got to us. We were left at our table for a solid 10 minutes before our server came by to grab drink orders and bring chips and salsa. I like the patio with the water feature out back.\n\nOverall, disappointing experience that doesn't warrant a return visit.",1
"Back in the day I used to drive all the way from Surprise to eat here, yes the food was that good. They used to have the most killer Pollo Fundido as well as amazing chunky salsa. \n\nTime has certainly changed this place.. we started with a cheese crisp with green chiles, delicious.. nice and crispy with just the right amount of chile strips.. also ordered their killer chunky salsa which was as good as I remember it. \n\nThen come my Pollo Fundido swimming, Im serious about this, swimming in a pool of grease!! They didn't even bother draining the thing before tossing it onto my plate. Was disgusting too, not even like clear oil but dark brown grease. Vile. Then the Misters Sampler showed up.. this thing was a fucking mess! You couldn't tell what was what under the piles of sauce and lettuce until you took a bite. Mini chimis were burnt, mini tacos burnt, tamales, cold and hard.. was a complete wreck. \n\nAfter a few bites we called it.. major loss of appetite.. a shame too cause the salsa was actually really good but the entrees were inedible. \n\nMeanwhile, the Mister was attached to the toilet within a few hours of eating here.. he was sick all day the next too.. so word of caution, eat here at your own risk.\n\nIm sure going to miss the good meals I used to have here, what a real shame.",0
"OK, if you want a new experience on the great hamburger, this is a very cool place to try for sure.  Gourmet burgers with an Asian Flair, great fries with a different twist.\n\n1.  Ambiance - Very nice in a small tucked away corner in a non discript dopey strip mall that really has nothing to offer other than this place.  Kind of out of the way actually.  Has a small feeling but nice and warm overall.\n\n2.  Service -  Had a young/ new server, but he seemed to know his stuff. Clearly the place is very proud of their vision and their offerings. I would be too.  However, they were closed on Valentines for reservations only dinners, which is ODD for a place that does NOT take reservations. Then, on Presidents day, they decided to open on the Monday, which is normally a closed day for them and then they closed on Tuesday. Twice I went there and they were closed. I consider this a bit arrogant, but they can be for sure!!!\n\n3.  Food - Wow, very tasty and the asian fusion is really cool and nice. Tastes are very good.You can even do without the bun and still the taste rocks.  Ronin Burger, Kiki Burger, Kalbi Burger,, all great. The non traditional ice teas are a bit \""much\"" meaning, that they have a strong and odd taste compared to norm. Desserts are great and find out the specials of the day before you order your main dish, to resever whatever is the special.  Oh yeah, all the fries were great.  \n\n4.  Price -  For six of us with three desserts, the total came out to $120.00. I find that a bit steep for a gourmet burger and even though the kids enjoyed the taste, it was the most awesome thing for their palates.\n\n5.  Overall - this is an experience and you need to try this place for sure, however, it is not a place I am going to pop into all the time. Why?  A bit expensive, a bit pretentious, but still a quality establishment regardless!  \n\nI will go back, but after I save some money!",2
"If you're looking for bang for your buck and by that I mean HUGE portions, this is a quality place to eat.  While there are definitely other places on the strip with higher quality, more flavorful food, most of them aren't offering portions this size.\n\nI had  the Sage Fried Chicken and a Bloody Mary.  The Bloody Mary was the first one I've ever tried and it was delicious.  Peppery, with the perfect amount of Vodka mixed in.  The fried chicken was average and the bacon waffle was a little disappointing.  They basically throw a bunch of full pieces of bacon into the batter, throw it in the waffle iron and call them bacon waffles.  Good try, but the waffles just didn't have the flavor that I was looking for.\n\nIt wasn't a bad meal by any means though.  For the price, I definitely feel like I got my money's worth and I wouldn't be against coming back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.",2
"Used to be our favorite place to stay in Vegas...  THE Hotel is now Delano.  It's currently undergoing construction and during fight week no less.  We were not informed that we would hear pneumatic drills and jackhammers not only in our room, but in the hallways it's SO loud people are walking covering their ears!  We were put in one of the updated rooms that will be Delano, we hated it.  We come to Vegas to relax and loved the dark, romantic setting that THE Hotel had offered, now it's white on white Miami style...not very relaxing.  We were also promised a pool view, we got no pool view but a rooftop and a parking lot.  We asked to be moved to THE Hotel...not Delano..which they did and we got a strip view which was better.  THE Hotel does definitely need to be updated, just not to the contemporary modern Miami white.  We will be staying somewhere else next time.  I hear the jackhammer in my room as I'm writing this. Hotels should be required to disclose that they are under construction, or will be at the time of your stay!",1
"I build my own stir-fry and I had the veggies with noodles.  The service is quick and the staff are very friendly. I had left overs and I had it to go. Make sure to ask for a bag to place your to-go box, because the sauce from your food will leak and you don't want to wear it on your shirt or spill all over your car. \n\nNice place to eat Chinese food!",2
"After all the Obama hype, we thought we'd try DeMarco's.  I drove 20 minutes to get there from Northwest LV.  That's OK, I knew it would be a drive.  I ordered a large pepperoni to go.  When I arrived, they gave me a pizza with all sorts of veggies on it.  Not a pepperoni in sight.  I said that's not what I ordered.  The girl sort of argued with me saying she didn't take the order but that this was a New York pizza.  I said I didn't care who took the order or what you called it, this wasn't a pepperoni pizza.  She went away, came back and said it would be a few minutes.  OK, mistakes happen.  They were playing \""Dark Side of the Moon\"" so they got exact points from me!  While I waited, several people got pizzas to go.  The girl at the front opened each box and showed them their pizzas.  Each one had a black, burned-beyond-belief crust.  Everyone said, \""Great, thanks!\""  and left with their pies.  I couldn't believe it.  So I was ready when they brought mine out.  I guess since they \""rushed\"" mine out, it didn't have time to be burned.  It tasted just OK, but way overpriced at $20 for a single topping.  Don't think I'll go back.",0
"We went here recently right before a 2-day, 150-mile bike ride to carbo-load. The food was okay - probably what we should have expected for the low prices - but the service was horrible. It was not busy, but we could not get our waitresses attention despite multiple attempts. We needed a refill and asked for one when she took our dinner order, and reminded her when our dinner arrived. We were finally able to flag her down 10 minutes later to remind her again. It also took about 20 minutes to get the check after we had FINISHED our entrees. I am sure that not all of the servers are that bad, but I'm not sure I will be back to find out.",1
"Having been to Samba a number of times since discovering it only a month or so ago, I can say it is one of my favorite places to eat in all of Madison if you are in a mood for unlimited food! Over time [as of 2014 now] the quality seems to have gone down in the food but the overall atmosphere and service is great.\n\nThe beginning salad bar is fantastic, you have to try the potatoes to start.  After the salad bar you are served all the meat you can eat, which in my opinion more than makes up for the price.  I honestly think that everyone should give Samba a try if they are in Madison at anytime just for the grilled pineapple and tapioca rolls!  If you have a large appetite there is no reason why you haven't had Samba yet.",2
"Talk about a Hoedown!  I am not sure I have ever seen so much redneck, hillbilly and whitetrash in the same place.  I think I even saw a few actual cowboys hahah!  Country Thunder definitely has some high quality people watching!  This is some strange cross between Mardi Gras and Spring Break in the middle of nowhere in the desert, the only problem is tents don't leave much to the imagination... It was entertaining for sure!  Our camping neighbors were awesome and it was a very communal atmosphere!  I am not sure what I think about limited shower access around dust, sweat, and tons of people...  Oh and there was some great country music!  I have a whole new respect for Toby Keith; he knows how to have a party.  I would say I broke in my boots dancing and had a blast with my girlfriends!  I am not sure I will be back, but it was definitely a fun time that  I will never forget!",2
"The Orleans is host to many many different types of shows and events. The rooms are larger than average and are clean which is a must! The casino has a very energetic vibe and has many restaurants to choose from which are all very very good. Theres a movie theater, bowling, live music and many bars. Its almost as if they don't want you to leave the property!\n\nIt is a very good deal and you will enjoy your stay. I enjoyed my last 6 stays",2
"I'm SO SO SO  tired of seeing expired food on their shelves. \n\nWas in here on Friday evening to get some ground turkey, they had several packages of ground turkey that had expired 3 DAYS prior. Informed the cashier telling him that I was tired of finding expired meat on their shelves. His response??? \""I am too.\"" WTF?\n\nAsked for a manager so Brad the manager came over. Told him about the expired meat on the shelves and his response was to tell me that employees check the dates everyday so there couldn't possibly be old meat on the shelf. I insisted there were several packages of old meat on the shelf and he just replied \""Well, we'll get it removed\"" and then walked back to the lotto counter. He never called anyone up to remove it, never got on the phone to ask someone in the back to do it, just continued to stand at the counter. \n\nWhen I shop, I like to get FRESH meat to feed my family. This wasn't the first, second, 3rd time this has happened to me here.\n\nSO.OVER.THIS.PLACE.",0
"We've made it back to Sushi Kaya a couple times after my first review and unfortunately, the place has slowly gone downill, but their prices sure haven't.\n\nOur most recent visit was this past Sunday.  Granted, it was Christmas night, the place was busy, but they had a few empty tables. We did the AYCE option and started ordering off the bat.  Each time our server took an order, she would miss a couple things, then would later make an excuse of:\n\n1) \""We ran out, because it's been so busy tonight!\"" -Whatever, we were there at 9pm, you're open for another 5-hours lady, what you gonna do then?!?\n2) \""The kitchen is really busy.\"" -Is that really my problem?\n3) Or simply, just ignoring the request by smiling instead. -Sorry lady, it's too late to play that no Engrish front on me.\n\nIn total, she failed on SIX plates due to one of the above reasons.  Sorry, that's not going to cut it, so I took it out of her tip.\n\nArigato Sushi Kaya...or should I really say, \""Annyonghi Kaseyo\"" (sp?), it was great while it lasted but, it's off to find a better AYCE sushi spot in the LV.",1
"Salty Senorita has awesome atmosphere, easy location w/ tons of parking and is probably best for a happy hour and drinking spot. Their menu leaves a lot to be desired, and their restaurant appears to be infested with flies... I didn't have the best experience, but did have an OK time since the atmosphere is cool. I would go back with a big group, but I won't be back for dinner or lunch, specifically. \n\nTIPS\nGreat cheap happy hour\n$1 shots\nQueso dip is good\nLots of parking",1
"I don't see the need to ever go to this place unless you are flying in or out of the Deer Valley Airport and you just got off the longest flight in the history of flights and there was no food on board.  The buffet is just kinda gross.  They advertise a fish fry on Wednesdays and Fridays, but I don't see how they feel confident standing by their advertised fish fry.  It's just kinda gross.  The fried cod was too breaded and the fish didn't seem fresh or prepared right.  The lasagna was good, but not worth revisiting this place for.  I also sampled the shrimp cocktail (which was ok, but may have given me the shits), fried shrimp (bleh), fried chicken (ok), their soups (weren't very good), chocolate cake (crappy and stale tasting), rice pudding (barely ok),  and the table bread was fresh and nice (so stock up on that shit).\n\nOh, and not a fan of their salad bar either really.  Sorry Deer Valley Airport restaurant (although really I think you should be apologizing to me), but I'll never be coming back.",0
"The food is okay here...the dealbreaker though was the lousy service.  After I finished my  meal, I kept calling out to the bartender for my check.  That inept moron just kept walking right by as if I didn't even exist.  He wasn't even busy!  I suspect that he was deliberately ignoring me.  I waited a good fifteen minutes before brining me my check and when I didn't tip him for his lousy service, he actually threatened me.  I've reported this incident a few times to the Omni Hotel and to the corporate website.  \n\nBottom line: Avoid this place at all costs.  The Terrace Room has the most rude waitstaff ever!!",0
"Was looking forward to a good dinner for the wifes bday. She placed the order 50 minutes before the scheduled pick up. Still had to wait 25 minutes more once I got there. The customer service, or lack there of sucked. It was good food, but won't return to this one because of the service.",0
"I was so excited to try El Burro because I like the round corner so much. Well it's sad to say I do not feel the same way about this place. I had the shrimp burrito, the contents were soupy. As u could imagine it was very sloppy and runny. I ordered chips & guac as well. How could you go wrong there. I got home and opened the bag to see the chips were drenched in oil. I mean like everytime I touched a chip my fingers were glistening! I will post a pick of the bag of chips an 2hours later. i love homemade chips but they need to lay these out in a draining bin before they bag them. Very disappointing. Maybe the were just having an off day, but I don't know if I will gather the courage to try again.",0
"It's so scary! Bleeding eyes!\n\nNot sure when circus themes were ever deemed \""okay\"" but I find Circus Circus blatantly horrific, from the huge menacing clown on their sign to the gaudy[1] interior.\n\nIt's a casino, though, and their minimum table bets are reasonable for those who aren't high-rollers. Adventuredome's fun for children, but besides that, it doesn't FEEL like a safe place (read: clowns are menacing) - why would you bring kids there (or even to Vegas)? Don't be a bad parent/guardian!\n\nIf you hate clowns, Circus Circus is not for you! Your mileage may vary.\n\n[1] Even by casino standards.",0
"The pharmacy has had a staff overhaul. Experience has not been the same. The current pharmacy is not as helpful, friendly or professional as the previous staff members and they are somewhat rude. One instance, the Pharmacy tech was ringing me up, I was trying to ask him a question, but he was yelling to another tech across the back area about nothing that pertained to the current situation or that couldn't wait two mins to finish our transaction. Hopefully it will change around. \nStill, I have changed to the CVS down the street 7th St & Indian School. They are quicker and more professional which is much appreciated!",0
"Being a Greek himself, my husband knows good Greek food.  We both agree the food  here is delicious. \nHowever, I called on 3 X in 2 days to place a catering order.

"We were very excited when we saw this establishment had new ownership.  The location is fantastic and the restaurant is clean; however, we will not be back for several reasons.  First, they need to seriously work on the menu.  It is not very expansive and I have not been excited about any items I ordered (out of three visits).  In addition, I was hoping the draught beer selection would be better.  Due to food and beer selection, I will be spending my money up the street at Temple Bar.",1
"If you genuinely care about the well being of your animal companion, do not take them here. It's unfortunate that this is the 24/7 clinic that is closest to me, but they have have no idea what they are doing. I brought my dog in for surgery on the same wound twice because of their mistakes and they flat out told me they don't know what to do, printed out my records for me and reccomend I visit another vet. The lack of\nintelligence in their profession is embarrassing and I am very upset with them doing work on my dog and finding out they had no idea what they were doing the whole time. Disgusting.",0
"I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \n\nFood: \n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\n\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. \n\nWill I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first.",2
"I stayed at the Green Valley recently for a work trip.  Overall, it was a nice stay -- the place is enormous, staff were all friendly, room was large and clean, and the District next door has some great restaurants to choose from if you don't want to eat in the hotel.\n\nMinor annoyances: the internet connection in the room was spotty, and the gym doesn't open until 6am (my body clock was on East coast time and I really would have liked to get in there earlier).\n\nMy biggest takeaway is that this resort isn't sure what it wants to be, and who they want to cater to.  The decor of the hotel and casino reminded me of a Tuscan style -- lots of tan tile and stone, wrought iron, etc - which appeals to a much older crowd as evidenced by the large number of retirees in the casino.  But the pool area is the opposite -- sleek, modern, hip, full of 20-somethings getting drunk and tan.  It made me laugh to walk with much older folks through the casino and see big posters for the weekly \""Brazilian beach party\"", with photos of young girls in teeny weeny bikinis.\n\nOverall, if you want to stay in the Vegas area without being right on the Strip, Green Valley is a good place to stay.  If you can get a decent rate, it's a good deal.",2
"I KNOW now that some flavors are better than others.\n\nI took a bite out of my husbands cinnamon cupcake,it was OK not too sweet, sort of moist and about the right amount of spice. It tasted like a cinnamon bun.\n\nBUT THE LEMON one was disappointing and half of it got tossed in the trash. The top had a candy decoration that was so hard I almost broke my teeth on it so I spit it out. (maybe I wasn't suppose to eat it???) The frosting had lemon in it but was AS SWEET AS EATING STRAIGHT 10X SUGAR from the bag (it really tasted like straight 10x sugar with a little bit of lemon rind ) . I love sweets and IF I SAY THIS WAS TOO SWEET it was since it's like a mouse saying something like there is too much cheese in the cheese trap, it's THE SAME thing . I tried the frosting and the cake together, it still didn't work to me .  The main taste in the cake part of my lemon cupcake was EGG it was like egg flavored cake . The cupcake had almost no lemon flavor but it was moist. \n\nI would NEVER eat a lemon cupcake from here again and it was a mess to park here.",1
"I want to give this between 3-4 stars\n\nEveryone told me that \""we had to go\"" - admittedly, I was very excited, I had read the cookbook and seen the wonderful pictures of the food.\n\nBut to be honest, I was not blown away.  The oysters were delightful - done escargot style and we had the fried foie gras - which was silly and too rich and the cote de bouef which was fantastic but HUGE. But I guess I was expecting a more french touch - subtler, nuanced flavors.  I was v happy that I went - and nothing was wrong with the food - just not a must have.  Nothing that any decent restaurant in Brooklyn isnt doing.",2
"So I should of expected a higher price due to it being in a casino so I am not going to complain about the food portion vs price. My sandwich was a philly steak it was ok but not worth the money. It tasted more like steakum meat then fresh steak. My husband paid 10 for a single cheeseburger and fries and the burger was a frozen patty and tasted like one. The cashier was very transactional which I find odd with this being a tourist town. I don't think I would order a meal from here again but I def want to try one of their deserts they looked fresh and tasty and the size is enough for two people. A suggestion too would be to get some cheesewiz for your cheesesteak it will help with the flavor. I don't mind paying more for food from casinos because that is the norm, I just don't like when I pay more and am not happy with my food.",1
I was excited to eat here after reading all the great reviews I was soooo ready to eat what many people said was one of the best meals ever. Before my food arrived I was given some bread to munch on and it looked really good I took one bite and remembered Patricks review of the dough tasting like tap water. Patrick was right.  The pizza dough tasted the same and I was crushed. Is there something wrong with me and Patrick? Why doesn't everyone else taste what we taste? I will be going back to try out the entrees and I will update my review,1
"I can not speak of the food that I was told had great flavor and huge portions for the price.  45 minutes to an hour for a table, after 8 at night.  We went across the street to the Eastside Cannery buffet. \n\nIn town for a last minute wedding and since only staying for one night, we figured this place would be okay. \n\nThe casino is TINY and to say it is smokey is an understatement.   I honestly think the restaurant is larger than the gaming area.  Hard to play slots when older people are playing two or three machines at the same time.\n\nUpon checking in, we were told all of the rooms have new mattresses.  They might be new, but they are HORRIBLE.   Honestly,  the floor has more padding under the horribly stained carpet.\n\nIn room bathrooms are tiny. Ironic that they are tiny,  because instead of toilet paper holder being next to toilet, it is on the opposite wall.  But hey, at least you get your morning stretching done while reaching for toilet paper.\n\nTaking a shower is scary.\nWater temperature level is a choice of slowly boil your flesh off or instantly boil your flesh off.  I didn't even try to bathe my 9 month old son out of fear of causing serious injury.   \n\nOur room was on the backside of the hotel and I was kept awake most of the night by a fight in the neighborhood which is a stone's throw away. \n\nAmounts to...it is a place to shower and sleep, but you can't do either one comfortably here.  True case of you get (or don't get really,) what you pay for.",0
"This place is much bigger than it looks from the outside. The selection is quite large and they have many different items and categories of items. I bought a $10 clip on side purse for my lady. But I found a much better quality one at a competitor so I took it back within two weeks with the receipt. They would not give me my money back, only a store credit which is what most stores will give you if you can't prove you bought it there.\n\nSo don't buy any Christmas gifts, or Birthday gifts or any gifts that you may want to return because these folks won't give you your money back.\n\nShop at one of their many competitors.",1
"\""Put some south in yo mouth\"" Boooyaaa~\n\nPretty darn good BBQ. I had the pulled pork sandwich, the meat was tender and I could really taste the hickory smoke. The sauce was thick and tangy (yes I went a little overboard with it). I got corn on the cob for the side and it was a little bland, as if it had been boiled too long. My friend opted for the catfish and I snuck a few bites, it was not over-breaded, just a thin light dusting and super juicy inside, next time I am going to order it. I had an ice tea and it was so strong I had to add water to it (which I love). Overall this was a great lunch and although I ate so much I almost put myself in a food coma I will definitely be back.",2
Worst steak ever. Kona dry aged steak was awful. Ordered med rare and got med to med well. They said it was lighting and tried using a spot light to convince me otherwise. It was chewy as leather and there were tendons that were not melted in high enough heat. Go to grand lux instead for their ribeye or the food court next door.,0
"Bad, just bad! Slow service, calamari was frozen, my girlfriend had the chicken bruschetta an the chicken was so rubbery she couldn't eat it, an came with ore Ida sweet potato fries fresh from the walk in freezer. I had the pork tenderloin an it's covered in cheap ass onion strings, it came with mashed potatoes covered in wilted bok choy lettuce that was made two days prior to me ordering it, pork was undercooked an drowning in some sorta gravy. I can't believe a line cook could send food out like this. We wanted to send it back but our waitress didn't check on us till 20mins after we got our food, an we had a movie to catch. Meal ended up costing $50 an we always tip 20% so $60 bucks for a below average meal. The 2 stars is for location an the look of the place. We won't be back.",1

"I like what HMShost is trying to do here by bringing in more up to date attractions/restaurants to combat the negative review in 2012 stating SkyHarbor as one of the worst places to get a bite. \nThe hostess was sweet. We opted to sit at the bar, as it was very crowded. After being ignored by the bartender, my husband got up to ask the hostess if we could sit at a recently vacated table. She obliged, just in time too, because after her got up, one of the bartenders left the beer tap on directly in front of his seat and beer started to over flow on to the rail and on to my Husbands phone. I caught it in time. \nAt the table, and our server was Jake. He was pretty awkward. Husband ordered the chicken wrap, I ordered Testosterone salad and we split a mac and cheese. Jake turned around before I could tell him how I wanted my steak cooked. Husband ended up liking his wrap. Chips were good. The Mac and cheese was ok. But my steak was borderline still mooing. I sent it back and got the green side salad. Turns out I don't like blue cheese. Or maybe I don't like how much of it was in the salad. Either way, not impressed. My water glass went empty for he second half of the entire meal. And my husbands coke was only filled when the hostess (yes, not the server) asked me if I wanted to send back the salad, then she took my replacement order. \nGo to McDonalds instead....I feel like I say that a lot. And I haven't been to McDs in yrs...so take that for what it's worth. Ha",1
"Beautifully designed, wait staff very nice but the food although it looked fantastic tasted awful. We had the edamame and tuna poke to start both I would highly suggest. From there it went down hill the cocktails were so strong you could hardly sip them. My husband had the bamboo roll, my daughter the spicy tuna roll, and I had the Godzilla roll. The rolls looked appetizing but tasted day old at best. The seaweed was wet and chewy and the cream cheese inside the rolls must have been generic because it had no taste to it at all. Great location, great concept, poorly executed with low quality ingredients.",0
"I'm going to keep this short and to the point.  Went once, would not go back.   It probably doesn't earn three stars but it is better than two stars so I'm generously giving them three.  I had pulled pork buns, beef buns and miso ramen.  The food is overly salty, all of it.  The miso ramen is average in flavor and the noodles in the ramen taste like they are mass produced product, overall the miso ramen was subpar.  \n\nIn addition to sub-average food, the kitchen and server weren't sure if shellfish was an ingredient in the pork ramen broth nor were they sure if shellfish was an ingredient in the chicken ramen broth.  This lack of ability to answer a food allergy question puzzled me when we ordered, but once I ate the poor meal it made more sense to me-apparently nobody knows nor gives a crap about what's going into the food or what's going out of the kitchen.\n\nI lied, this is not short, the more I thought about Umami the more I was compelled to write.\n\nDon't go, it's a 2.5 star restaurant, it sucked.",2
"My cat was diagnosed with fatty liver disease. Penny is 2 1/2 and was going to die from liver failure. As you can imagine this was a very intense situation for me. Up to this point, I have spent $2500.00 on her. I was referred to VetMed by my local vet because my cat need a procedure that my vet didn't perform. Penny needed a feeding tube and VetMed charged me $1900.00. OBVIOUSLY this is a lot of money for a single mom who's in finals at school to fork over, so at the time of service I inquired about everything being inclusive in that price. e.g. Was I going to have to pay to take this out etc. The vet told me that everything was included in the price. Great. Thank you. Have a great day while I go home and tube feed my cat. However, that was not the case. A few days ago I received a call informing me that my cat will need weekly dressing changes and guess what? It's not included in the price, it's about $30.00 a week. For a dressing change? That takes 5 minutes? That cost pennies on the dollar? I'm starting to believe that these so-called pet lovers love the money and not your pet. How hard is if for them to do the right thing and change my cats dressing so she doesn't get an infection on top of everything else she's got to deal with? \n\nYeah, I'll do it myself. Thank you VetMed for nickel and diming me. Real great of you.",0
"We tried this burger joint and I had ordered the chicken tacos, they come in either 2 or 3 with sides of guac and sour cream for extra if you like. My dish came with a side of beans and some salsa. It was just ok. My bf ordered a teriyaki burger but he didn't like it much. It seemed very soggy and the bread was not very good and it looked hard to eat and messy. He ended up having to use a fork and knife to eat it. The cool thing is the fries are endless. I liked the fries because they were thick and made from fresh potatoes, and you can order as many as you like! He also had the chocolate shake which was not bad. We also had buffalo wings for an appetizer and it was soso. We tried t mudslide dessert which was mocha, chocolate ice cream pie, yum.",1
"The worst club ever. I came from China. I went to little darling yesterday night,  they Took me to the private room, I was very happy and they asked for $600 bucks for the service. That's not too much for me but after they asked me :Do u want a happy ending? I said :How much is that? That bitc h told me it's $4000 bucks.i was like \""wtf?\"" And they don't let me go(they even didn't put me pants off) i asked for some discount.finally we made deal it's $2400 bucks.P.S. Don't bring  any of ur friends go Little daring.",0
"This mall is very mediocre.  When you compare it to Fashion Square, Chandler  Fashion  or even some outdoor malls like Desert Ridge and Tempe Marketplace....it doesn't seem to live up to its name.  It is called Paradise Valley Mall after all.  I have been coming to this mall since the 80's and feel it needs a major renovation.  The mall itself is very dark inside and several stores are left empty. \n\nHere are the things that I do like about PV Mall:  great for moms to visit with their kids; family restrooms and nursing area. They have a weekly story time that you can sign up for which includes a free ride on the carousal. They have a train that runs throughout, perfect for little kids, a few good anchor stores, a Starbucks inside and that's about it!",1
"This hotel was a waste of money. I mean the first day, the fire alarm went off at 10 am. Second TV is really old n does not work. When I call to fix TV, no one came so for three night, I had no TV. Third, the shower heads has molds or green thing around shower heads. DONT PAY OR GO TO THAT HOTEL. YOU PAY WAT YOU GET FOR. This the truth. Do your search for another hotel. Thanks.",0
"Dimanche 7 avril 2013\nEggstyle est un endroit \""styl\u00e9\"" pour d\u00e9jeuner mais le menu ne l'est pas. Les plats sont en tous points pareils \u00e0 ceux rencontr\u00e9s dans tous les autres endroits \u00e0 brunch avec, en plus, un service lent, un stationnement pratiquement impossible, c'est un endroit beaucoup trop petit pour la quantit\u00e9 de clients qui y arrivent, combin\u00e9 avec un service trop lent, c'est le chaos. Les prix sont trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ce que vous y mangez.\n\nSunday april 7th 2013\nEggstyle is simply a \""stylish\"" place to eat, nothing more. The menu doesn't follow. Everything is the same as any other brunch place and more to that, slow service or really slow service, impossible parking (no accessible parking spot or very hard to find), it's too small for all the clientele it receives, combined with a slow service, it's chaos. The prices are high in comparaison to what you really get.",1
"I feel a bit let down by my curry I ate last night... and curry is such a warm dish. You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment. \n\nSo why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman. \n\nRoom for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay. \n\nThey used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. \n\nThe better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears). \n\nOverall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location. You also can eat without a reservation at 5 if you can be done eating by 630. The prices are decent for portion size... Service is prompt polite and they will offer more rice if you need it. I think I'll try some other dishes and hope for a better outcome next time.",2
"This movie theater is less crowded than most which is a major plus but the seats are broken and it's flat (meaning if someone big is sitting in front of you, you wont see anything).. I really wish it was elevated. \n\nThe customer service was great and this place was clean and so was the restrooms. \n\nI do go to this movie theater often but again, I don't enjoy the seats... :[",2
"Let me start by saying I have never had BBQ I didn't like. I've had BBQ I could do without, but never that I didn't like. Went in for lunch today and I was the only customer, so I figured cool I will get good service no matter what. The girl sat me and was very pleasant and indicated my waitress would be right over. About ten minutes later, watching the waitress talk on a personal phone call at the bar the whole time, the girl who sat me came over to take the order. She walked up, didn't say a word, and just stared at me. Ok I can live with that it was only a minor inconviencence. \n\nGot the #4 lunch chopped pork sandwich with beans and a lemonade and it came out very quickly. Possibly because the beans were Bush's or the like? They tasted like canned baked beans heated up in a microwave. Not cool. The sandwich was ok at best. Thinking back on Stacy's, Honey Bear's, and other great BBQ spots, this one was not even in the same arena. I'll have to go back though and try a sandwich with the correct sauce on it. There was one sauce on the table which after reading reviews here I had assumed was the BBQ sauce. It looked a little watery but I thought whatever its NC style, and it may have been because it was a bit vinegary. On the way out I noticed every other table had a red sauce labeled BBQ, so I guess they have two different ones. I would have preferred the red one I assume. \n\nThere was no atmosphere, the place was run down (doesn't appear to have been remodeled after Shish Kabob House vacated) and was generally a dirty feeling place. Seeing as they didn't have any customers at lunch time, I'm assuming the place is going to lose money today. Don't know about other days, but they better get their act together quick or it is going to fail.",1
"The Eggery is the exact same franchise as the Good Egg down at Park Central, just fussied up with a different name. Exact. Same. Menu. Bleh. Had I known, I would have just taken a stroll through the gayborhood to get to the Good Egg, where there is outdoor seating, the people watching is superior, and the pigeons have balls the size of grape tomatoes.\n\nAlas, the Eggery is the Good Egg's fat, dorky older sister. The service is completely adequate -- nothing horrific, nothing staggering. The food is average, but somehow always arrives cold. At our last visit, there was a metric shit ton of people waiting (including a sweet aging tranny in a muumuu, chartreuse ankle socks, and chunky black heels) but the restaurant proper was only half full, if that. Why? \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be back. There's too many other amazing breakfast places in Phoenix and way too few precious available weekend mornings...",1
"Arrived at terminal 3 went to frontier checking and thought the person taking\n me in was rude. Wanted a different seat. Ask if I wanted to up grade. Moving over a seat in same row is upgrade, would cost me .  Then looked at medical bag and wanted to charge   Cheap cheap cheap. Flying is becoming joke.

"Generic booze and devoid of character Cargo is not a great bar, but it is relatively cheap. Another reviewer used the term cavernous and it is a good description, Cargo is a big bar, likely Ideal for a (very) large group of students or workmates and it seems to be a standard stopping point for hen nights using the \""boogie bus\"" (can't remember the correct name) to do a pub crawl.\n\nAll in all if the best you expect is generic beer/cider along with Captain Morgans (spice and dark!), Gordons and Smirnoff I am sure you could have a cheap night out here. Myself I will stick to Lock 25 or Lebowski's and drink something I enjoy.",1
"I have been awaiting this Smashburger's opening for one year...yes, a year!  It is a teeny sized building but I guess for a Smashburger it's enough..or NOT. It is in a busy neighborhood, Cotswold,  and we have been in need of a good burger joint for a LONG time. I have been there 6 times now, anytime from 2pm til they close. I find there is always a 'line' of folks awaiting their \""\""to go\"" orders, sometimes with friends and there IS little room inside the S/B to wait. The area to do so, is directly in front of the pick-up counter and in direct line to the drink machine. Last night I counted 11 people packed along the 'take out bar' (the bar really serves no purpose), 4-5 employees trying to get the orders sorted, and walk-thru traffic trying to get to the drink machine and it was 8PM (not the busiest time). There is NO drive-thru, but maybe there ought to be if for no other reason than to pick-up the take out orders??\nThe burgers are decent. They are as good as what I might make at my home IF I had more than myself to cook for. I like the toppings assortment, and the buns available just to mix it up a bit. Some toppings you pay extra for, some not. They are PRICEY even for today's prices in meats etc....$10.40 for a burger and small fries is just HIGH. I got a regular size Smashburger and an order of fries (I got the regular ones).  They skimped on the fries and they were not hot, but I didn't know that and will check next time before I leave. I live 1 mile away and like to knosh on the fries as a walk home. I am not fond of the 'smash sauce', and will not have that on my burger in the future. I am a weightloss surgery patient and they allowed me to order off the kids meal menu like most of the other Charlotte restaurants do, which is one of the MAIN reasons I go to any restaurant  these days.\nI can't really offer any information on any of the other food choices as MY main comings & goings here will be for the burgers. It was worth the wait, for me. I like knowing that my $6+ burger is cooked to order and has not been precooked or sitting under a heat lamp! They have me for a while.",2
"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER. We had purchased a groupon for an appointment. It was a very special day--Our one year anniversary. We were already there waiting for her. She called 10 minutes before our appointment and said she had to cancel. It ruined our anniversary. She then told us that we can reschedule for any day after that day. We tried calling again and leaving messages that were not returned asking for the next Saturday. She didn't get back to us until THAT day and told us she can't schedule us until 2 weeks later. So we schedule for two weeks later. THEN on the same day as our appointment, she canceled 1 and a half hours before our appointment!!! Terrible way to run a business!!",0
"Holy cow, sensory overload.  We stopped in for breakfast since we had to go to Postino that day (another story entirely...)\n\nDo I want to get a shirt?  A knick knack? A notebook?  Order some cake?  Some breakfast? Perhaps a pizza?  What about a bottle of wine? Coffee?  Fresh squeezed juice?  And nevermind the fact we were there at 11am when they started offering pizza....people started to lose their minds. \n\nThere is a LOT going on in here.  Almost too much.  But to their credit, they definitely have their act together.  It could have easily been chaos but ordering and receiving our food went smoothly.\n\nOnce I recovered from the initial \""oh my god, what is going on here?\"" shock, I ordered the Jersey girl.  It was decent, slightly watery, and for some reason it came with cabbage in it which was not listed as an ingredient on the menu and was a little odd.  My husband ordered the Zuni burrito which he found to be good.  I have to be honest, none of the food was mind blowing.  It wasn't bad....it just wasn't mouth watering or savory.    The coffee was satisfactory, the orange juice surprisingly good, unlike at other places here where I have had fresh squeezed oj, but $3.75 is a tad ridiculous for juice.   I have to say that I really wished they had other offerings for breakfast, while everything looked good, it wasn't anything I can't make myself or find elsewhere.  (Some of the options sounded just like what I make for breakfast every day)  \n\nI will probably drop back in some time to try the pizza out but I'm not in any real hurry to get back.   When I go out for breakfast or brunch I prefer it to be more leisurely than the LGO experience\n\n3.5 for now until I can sample further menu items.",2
Lately the quality of service at Panda has definitely deminished. I've have been a customer for a long time. When I ask for my plate to be made the way I like it I've been argued with by the employees. Most of the meat is made with alot of vegetables. Therefore when they serve you with the small entree that they give you for meat it seems to always be filled with more vegetables then meat. When I request for them to try not to give me so much vegetables I'm told that I will have a smaller portion of food not more meat. I simply don't understand why you would rather argue with your customer then to satisfy them. Obviously this company has become so big that the quantity of food left in there trays is more important then the quality of service they are giving.,0
"I wish I could dual rate.  If so I would give the food a 4 but the service a .5 better yet a 0.  Our waiter left everything to be desired.  First when asking if he recommended the Corn Chowder I was quickly schooled that nothing would be on the menu if it wasn't good.   Thanks dude.  Then he jacked up my teenagers order by bringing him his side but not his sandwich.   When asked his response was to pull out the fourth chair, sit down and school my son on how to order a sandwich.  Still stunned.  I think his name was Dave or Dan.  Will eat there again but will ask to be seated with someone else.",2
"When our son started here 2 years ago it was amazing . The instructors were phenomenal and my son really LOVED karate.  They pushed several competitions throughout the year so we decided to train for one and try it.  My son was only 4 at the time of his first competition.  We paid A LOT of money on top of the already expensive tuition to have one on one sessions to train for competition.  When it came time for the competition we found out they don't send their instructors and we were completely on our own.  EVERY other studio sends instructors along with a team of supporters for their competitors.  We continued to compete, and the kids who represented Sandoval usually ended up with first place wins.  Their training and trainer was amazing, but was often denied permission to attend competitions.  The kids were NEVER recognized for their achievements on their website or Facebook page.  Karate was my son's main passion and now it's really fizzled out.  He was in the same class for over 9 months and had so many younger/new kids join that he completely dominated the class when the sparred.... not in a good way because it didn't make him any better of a fighter.  Sad to see it go downhill so fast but we won't be back.",0
"Went there for lunch with 5 coworkers. Nobody liked the food and the atmosphere was horrible. Sat under a TV blaring Chinese news at a table with an off kilter lazy susan that pushed our dishes into our laps. \nThe staff had to be flagged down several times - to bring forks, to fill water, to ask for the check, etc...\nI had the orange chicken which was overly wangy with a cloying citrus sauce and large chunks of orange peel that I accidentally chewed on (and spit out) a couple times. yuck.\n10 bucks (including tax and tip) for chicken, white rice, diet coke, and a headache.\nNot going back.",0
"I've been trying several different chinese buffets in my area, and EZ Buffet is the only one I've been back to.  It's not much to look at, but I do think the recessed ceilings are nice.  I appreciate that they have several different vegetable offerings instead of just one as other places have.  I especially enjoyed the sauteed cabbage.  I also liked the lo mein, and really really like their hot and sour soup.\n\nI haven't tried the sushi, but their dessert selection is kind of sad.   The second time I went they didn't have any cookies to dip in the tapioca pudding.",2
"I no longer frequent the WISCO due to the regulars who think they can harass and threaten visitors.

A dive bar is one thing, but the threat of violence is too high in the last few years. Ironic since it used to be a biker bar.",0
"Ok so this Copps had rhubarb and the Copps on highway C and Windsor didn't. That is why I am giving it 3 stars. Other than that, I feel like I have a love hate relationship with Copps. I'll go into more details later when I update this review. I just feel like I am there all the time and never impressed. Sometimes there are ok deals and sometimes there are just disappointments like the meat and seafood counter where the selection looks old and not very fresh. I understand that there are not many Italians in Wisconsin but for the love of God.... what major grocery store doesn't carry soppresatta or Genoa salami at the deli counter? The bread at bakery is always fresh at reasonably priced too so that makes up for some of the disappointments.",2
"We had a Groupon to Alize, and wanted to check out what was recommended to us by a couple tourists at the Wynn.\n\nWe arrived for an early dinner, around 6PM, as we had a show in the Palms that night at 8.  It was slow at Alize, so we were really able to relax and enjoy the views.\n\nThe presentation here is superb.  The wait staff is knowledgeable, the wine list is excellent (though very expensive, with very few mid-level options), and the appetizers were delicious - we tried the veal cheek.\n\nThe issue here was the main courses.  They simply weren't very good.  We both ordered our steaks (one rib-eye and one filet mignon) medium rare, and one came out rare (rib-eye) and one came out beyond well-done.  Even at rare, the meat was tough somehow.  \n\nThe sides were very good, but small.  The potatoes with the filet were fried bits of dough - no taste outside of oils and minimal starch.\n\nNeedless to say, we didn't stick around for dessert after being underwhelmed with the main courses.\n\nIf you're looking for a view, check it out for a drink - I just don't recommend staying for the food.  So many options in Las Vegas that dominate this performance.",0
"I gave been coming to this Paradise Bakery and Cafe on and off for 6 years since we moved to Phoenix.  We moved from Dallas where impeccable service is essential to survive in the restaurant business.  I came in to order a espresso drink and oatmeal.  No attempt to start making the coffee while there is no one else at the counter or a line.  I sit down to wait for the coffee and oatmeal. 10 minutes later the oatmeal comes and no coffee.  I have to ask someone to check on the coffee. 15 min later the coffee comes!  And the cafe mocha was horrible!\n\nThis place used to be ok, but in the last 2 years the service is pitiful.  A similar incident happened several months ago and I swore I would stop coming, but I had to use the last of a gift card.  Never again.  All my friends have also stopped coming because of the slow and poor service.  Too bad, because PB&C in Dallas is awesome.  Gives the company a bad reputation.",0
Was there 3 months ago and had horrible service. It took forever to get our food then when it finally came it was not only wrong but cold. The manager apologized and comped most of the meal. We went back tonight and had another bad experience. We got our drinks and appetizer without a problem but then sat for over 30 mins waiting for our food. The waitress came over and said they had been having kitchen trouble all day but it would be out in 2 mins. 3 mins later she sits down at another customers table chatting with them. Another lady came over and apologized and said our food should be coming. I told her it had been over 30 mins and the waitress told us 2 mins 3mins ago. She assured me it was coming and another few mins went by before our food came. Everything was cold. The fries seemed like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time and the cheeseburgers were stone cold. I had my 2 and 4 year old children with me who were out of patience and hungry. I told the waitress after waiting that long and then getting cold food we were leaving and not paying. She rolled her eyes at me. The waitress was Francis. I am disappointed and we will not be returning.,0
"A pleasant waitress, nice plating, reasonable pricing but surprisingly uninspired flavors. Ambiance within restaurant is nice, but surrounded by full-view, busy, garishly-lit shopping center parking lot. Staff and management a little insensitive to the dining experience. They just don't seem to be trying very hard for excellence. Although we've been in years past, this was our third attempt in recent months, being turned away at 9:30P on two separate weekend nights because of limited hours. Too many better choices nearby to bother with Dolce again. Luisa is frankly better at the pizza business.",1
"Was an ok hip-hop club. The cover was 20 for girls and 30 for guys. My drink (Vodka and Cranberry juice) didn't taste that strong. Once you leave, you cannot go back in, and it gets really stuff pretty fast. I loved the music, but the DJ would play it for like 30 seconds and switch. That annoyed me to no end. Would I go back? I hope I don't have to.",1
"While my boyfriend and I were in Vegas I was on a mission to buy some pigalle 120s. The first stop we went to was this CL store at the Forum Shops at Caesars. The first time we came in the sales associate was very friendly and very helpful when helping me figure out which size to get in the pigalle 120s. Unfortunately, they didn't have my size in the 120s but she did offer to give me a business card and told me to call and check stock every so often.\n\nAfter thinking about it for awhile I decided I would maybe try the pigalle 100s so we headed into the shop again at the forum shops. When we walked in it was completely different associates than I saw the first time I went it. First of all, let me say that the ladies that work there don't even look like they work there. I was admiring the pigalle 100s for like a good 10 mins when someone FINALLY asked me for help. I asked her for my size and she went back to look but she didn't even come back to tell me. So I asked another associate if the had the sizes and she came back and told me they didn't. They are very snobby there and will only help you if you look like you have money. The girl next to me had a salvatore ferragamo shopping bag and they were helping her like no other. I wanted to try one more size to see how it felt and I asked the lady and she said the smallest size they had was a 35, but i was asking for a 36... that made absolutely no sense. If the smallest size you have is a 35 wouldn't you have other sizes as well??? \n\nThe first associate that helped me as very helpful and I hope whoever goes in there is fortunate enough to get her, but as far as customer service the second time I went there it was HORRIBLE! They are very snobby, rude, not knowledgeable, and look unprofessional!!!!!",0

"This the worst sign company in the valley.  I literally waited months for my signs to come in ...all this and they charged my credit card long before I received my signs.

"Disappointed is the only way to describe my encounter with Curry in the Box.  I purchased a coupon from Get My Perks and I tried to used it the second day from the last that it expired.  Unfortunately I did not read the fine print very carefully, it said dine in only.  I had already ordered ahead and had it ready for carry out.  When I got there the cashier pointed out to me that the coupon did say dine in only, she then got a manager for me.  Even after pleading with the manager, he insisted that he would not honor the coupon.  He said that the coupon was designed to get new people to come in the door.  I explained that I was a new customer and had never been there before and that I wouldn't have come in if it hadn't been for the coupon, so it worked.  If I had liked it I would be coming back as a return customer.  Still he was insisted he would not honor the coupon.  He said if I would like they would un bag it and let me sit in the dining room and eat it ????? What the heck!  My husband was at home waiting for me so I was not about to eat it at a restaurant by myself.  In the end the manager decided to let me walk out and not accept the coupon on food that was already made, bagged and ready to go.  He told me I could come back some other time to use the coupon, even though I already explained that it expired the next day.  Even though I really wanted to try the food at Curry in the Box I decided that I would not be a customer now or in the future due to the complete lack of respect and rudeness that I was treated with. Get My Perks graciously credited my account the money that I spent on the coupon for future use.",0
"This place was so busy!  Because this part of town needed a new/additional breakfast place.  It's not fancy but it was new, cute, clean.  And we loved the food.  Service was great even on a very busy Sunday.  5 of us ate for cheap and we loved it.  It didn't take long to get seated either because this is a decent sized place.  I definitely would recommend it, and I will go back, even if they are busy.",2
"It's quite quick typically... However, it takes a year and a day to receive a beverage during lunch when only two people are working at the juice bar. It was crazy to notice how long it took them to make one \""green giant\"" juiced beverage. It took 5 minutes . I came to experience something other than office coffee but it's not particularly helpful to spend my lunch waiting",2
"Stayed here just for a night when I was in town to see NIN at the US Airways Center. The price was super cheap and HGI's are my favorite brand of Hilton so it was a no brainer.\n \nPros: shuttle to and from airport. A block away from public transit (the shuttle will take you/pick you up there if you ask.) Coupons for a free well drink if you're Diamond (I'm guessing Gold too but don't quote me). I didn't use it but it's a nice gesture.\n\nCons: not much around the hotel so you need to have a car or be content with transit to get food, etc.)\n\nI'd definitely stay here again if I was in Phoenix for an event or if I was stuck in Phoenix due to a mishap at the airport.",2
"Ten members of my family made reservations for Sunday brunch today for mother's day! Horrible experience for service and especially the food! First off for 35 dollars per person their hardly was any food out, and what was out was dried out and hardly edible. So right off the bat 3 people in our party decided against doing the brunch because of how bad it looked so they ordered from the menu. I would love to tell you how that was but they never received their food. The rest of us still tried the brunch because the waitress promised more food...nothing got better even down to not having any plates. They weren't even busy so I don't know what happened with that. Worst part was we told the waitress how we felt and I'm sure she could see how displeased we were and didn't even offer to make things right...so after 230.00 Bill we left hungry and angry. By the way at least 2 different customers were nodding their head and felt how we did...do yourself a favor pay 10 bucks more and hit up the Phoenician for mother's day brunch.",0
"You get a lot of food for the price, but the food doesn't deliver. We ordered the pepperoni pretzel appetizer thinking it was going to be oven baked pretzels with pepperoni served with the cheese dip. What we got was pretzel rods from a bag with cold pepperoni slices wrapped around them. The cheese dip was good but was cold by the time it made it to the table. Major disappointment. We kept an open mind for the main entrees. My friend got the bacon Mac n cheese burger with the house fries. The burger was huge but thin and didn't have a lot of Mac n cheese on it. The fries were dusted with seasoning and were decent. It was ok but the burger and truffle fries at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant Burgr were A LOT better. I had the Caesar salad which was enormous and by far the beat dish of  the meal. The salad was freshly tossed, cold and the croutons were delicious. Overall, a lack luster experience that failed to meet expectations.",1
I love their food but the service sucked didn't get waited on until 10mins later while I waited I over herd them B.S.ing in the back then when I did get waited on the person who took my order was a smarta** and made comments that u don't make very unprofessional,1
Good property that offers a great escape when on business without the generic hotel feel. The setting is fabulous and it's located in good proximity to the airport. Tip: Be sure to request an upgraded room. Service has always been great but the dinner menu is really quite disappointing and the wine selection is even worse!,2
"Overall, Menchie's in a decent fro-yo option in the Dilworth area. \n\nPlenty of flavors to try. Most are sweet with only 2 tart options when I visited. The flavors do rotate. I liked the consistency, not too creamy and not icy.  Some of the flavors definitely made me think soft serve and not fro yo... Good? Bad? Undecided. But I noticed that it melted really fast. By the time I dispensed it into my cup, put the toppings on, and paid for it, there was a decent melted pool in the bottom of my cup. That made me a little sad. They had some samples of their fresh made waffle cones/bowls. Delish. I would definitely recommend their waffle products!\n\nI teeter totter between liking self-serve vs. full serve fro yo places. Menchie's is a self-serve joint. Which means: \na) You can sample as many flavors as you want. Just grab the small paper sample cups on the counter. \nb) You can put all 12 flavors in one cup if you so desire\nc) You can top away and decorate to your hearts desire.\n\nBut I must warn you, self serve places definitely have their negatives. \na) So, when you pay by the ounce you gotta be careful how much you put in that cup. They only offer one size cup, which is quite large(!) and easy to fill if you aren't swift handed with the dispensing lever. The toppings bar is quite dangerous as well... Fill up your cup too much and you may be walking away with an $8 cup of fro yo. My cup was around $5 and I felt like I went pretty easy filling up the cup. It was maybe 1/2 full. \nb) Toppings are also self-serve... I try not to think of the bogger picking little fingers that have been all over those scoops. But hey, some germs never killed anyone right... think of it as free immune system training! \nc) The toppings bar options weren't that great/healthy. They had plenty of dry toppings - crushed cookies, cereal, gummi bears, choco chips, and many other hfcs laden options. But I thought the fresh fruit area was lacking. The fruit I saw was cut into large, unappealing chunks and some of it didn't look all that fresh. \n \nWhile not my favorite fro yo joint in the QC, it does deserve a mention. I like this location better than other Menchie's locations I've visited (it's a franchise). Sign up for a Smileage card if you are a frequent visitor.",2
"Irish version of Hooters?\n\nI guess this is the type of place people will go to see young college girls in skimpy clothes, not necessarily for the food. I went here after a baseball game to grab some food and some beer. We ordered their wings and garlic fries to share. The wings were just horrible. We asked for a mixture of their hot sauce and their sweet and spicy sauce and grilled. The waitress totally commended us for that decision and said it was sooo good. And it wasn't. It was TERRIBLE. The wings were so greasy and the sauce was incredibly lackluster. We left most of them on the plate and believe me, that NEVER happens with me and  food.  The garlic fries....meh. I really think they could use some more garlic but maybe that is just my personal preference. \n\nAs far as the service, the girls were very friendly. But when our food was set down, they did not bring two little plates and we were missing silver ware. We kept trying to grab someone's attention and it took forever. When we needed our check, our waitress was nowhere to be seen. \n\nSome of their beer cocktails looked pretty interesting. So now I know that this place is mainly for drinking and I will only go again if the people I am with want to go there for the novelty. \n\nThe view of downtown from the second story is very nice!",1
"Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH, I don't know what else I could have done.. \n\nBefore every haircut I explain that I am very particular about the length of my hair -- I want to keep it long, it grows very slowly, that it is IMPERATIVE to only cut a TINY AMOUNT off, etc, etc. I made this extremely clear to the stylist. She promised that she \""wouldn't do anything crazy..\""\n\nLet's just say I am using this as a cathartic outlet for my experience because I went in for a trim but left with FOUR INCHES missing from my hair. I'm still recovering aesthetically and emotionally from this trauma! It just doesn't make sense to me why a stylist would do exactly the opposite of what was requested. I think maybe she is used to cutting children's hair and not listening to them. But either way, what should have been a really quick/easy trim, turned into one of the most extreme haircuts of my life. It all could have been so easily avoided. It doesn't feel fair. \n\nProceed with caution..",0
"I only give this place 3 stars because our waiter was really nice. The salsa's were not spicy and in need of salt. The Fajitas were so-so. The Flan looked gross. My Margarita was like a slush.  There has to be better Mexican food out there!\n\nOh, but the corn tortillas were really good.",2
"This store destroyed the stellar 8 year customer service streak with Apple.  From mentioning multiple times you can reserve phones on launch day in line to eventually being told they don't do reservations, calling and being told I would be called back then eventually having phones setup not being asked which line is for which phone and of course they are setup wrong.\n\nBig iPhone launch day shenanigans, avoid Apple Store on launch day and for weeks afterward. They seemingly hire hipster temp employees whose job is to be a hipster, make you happy aka buying mood and get you out the door.",0
"Blech! Eek! Yuck! Went here last Saturday with my compadres, Myles M, Kristin S and a few others. We had been day drinking substantially and still thought the food was barely edible. Having grown up in California, I am completely aware of the variety of \""Mexican food\"" that exists. I've had true authentic food with cactus, Americanized Tex Mex like they serve at places like Chevy's and drive-through places like Filiberto's, and I'm ok with eating at the less authentic end of the spectrum. That being said, I still expect my food to be made with decent ingredients, to be flavorful and to be a good value for the money. And the food at Macayo's is none of those. \n\nThe special shrimp burrito we got had a decently spicy sauce, but the tortilla was soggy and greasy. The Spanish rice was the worst I've ever had. My friend's \""grilled veggie\"" fajitas were overcooked, mushy, STEAMED veggies like carrots and broccoli. What a curse to be a vegetarian in this joint! The house salsa was OK but I've had better from a jar. \n\nThe only saving grace of this place was that it was crowded and lively on a Saturday night (always something I miss dining in Central Phoenix). The pitcher of margaritas we got was also decent and not too sweet. \n\nSorry, Obama, and sorry to everyone else who gave this place a decent review. Macayo's sucks and I'm not afraid to say it.",1
"Worst experience!!! We sat down and our host had to come over 3 times before our waitress even came over. And come to find out the hostess was our server. Apparently some miscommunication between the staff. The place was dead and another couple that had arrived 10 minutes after us got an appetizer before our order was even taken. They were over staffed. We could see four servers stranding around talking. It took almost 40 minutes for us to get our food and it was terrible! Paid the bill and got out of there. My boyfriend spoke with the manager who was outside on his cell phone and he managed our concerns very poorly. Didn't even offer to take care of part of he meal or offer us some sort of deal to come back. Terrible service, terrible food. Never going back again!",0
"Meh. I didn't find this pub to be anything special, but that might be because it was cold and rainy when we visited, so we didn't take advantage of any of the outdoor seating.\n\nDrink prices were on a par with other places in the area, but really, there are plenty of other places to drink that are more interesting and/or charming. \n\nThere was nothing really WRONG with the Beehive, it was fine to stop in for a midafternoon drink and relax for awhile, but there are certainly better places to visit, so I wouldn't be a repeat customer.",1
"This place has gone completely down the toilet. Went there with my wife for Mother's Day and they ruined the day. The server Thomas was dense, like he was on drugs. An appetizer was supposed to come with the meal - that never happened. Talked to the manager about it. He apologized and promised a free dessert. The bill came and I was indeed charged for the dessert.\nBeware, don't go there until they start drug testing! Your money will be better spent anywhere else. They were once good, no more. Crack is Whack Genghis Grill!",0
"This was another restaurant that I really wanted to like. The wait for the table wasn't a big deal at all, it was a Friday night at 7 - needless to say, we knew what we were getting in to. But the hour wait after that to get food was awful...  especially when you are only getting a couple of tacos. Very tiny tacos at that. Then it took and another 30 min to get the check and pay our bill - no bueno Between our small party, we had duck, snapper, shrimp, steak, lamb and chicken tacos. All were 'meh', nothing to come back for. My friend said the lamb was good, but not something going out of his way for. The specialty drinks were equally unimpressive, and the very average house margarita was still ten bucks. Just for me, 3 tacos and 2 drinks was 37 bucks, for food that was tiny and nothing special to boot! \n\nThe design of the building was very cool, well done ambiance (but some really douchey people congregating at the bar who wouldn't move out of the isle as I am trying to walk by with my 4 month old sleeping baby.)\n\nThe tequila list looked impressive, but I am not going to spend $200 on a single shot of tequila. Again, everything was in place for a cool dining experience - then the food and service got in the way. (Although either the manager or owner who sat us was very kind and accommodating)",1
"It is a local's casino. I come here whenever I visit my folks who live about 10 minutes away. It is not as fancy as the casinos on the strip and that is what I expect. They cater to locals. I enjoy the table games, slots, and restaurants. It is simply a place to drop a few dollars and spend an evening out.",2
"Stayed here initially for a night and ended up staying 3 nights. The front desk supervisor is awfully pushy and has a short fuse. This is an fairly old, paint-over- paint hotel. I don't think the A/C filter had ever been changed, chunks of dirt were falling out. I almost took it out myself. My room was super small, but they told me about this at check in. I didn't mind. The safe was gross, covered in all sorts of things being adjacent to the side of the bed. I was on Floor 19 and the noise from Fremont was not all that bad. But the noise of the old clunky A/C, although working well, and the constant elevator noise (and people waiting on the elevator) was pretty loud. Saturday night was the noisiest. Also, Sunday morning the whole top floor reeked of burnt fish..maintenance was spraying stuff to try and mask it but no go. Also, the smoke and other smells from outside your room, do get in. There is something really wrong with the HVAC here or something. But I would stay here again for the price.",2
"We used to eat here quite a bit, but the quality has gone down. The chicken was always moist and fresh, but the last five or so times it has been dried out and flavorless. We usually order 'to-go', but the last time we ate in I was surprised by the lack of cleanliness. I'd like to see them clean up and learn to serve chicken safely without it tasting like saw dust.",1
"Station Casinos has a lot of great properties in Vegas. But I'm not a fan of Santa Fe Station. It's got a layout that's just odd. It's kinda cramped, it's kinda blah, and it's not really the kind of place I felt comfortable in. Sure it's got theaters, it's got a Cabo, it's got Revolver, but the core casino is about as ho-hum as it gets. \n\nUnless you want to visit one of the previously mentioned side attractions the best view of Santa Fe Station is from the 95 with the speedo showing 65 mph and your foot nowhere near the brake pedal.",2
too easy. DO NOT eat here. \n\nits like a big buffet full of nothing. the old asian inspired theme was shabby. and the food. nothing near the asian style. break fast was terrible. and the only thing that was slightly edible was pizza. they ran out and never replenished it. i thought this was a buffet. however. the desserts... were total embarrassment of that entire category. my mud pie was not even muddy. it was just a chunk of dirt that has already settled 24 hours AFTER the rain. done.\n\nno. don't do it.,0

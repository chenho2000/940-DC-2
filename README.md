# Data Challenge 2 for STAT940 Winter 2024

In this data challenge, we will practice how to use neural networks for the task of classification of how many stars a Yelp Review is. We will use a dataset of 6000 texts. Each text is labelled as either 1, 2, or 3 stars. The ID corresponds to the specific passage of text. The sample submission is an example of what you should be submitting. The train is the training data and the test is the testing data.
